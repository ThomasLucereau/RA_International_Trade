Investor Relations Manager

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining Adyen Q3 2025 Business Update Call. My name is Maggie O'Donnell, and I'm part of the Investor Relations team, and I'm happy to be joined today by Ethan Tandowsky, our Chief Financial Officer. In today's call, we'll discuss Adyen financial and business updates from the quarter, followed by a Q&A segment. As this session will be slightly shorter than our half-yearly earnings presentation, we ask you to keep your questions to one per person so that we can respond to as many of you as possible. When submitting your questions, please use the raised hand functionality on the bottom of your screen. With that, let's get started. Ethan, what were your key takeaways from this quarter?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:00:39
Sure. Thanks, Maggie. In the third quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth of 23% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We're continuing to see diversified growth across pillars as we expand share of wallet with our existing base. This quarter was especially characterized by consistent growth across regions and was also supported by the timing of settlements during the quarter as compared to last year. This quarter, our team grew by 86 FTEs, primarily in commercial roles in North America and in tech roles across our tech hubs. Overall, it was a strong quarter in line with our expectations.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:01:21
Great. Thanks, Ethan. Can you also just give us an update on the performance across pillars?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:01:26
Yes, happy to. I'll start with digital. Digital net revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum in the content and subscriptions and delivery and mobility verticals. We continue to see a headwind from APAC-headquartered merchants focused on online retail, but noted a slight improvement throughout the quarter. As we turn to Unified Commerce, we see that net revenue for the pillar was up 32% year-over-year. This is driven by strength across retail and successful execution of our strategy to expand share of wallet across channels. Finally, platforms. Net revenue was up 50% year-over-year, reflecting continued momentum in the SaaS segment. As we've mentioned before, our relationship with platforms typically starts with embedding payments, and we now have 31 of our platforms processing over €1 billion annually with us. Amongst our platforms, the number of underlying business customers reached 212,000, up from 126,000 this time last year.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:02:37
This growing number of business customers we see as an important indicator of our momentum towards the next phase of our growth. In short, Q3 was a quarter of solid broad-based growth across each of the three pillars.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:02:54
Great. Thanks for the summary. Now let's talk about the outlook for the rest of this year. Is there anything in particular you'd want to highlight?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:03:02
Yeah, so similarly to what we shared in August, we continue to expect full-year net revenue growth to be similar to H1 on a constant currency basis. Furthermore, we also continue to expect EBITDA margin expansion for the year. As we get closer to the end of the period covered by our financial objectives, we're also refining our net revenue expectations. We expect annual net revenue growth to be between the low 20s and mid-20s in 2026.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:03:33
Great, thanks. Before we go to Q&A, I'm sure most investors are wondering what we're planning to share at the Investor Day on November 11. Can you give a sense of the agenda for the day and what they can expect?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:03:45
Yeah, of course. First off, I'd say we're very much looking forward to hosting you all at our upcoming Investor Day, which will take place here in Amsterdam on November 11th. Typically, we host these days every couple of years to talk about our long-term strategy and how we plan to execute it to capture the market opportunity in front of us. You can expect us to talk about our core strengths and how we leverage them to set us apart in our space. Ultimately, how we see our long-term opportunity. This includes how we think about our tech infrastructure, innovation, and topics such as agentic commerce. Of course, we'll also connect that back to our business model by giving a sense of how we view the opportunity ahead. We're looking forward to a great event, and I'm personally really excited to see you all.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:04:37
Great, thank you, Ethan. For those interested in attending the Investor Day in person, formal registration has closed, but we do have a few spots left, so please reach out to Isaac and me at ir@adyen.com if you're interested in attending. We also will be live streaming the full event on our website at investors.adyen.com. We'll now transition to the Q&A segment of today's call. We'll get to as many questions as we can with the time remaining. Following the call, the IR team will, of course, be available to respond to any outstanding questions. All right, let's take a look at the questions we've received so far. Our first question comes from Fred Boulin at Bank of America. Fred, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Fred Boulan
Managing Director and Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:05:33
Hey, Ethan. Hey, Maggie. Hope you can hear me well.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:05:37
Yep, we can hear you great.
Fred Boulan
Managing Director and Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:05:39
Thanks. If you can discuss maybe any specific factors that have driven the underlying revenue acceleration we've seen in Q3 versus Q2, anything in particular you want to call out for the rest of the year beyond the kind of unwind of the settlement day timing? Maybe as a follow-up on that, looking at 2026 and the new guide that you've provided, should we assume a base case is now for a bit of an acceleration if I look at the midpoint of the guide, or it's a bit early to talk about that?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:06:14
Yeah, sure. If I talk through our growth in Q3, what is strong here is that our growth was really driven across quite a diversified set of customers, right? You see strength in each of the three pillars this quarter. We've also seen quite consistent growth across the regions. I think we're seeing strength in being able to expand our relationship with our existing customers across a really well-diversified set of our customer base. The other thing, of course, that you touched on is that we had some benefit from settlement days in this quarter. That was about 1% support to our growth in the third quarter, and we expect to have a similar-sized headwind in Q4 given the timing of settlement days next quarter.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:06:59
In terms of our guidance for next year, we set that guidance back in November 2023, and we've been quite open in sharing how we look and get insights into our revenues. That's around a 6 to 12-month type of view that we get around our revenue growth. That's because we're in constant conversations with our customers, and that's typically how they think about their own planning, their own roadmaps, their own priorities. As we start to get more and more visibility into what next year looks like, we wanted to refine our view and share that information with you all. We don't still have complete and total visibility on those expectations, so we're still working through that over the coming months. As we get more and more visibility, we'll give that view, but we're confident that we can deliver within the range that we've shared today.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:07:52
Great. Thanks for your question, Fred. The next question comes from Hannes Leitner from Jefferies. Hannes, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Hannes Leitner
Payments and FinTech Equity Research Analyst
0:08:00
Yes, thanks. I have also a question on you mentioned that digital saw some attrition towards the Unified Commerce pillar. Maybe you can elaborate on that. Within Unified Commerce, you talked about the luxury segment outgrowing the group performance in H1. Maybe you can talk about that trend, how that continued, and how long you think that will continue to grow.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:08:29
Yeah, sure. I would much more call it expansion than attrition. I think our strategy is about how do we grow, land our customers, and then expand with them. That can be across regions. That can be across sales channels, like in this case. That can even be around expanding to more brands. It really depends on the business. In this case, this is about adding an in-person payment sales channel to existing e-commerce businesses. That's a move that we see basically quarter after quarter as it is part of our strategy and part of how we can help our customers to solve for complexity. We called it out this quarter because we saw a more visible move in our digital volumes to Unified Commerce. This is just playing out our strategy as we always have.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:09:21
On your second question around Unified Commerce and how luxury is growing, I gave that example back in August because I wanted to share that the growth of our existing customer base is split between growth in share of wallet and their own growth. At that time, luxury was quite publicly not seeing strong market volume growth, but it was still for us an industry or vertical that was growing faster on our platform than the overall platform was growing, and that was due to share of wallet gains. We continue to see strength in that vertical, but it wasn't to explain all of our growth in Unified Commerce. I think what we've seen over past years is that we've actually really diversified across many more verticals. We call out entertainment. We call out hospitality.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:10:11
While we are seeing strength in retail, we're also seeing our customer base get much more diversified. I think that's the story of how we're growing so far this year.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:10:23
Great. Thanks for your question, Hannes. The next question comes from Justin Forsythe at UBS. Justin, please go ahead and ask your question.
Justin Forsythe
Payments and FinTech Lead Equity Research Analyst
0:10:31
Thank you very much, Ethan and Maggie. Just one question here. I wanted to come back on the largest cohort comments for 2025, new merchant cohort that is, that you made at the 1H. Maybe you can just confirm whether that's still in play based on the last three months' progression and also talk a little bit about where you're having success. I know you just mentioned and why. I assume, again, within that comment as well, you wouldn't be counting then any existing partners like LVMH or Shopify or Toast within that, so therefore aren't part of the 2025 cohort. Could we potentially be, given how strong this cohort is performing, at a high single-digit contribution versus the building block suggested contribution of mid-single digits?
Justin Forsythe
Payments and FinTech Lead Equity Research Analyst
0:11:18
Is there anything that's providing incremental opportunity, say, like the Worldpay Global Payments pending merger or any other broader macro shifts in the payments universe?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:11:28
Thanks, Justin. Indeed, the comment that we shared is if you looked at the 2025 cohort and compared it to the 2024 cohort, that this cohort was growing faster than the overall platform was growing. We continue to see that through the third quarter. These are indeed all new customers. These are customers who we are working with for the first time that are included there. Otherwise, it would indeed be expansion with our existing base. In terms of how it's shifted, I think maybe the only thing that I would call out is that if you look over the past couple of years, we've seen our pipeline move more to platforms than it was previously. A bigger proportion of the pipeline is now coming from platforms than in previous years.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:12:16
Other than that, it's the same things that are differentiating ourselves that have been differentiating ourselves over the past years. It's how do we drive the best payments performance, right? Uplift is a big part of that story, a combination of auth rates, and fraud, and authentication, and payments costs. It's again the platforms play. It's connecting sales channels across online and in-store. It is very much iterations on top of the differentiation that we've been driving over past years. That's the story of what we're seeing today. I think your question around what to expect for the building blocks going forward, I think it very much should have a similar impact in the next year. I think still mid-single digits is the right way to think about it. Of course, we see pretty consistent ramping from year one to year two.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:13:08
If this is a faster growing cohort, it should have some larger impact in 2026. The biggest part of our growth next year will come from our existing base still.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:13:19
Thanks for your question, Justin. The next question comes from Mohammed Moawalli from Goldman Sachs. Mo, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question. Sorry, that's my mistake. The next question comes from Adam Wood at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Adam Wood
Technology Equity Analyst
0:13:41
Hi, Ethan. Hi, Maggie. Thanks very much for taking the question. Maybe first of all, just to come back on the 2026 outlook, I guess if we look at the run rate today, you've got some exceptional headwinds in the business, the large merchants, the Chinese merchants, and eBay. I think you'd probably be a good few points ahead of what you've reported if we were to X those out. Is that a big part of why you'd still see mid-20s as a realistic outcome for next year? Are there any other things you'd highlight to give us comfort that that's still a realistic scenario? Maybe just secondly, as we look at the guide or the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, it does imply some decel. Obviously, the settlement headwind is part of that.
Adam Wood
Technology Equity Analyst
0:14:20
Is there a desire to flag that there'll be deceleration in the fourth quarter, or is it just the feeling that your guidance is specific enough already and there's no kind of clear signaling implied in that? Thank you.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:14:34
Thinking about 2026, first and foremost, I think it is easy to isolate and pick out one customer or another. When we've shared this guidance, it's been a reflection of the broad customer base that we have. When we take our current information about how we expect to grow with all of our customers across the platform, across all of our pillars, across all of our regions, again, a much more diversified base as we go year by year. This guidance range is the reflection of how we expect to grow with the width of them. Of course, you can pick out and isolate specific topics, but for us, it's really about the overall growth of our customer base on the platform.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:15:18
When we're in discussions with them and when we're trying to understand the opportunity size that we have going into next year, the visibility that we start to get puts us in the range that we shared today. In terms of what we're sharing for Q4, I think the main thing that we are sharing, which is different between Q3 and Q4, is the impact of settlement days. That was a 1% support to our growth this quarter, and we think that's a 1% or so headwind to our growth next quarter. We wanted to be sure that that was understood. On an annual basis, this has very little impact, but given where we are quarter by quarter, we wanted to share that. That's ultimately what we're sharing for our guidance through the rest of the year.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:16:06
Great. Thanks for your question, Adam. The next question comes from Adam Frisch at Evercore. Adam, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Adam Frisch
Senior Managing Director and Research Analyst
0:16:15
Thanks, guys, and congrats on the continued execution. I wanted to ask specifically about there are aspects to your growth algorithm that are specific to Adyen, obviously the growth with your existing base and so forth. I also wanted to ask you to specifically call out anything you're seeing in markets in Europe being particularly weaker, stronger, any view on the consumer. There's been a lot of mixed data points around there, and the fact that you guys are growing so well, maybe you have a different view. If you could just separate the Adyen specific stuff from what you're seeing in the overall market, it would be very helpful. Thank you.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:16:50
Yeah, thanks, Adam. I think the challenge is that they are mixed in our view of growth, right? Our growth with our existing customers is that combination of how fast they are growing with how fast we are gaining a proportion of their share, what we call share of wallet. We haven't flagged anything specific that we've been seeing related to changes in behavior here. I don't really have additional insights to share.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:17:22
Thanks for your question, Adam. The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Wells Fargo. Jason, can you please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question?
Jason Kupferberg
Senior Equity Research Analyst
0:17:34
Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back on one of the prior questions about Q4, make sure we have the numbers right here. We did 23% in Q3, would have been 22% without the settlement tailwind. I think the implied growth for Q4, if the second half is going to be the same as the first half, is 19%, which would be 20% if you add back the benefit of settlement. It does seem, if our numbers are right, like there's a little bit of a modest slowdown embedded in there. I don't know if this is more just, you know, rounding, but I just want to make sure we're synced up properly for Q4. Are you putting some cushion in there for macro or tariffs or any other items? Thank you.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:18:17
Yeah, I think what we've tried to share is a view on the year, right? Of course, we're getting now closer to the end of the year, so that timeframe gets shorter and shorter, but we've never been trying to guide to every specific quarter. It is our expectation that Q4 will not be at the same growth rate as Q3, given that settlement day impact. Q4 was also a very strong quarter for us last year, so the comparables are strong that we're comparing ourselves to. We still think that we're in a strong position to grow, but these are the factors ultimately in play, which lead us to continue with the expectation we shared back in August, which is that our growth for the full year should be broadly in line with the H1 constant currency growth.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:19:03
Great, thanks for your question, Jason. The next question comes from Darren Peller at Wolfe. Darren, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Darrin Peller
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:19:11
Hey, guys, thanks. Just two-part question. One is first on agentic commerce. I know we'll get a lot more at the Investor Day, which we're looking forward to, but maybe any quick preview on some of the initial ideas or plans or partnerships you see already and what your opinion is in terms of momentum on it in the next, let's call it, you know, two to three quarters from Adyen's perspective. The second part would be around hiring. I just, you know, we keep seeing, we continue to see the healthy pace of hiring. Evan, is this the run rate that we should expect sort of normalized for the company going forward in terms of, you know, call it the annualized rate we're seeing this quarter? How do you want us to think about that? Thanks again.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:19:49
Yeah, sure. I think first on agentic commerce, we're really excited about the potential to help customers meet their own customers where they want to engage in commerce. This is certainly an area that we think over time will develop and be an important piece for our customer base. At the moment, what we're doing is we're working with other industry leaders. Think about a Google or an OpenAI or Visa or Mastercard working together to make sure that we develop standards which will truly work for merchants, that will support them in their growth and their relationship with their own customer base. We are absolutely engaged and actively working together with others in this space to make sure that we deliver a really unique and differentiated solution for our customer base.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:20:36
Again, here, a lot of the challenges that we're really already strong at, things like authentication, things like managing fraud, things like multiple payment methods, those are things that are core strengths of ours and that we think we can apply in this realm as well. Of course, you mentioned it. We will share more at our Investor Day, but I think that's how I'd summarize our position today. In terms of hiring, yeah, we did 86 net new FTEs this quarter. I think the last two quarters we did about 110 each. That type of level is something that we would expect to continue. I have no reason to think that we need to scale that significantly up or significantly down over the next coming while. As of now, that's our plan. If that would change, I would, of course, let you know. That's our expectation going forward.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:21:35
Great. Thanks for your question, Darren. The next question comes from Harshita Rawat at Bernstein. Harshita, please go ahead and ask your question.
Harshita Rawat
Senior Research Analyst
0:21:43
Hi, good afternoon. I want to ask about Uplift, and I appreciate you're going to discuss it in more detail at the Investor Day. You've enabled it for all of your customers. What's the uptake been? I know you talked a little bit about it last quarter, the conversion boost you're seeing. Also, how should we think about wallet share gains as it relates to Uplift, especially as we look into next year? Thank you.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:22:08
Yeah, Uplift is a really important way that we package our differentiation to our customers. It continues to be that. The same updates we gave in H1 hold true through Q3. For instance, when we look at our new customers that we onboard, we still see around two-thirds of them or so using Protect from day one, so our fraud tooling. Ultimately, this combination of solving for authorization, solving for lowering payments costs, solving for better authentication flows, and reduction of fraud can be applied no matter the priorities of customers, right? If they want to focus fully on how do they drive revenue uplift, or if they want to manage payments costs more carefully, those are optimizations that they can control and tweaks that they can make. Uplift really helps them quantify the impacts and make it easier for them to ultimately take up these products.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:23:09
It's a really important part of our commercial conversations and how we help bring more share of wallet to the platform. It continues to progress well in Q3, similar to what we shared in H1.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:23:22
Thanks for your question, Harshita. The next question comes from Alex Foray at Exane BNP Paribas. Alex, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question. Alex, can you hear us?
Alex Faure
Analyst
0:23:40
Hey, can you hear me now?
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:23:41
Yes, we can.
Alex Faure
Analyst
0:23:44
Thanks for letting me on. A couple of questions, maybe. As we go into the CMD, I just wanted to sort of look back to what you guided to in November 2023 and sort of this acceleration in the high 20% you're expecting for 2026. You're now guiding more to, I don't know, low to mid-20%. I know you called out some tariff impact, obviously, but you also helped us size that impact. It doesn't quite take us to high 20%. What do you think didn't go according to plan to get to a high 20% in 2026 eventually? That'd be my first question. Second question is going back to the agentic commerce discussion. I heard what you say in part of engaging with other industry leaders in OpenAI and Google and so on.
Alex Faure
Analyst
0:24:42
When you look at all the different protocols and frameworks that have been issued so far this year, and you think of the work it requires on Adyen's side to integrate with some of those, does it sound like significant work? Is it a matter of weeks, a matter of months, a matter of quarters? How should we think of that? Thank you so much.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:25:05
Yeah, sure. I think if you think back to November 2023, as you mentioned, we were giving a three-year view. We wanted to share a wider range at that time, given that we were giving a longer timeframe. We were talking about that three-year view, and a lot of things happened over multiple years to understand what your growth looks like in any given year. Even the priorities of your own customers, what is in play in one year may look different than what's in play in the next year, and that's just based on their roadmaps, their own prioritization. We're always looking to help our customers where they have the pain points, where they are focused, and that can look different in any given year. I wouldn't necessarily frame it in the sense of like, hey, what went wrong or what went differently.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:25:55
I would mostly frame it in as we get closer towards this 2026 year, towards the end of this kind of guidance timeframe, and that gives us more visibility, and that more visibility is what we are trying to share here by refining the financial objective. To your second question on agentic commerce, it is not real significant work for us to implement it, and I think that's the benefit of building everything on our single platform and taking that end-to-end ownership. We have so many of the building blocks which are going to be required in this new agentic world, and that positions us really well to be able to move quickly. I think in large part we have a lot of the building blocks which will be at play here.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:26:45
It's much more about figuring out the solution which truly will help merchants and allow them to have the right experience and the consumers to have the right experience. Of course, there's going to be some work that goes into it, but that's not the biggest piece. I think we largely have the building blocks in play, which is a great position to be in.

Great. Thanks for your questions, Alex. The next question comes from Pavan Daswani from Citi. Pavan, please go ahead and ask your question.
Pavan Daswani
Technology Software and Fintech Equity Analyst
0:27:16
Hello, can you hear me?
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:27:17
Yep, we can hear you.
Pavan Daswani
Technology Software and Fintech Equity Analyst
0:27:18
Perfect. Thanks, Ethan. Thanks, Maggie. My question would be on the de minimis tariff impact and the previously guided 2% drag in H2. Could you maybe give us an update of how did that trend in Q3 for the online APAC headquartered merchants? Was there any incremental disruption in late August with the de minimis expansion?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:27:39
For the subset of customers that we talked about in the first half, we saw slight improvement during the quarter. Also, keep in mind that in the first half, this was largely an impact that we saw at the end of that first half. We did see some slight improvement throughout the quarter, but nothing that really meaningfully changed our results. That's worth commenting on. In terms of other impacted merchants also beyond it, we haven't seen material or meaningful movements related to this throughout the course of the third quarter.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager

Great. Thanks for your question, Pavan. The next question comes from Sven Mert at Barclays. Sven, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Sven Merkt
Assistant VP and Equity Analyst
0:28:23
Perfect. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Can you give us maybe a bit more detail on the point of sales volumes growth? It slowed sequentially in both Unified Commerce and platforms. Can you just comment what is the driver here, especially as you called out that there's been an increased migration from digital to Unified Commerce? Thank you.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:28:47
Yeah, there's nothing specific that I would call out related to this. I think in any given period, it is a short-term period. You do see different volumes moving between pillars, but also between the sales channel, also between regions, right? I wouldn't focus too much on a single quarter results. I think in general, what we've seen is strong growth across each of our pillars, across each of our regions. It is quite a diversified mix, which is driving the growth that we see in the third quarter. For me, that's the strength of the position that we're in.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:29:30
Thanks for your question, Sven. The next question comes from Sandeep Deshpande from J.P. Morgan. Sandeep, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Sandeep Deshpande
Equity Research Analyst
0:29:38
Yeah, hi, thanks. I have two quick questions on your revenue line. I mean, you've got some new initiatives like issuing as well as lending, etc. Where are we at this point? Has anything changed in the third quarter in terms of, you know, progress on these pillars, these next generation pillars that you are working on? Secondly, looking into 2026, I mean, in the past, Adyen would announce some big new customers and they would have a significant impact on your sales growth in future years. With your TPV now so much bigger than it was in the past, are there any customers that are targeted and can make a big difference to Adyen in 2026 or beyond? Are we now at the point that most of your growth, more and more of your growth is going to come from existing footprint gains and existing customers?
Sandeep Deshpande
Equity Research Analyst
0:30:25
Clearly, this is something that you will probably talk at the Capital Markets Day, but is that where we are going towards as such?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:30:32
Yeah, so let's start with embedded financial products. Of course, it's a topic we will cover in more detail at Investor Day, but in relation to Q3, I think we still see strong traction in issuing. That's one that we talked about also in H1. I think in general, the way to think about embedded financial products is that it's a really important piece of the products we deliver, especially to our platform customers. It's a big reason why we're able to grow the platform's pillar in the way that we have been at that 50% or so level that we saw in Q3 as well. In terms of if there are still big customers to win, which ultimately will drive our growth, I think there's a couple of points I'd make.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:31:16
One is, I've said it a few times on the call, but we are getting more and more diversified. There are more and more customers on the platform which are helping to drive our growth. I don't look at it necessarily on an individual customer by individual customer basis. If you again compare it or take a look at the 2025 cohort we're seeing on the new sales side, so again, completely new businesses to the Adyen platform, we're seeing that scale up quite nicely. There still is a lot of potential for us to add new business to new customers to our platform. We're very much focused on still driving that because while it has little impact in any given year you add them, it does drive your growth over future years.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:31:58
It's very much also a signal to our positioning in the market, the strength of the differentiation we have. It's, of course, something we spend a lot of time on and that we see strength in today.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:32:10
Great. Thanks for your question. The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sanjay, please go ahead and ask your question.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:32:19
Thank you. I wanted to ask the 2026 question a little bit differently. I guess when we think about that range that you guys have provided, how have you built that range up? When we think about some of the variables that could land you within that range, bottom or lower, what are they? As discussed earlier, you've had some puts and takes over the guidance period that you provided before. Thanks, Ethan.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:32:47
Yeah, the biggest driver of our growth for 2026 is going to be the existing customer base. The two biggest factors are how fast they grow and how much share of wallet we gain in that year. Now we're starting to get some better insight into the specific opportunities that we see with our customer base for 2026 as they go through their own planning process, their own prioritization exercise, and they talk through what types of opportunities they'll be focused on. We also start to get better insights into how they think about their own growth for next year as well. Ultimately, those are going to be the two biggest factors that will drive our growth.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:33:26
While we're not at the point that we have full visibility with them because we're still going through that exercise, we did feel like it was helpful to refine again the range at which we see 2026 playing out. I think if you look at that range, you see that we'll be in a position to gain significant market share also through the course of next year. We're well positioned to be able to gain much more share of wallet with our customer base. I think that ultimately is the strength of the differentiation that we have and that we're bringing to market.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:34:01
Great. Thanks for your question. The next question comes from Brian Dammeir at TD Cowen. Brian, please go ahead and ask your question.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:34:10
Thank you. A bit of a follow-up there on wallet share. Can you share updated views on your wallet share penetration across certain client cohorts that you've talked about in the past, the runway for further penetration in that wallet share? Does macro volatility enable situations where you can actually pursue and win greater wallet share in certain types of clients?
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:34:31
Yeah, so of course this is part of what we addressed at the Investor Day a couple of years ago, thinking about where we are per pillar by wallet share. I think the reality is that we're still very much in the same position, that we still have most of the wallet share still to win with our existing base. Now that's not true for every customer. There are customers we do 100% or the vast majority of payments for them. If you look at our platform overall, especially because we've been continuously adding new customers to the platform over past years, we're still in the position where the majority of volumes within our customer base is to win. That's what we're very much focused on.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:35:20
Thanks for your question. The next question comes from Fahed Khanwar at Redburn. Fahed, please go ahead and unmute yourself and ask your question.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:35:29
Maggie O'Donnell, hi Ethan. Just a quick question on digital specifically. I thought the acceleration or the inflection in digital was quite interesting. We've had a couple of quarters where you've disclosed net revenues where it's been decelerating. I appreciate there's been some noise, but it does feel like, you know, we had kind of that 7% number last quarter, probably 9%, 10% ex de minimis and leap year and FXRA. We've probably jumped up to kind of 12%, 13% now. Could I understand, and that 12%, 13% is with volume boom digital to Unified Commerce, so really, really strong performance. Could I just understand what's been happening in digital? Like why has it inflected as much as it has? Going forward, can we expect further acceleration in digital revenues?
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:36:15
My understanding is Unified Commerce and platform partners is probably where all the juice is coming from, but any color on that would be great. Thank you.
Ethan Tandowsky
CFO
0:36:23
Yeah, I would just say that we remain really, really focused on winning in digital. It's the biggest part of our volumes. It's the biggest part of our customer base. A lot of the products that we've been rolling out have a huge impact on digital customers, right? Think about the Uplift suite, this combination of authorization and payments costs and fraud. That's really, really prevalent in the digital pillar. I think our global capabilities, our abilities to work with the largest enterprise and really optimize for their payments needs is the thing that's been really important to differentiating ourselves. Now that's always been the case, but rolling out products like Uplift helps us ensure that we continue to stay differentiated, that we can continue to help our customer base. That's ultimately where you see us continuing to gain share.
Maggie O'Donnell
Investor Relations Manager
0:37:15
Thanks for your question. The last question. Oh, I guess that is the last question. Thank you guys so much for joining us today. We appreciate you taking the time. For any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the IR team. Have a great day.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to TotalEnergies' third quarter 2025 results conference call. I now hand over to Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO, and Jean-Pierre Sbraire, CFO, who will lead you through the call. Sir, please go ahead.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:04:40
Good afternoon. Good morning everyone. Before Jean-Pierre goes through the details of the third quarter results, I would like to make a few opening comments. Almost exactly one month ago we updated you with our strategy during our capital markets day in New York and we had four key consistency and resilience of our two pillar strategy, strong and secured production growth in our oil and gas business, accretive cash flow generation and capital discipline. I believe that this company has strong third quarter results. Again, Jean-Pierre will detail with you perfectly illustrates these key catalysts and highlights the value proposition of a consistent and profitable growth model. Strategy is clearly in motion and is translating into more cash flow even in a more challenging environment.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:05:38
Indeed, despite oil pricing dropping by more than $10 per barrel year on year, the cash flow for the third quarter increased by 4% and adjusted net income for the third quarter held steadily. Why? Primarily for two reasons. First, the hydrocarbon production growth is a reality and is highly accretive. The new project barrels coming online such as Mero fields in Brazil, deepwater projects in the U.S., offshore Gulf for oil, Tura and Phoenix for gas have an average cash flow margin which is roughly twice higher than the base portfolio. They have contributed 170,000 barrels per day during the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. These new barrels have generated around $400 million of additional cash flow year on year.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:06:33
Growth volume around $200 million and higher margin another $200 million and they contributed to absorb the equivalent of $6 per barrel of decrease in the Brent in terms of cash flow. I think the strong demonstration that our disciplined investment framework that includes strict sanctioning criteria, less than $20 per barrel technical cost of $30 per barrel breakeven for E&P projects is delivering its fruits and we expect, of course, that this cash flow tailoring from new high margin barrels will continue as we work our way through our deep project queue. As a reminder, starting from 2025, continuing in 2026, the company is growing upstream production by 3% per year for 2030.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:07:27
What is the differentiation factor that stands out of our business model is clearly that more than 95% of this production by 2030 is already either online or under construction, and largely under lump sum EPC contracts, which significantly derisks the cost. Projects are in hand and we are executing them. Again, 2023 this year and this last quarter demonstrate that we are well in the delivery mode. Some people think we are borrowing, but we are borrowing for the good. Cash is growing. The second pillar of these good results has been the recovery of the downstream, which contributes to the company's resiliency, with cash flow up by almost $500 million. It is true that the refining margin was better, which is also true, but we managed to capture them thanks to a good availability of our assets.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:08:30
In particular, there were several turnarounds during the quarter, but they were executed in time, on schedule, and on budget. It allows us to reach our objective. Of course, Marketing and Services continue to deliver consistent results and demonstrate that the priority given to value-over-volume in this segment is the right approach. In addition to highlighting the strength of our consistent strategy, this third quarter demonstrates as well that we are delivering in the short term, specifically on the second half 2025 plan that we laid out during the July earnings call, which included four key elements. Again, the accretive production growth, giving more cash flows, a downward inflection in our net investments, coming back to the capital discipline, which decreased by $3.5 billion quarter over quarter, a reversal of the seasonal working capital, as we have released this quarter of $1.3 billion.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:09:34
Lastly, all these elements improve the gearing that is now close to 17% compared to next to 18%. The end result is that during the third quarter, at $69 per barrel, the company generated excess free cash flow, with cash flow including working capital variation more than covering net investment, plus $4.5 billion of shareholder returns in the form of dividends and buyback. This leads me to shareholder returns. The company, of course, continues its strong track record of dividend growth. The Board of Directors decided to increase the third interim dividend by close to 8% in euro and more than 10% in dollars compared to 2024. On the buyback side, as announced on September 24, the Board of Directors authorized up to $1.5 billion of share buyback for the fourth quarter 2025 and therefore, assuming annual cash flow between $27.5 billion and $28 billion.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:10:39
In particular, supported by the better refining margin that we observe currently, the 2025 payout ratio is expected to remain around 56%. Looking forward, we expect to maintain a strong momentum for the fourth quarter. Upstream production is anticipated to grow more than 4% year on year. Like this quarter, the net investments are expected to decrease quarter over quarter, in particular because we will deliver the disposal proceeds, $2 billion expected, and at the end the net of acquisitions will represent $1.5 billion of cash inflow in the balance sheet, with another anticipated positive contribution from the seasonal working capital. We anticipate to continue to strengthen the balance sheet with gearing forecasted February 30th to decline to 15% to 16% at year end. Last but not least, the Board of Directors has approved the roadmap to transform our ADRs into ordinary shares.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:11:52
We're happy to announce that we ordered today J.P. Morgan to launch the termination process of the ADR program, with the objective that ordinary shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange from December 8th. This is of course an important milestone for the company as it will allow for a single class of TotalEnergies shares to trade with extended hours. It will be essentially a continuous listing from Paris 9:00 A.M. to New York 4:00 P.M., 10:00 P.M. Paris time. We hope that these ordinary shares listing will be a clear catalyst for the stock in 2026 in both Paris and New York markets. We intend to market these ordinary shares on the U.S. market even more actively than today. I will now turn the call over to Jean-Pierre, who will go through the details of these first quarter financials.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:12:46
Thank you, Patrick. I will start by commenting on the price environment in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Brent averaged $59 per barrel during the third quarter versus $68 per barrel in the second quarter, up 2% but down more than $10 per barrel compared to the third quarter. 2024 ETF averaged $11.3 per million versus $11.9 per MMBtu, down 5%, and the average LNG price decreased to $8.9 per million BTU versus $9.1 per million BTU, down 2%. On the other side, for refining, the European refining margin significantly improved to $63 per tonne compared to $35 per tonne during the second quarter, up close to 80%.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:13:43
In this price environment, the company reported strong financial results with third quarter 2025 cash flow increasing by 7% compared to the second quarter, adjusted net income increasing by 11%, thanks to the continued positive impact of the new attractive upstream barriers and strong downstream results that reflect the company's ability to capture higher refining margins in Europe. Overall profitability remains strong with return on equity for the 12 months ending September 30th at 14.2% and ROE close to 12.5%. Moving now to the business segments, starting with hydrocarbons on a year-on-year basis, first quarter hydrocarbons production exceeded expectations and increased by more than 4%, making it the company's highest growth quarter so far this year. We anticipate that this trend will continue with fourth quarter hydrocarbon production expected to grow more than 4% compared to 4Q2024, notably benefiting from the restart of Ichthys LNG in Australia.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:15:00
Turning to the quarterly results and starting with exploration and production, this segment generated during 3Q2025 an adjusted net income of $2.2 billion, up 10% quarter over quarter in a similar price environment and outpacing quarter over quarter E&P production growth of around 4%. Similarly, cash flow growth was strong at $4 billion, up 6% quarter over quarter. Importantly, our project portfolio is delivering new low-cost, low-emission oil and gas production that is accretive with an average upstream CFPO per barrel that is roughly two times the base portfolio. Regarding an E&P project, we are progressing on all fronts. On the project side, we achieved first oil at the Begonia and closed phase three offshore fields in Angola, and we sanctioned phase two of the redevelopment of the Ratawi oil field in Iraq, which is part of the GGIP projects.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:16:07
As we have now launched all phases of DDIP, we are looking forward to the first oil for phase one of the redevelopment early 2026 at M&A. The company is consistently high grading its portfolio. During the last earnings call we mentioned that we are expecting several E&P divestments in the second half of the year. During the third quarter we divested two unconditional blocks in Vaca Muerta in Argentina, which closed this quarter, and three satellite fields on Ekofisk in Norway, out of our strict investment criteria, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Lastly, on exploration, we continue to reload the hopper to complement existing opportunities, and this quarter we announced new license awards in Algeria, in the Republic of the Congo, and in Liberia.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:16:58
Moving to integrated LNG, third quarter LNG sales of 10.4 million tonnes were essentially flat quarter over quarter as third party purchases offset lower sales from equity production. Cash flow of $1.1 billion was in line with the second quarter in a stable price environment with an average energy price of around $9. Adjusted net operating income of $0.9 billion was down 18% quarter over quarter, primarily due to the planned turnarounds at Ichthys LNG in Australia that impacted production by around 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. On the price outlook forward, European gas prices continue to be sustained at around $11 per MMBtu for 1Q2025 and winter 2025-2026 due to anticipated winter demand.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:18:02
Given the evolution of oil and gas prices in recent months and the lag effect on pricing formulas, the company anticipates an average energy selling price of around $8.50 per MMBtu for the first quarter 2025. On the adjustment of our LNG strategy, we are pleased to continue to grow our U.S. presence with the recent FID on Rio Grande LNG in 2024 in South Texas, and we enhanced resilience in our LNG and gas to power strategy by acquiring interest in shale gas assets from Continental Resources in the Anadarko Basin in the U.S. Turning to integrated power, net power generation increased 9% quarter over quarter to 12.6 TWh due to increased outputs from flexible generation capacity in Europe. The value of TotalEnergies' unique integrated model is illustrated in the third quarter financials.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:19:05
Total cash flow from operations was $0.6 billion, up 9% quarter over quarter and in line with annual guidance. To provide more granularity in the integrated power financial performance. This quarter we disclosed the split in cash flow between production assets, renewable and gas-fired power plants on one side and sales activity B2B, B2C, and trading on the other side, showing that each contributed equally this quarter during Q3, Q4. During the third quarter the company has executed well on the downside of the integrated power business model which contributes capital recycling and will generate a tailwind for free cash flow in the fourth quarter. The company signed an agreement for the sale of 50% of the 1.4 GW renewable portfolio in North America and closed the sale of 50% of a 270 megawatt renewable portfolio in France.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:20:12
These deals have a combined cash impact of around $1.5 billion and in this deal TotalEnergies retains a 50% stake in the assets and will continue to be the operator after closing and to offset 100% of the electrons. This is in line with our business model. As an important reminder, our effective upstream growth is not the only contributor to the company's resilience. Integrated power will take a key role in this too since it is a different city than growing cash flow stream that is outside of crude cycles and with strong demand fundamentals. Moving to downstream, as Patrick mentioned, during the third quarter downstream efficiently captured the high refining margins in Europe and contributed to the company resilient financials. Third quarter adjusted net operating income of $1.1 billion was up more than 30% quarter over quarter.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:21:15
Cash flow of $1.7 billion was up 11% quarter over quarter thanks to good availability of assets that allowed us to successfully capture improved European margins. In terms of free cash flow, during the third quarter downstream cash flow from operating activities exceeded net investment by over $2.5 billion in refining. The European refining margin marker strengthened during the third quarter due to the tension on the diesel supply chain. In the context of low inventories, utilization was 84% which was towards the high end of the guidance range of 80 to 85% and it reflects efficient operations and planned turnarounds at Port Arthur in the U.S. and HTC in Korea. In marketing and services, results remain consistently strong with high margin activities offsetting lower volumes. Looking ahead, we anticipate refined utilization of 80 to 84% in the fourth quarter which accounts for scheduled turnarounds at Antwerp and Satorp.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:22:31
Moving now to the company level and starting with working capital, as expected, we benefited from the working cap release during the third quarter, which was a $1.3 billion positive contribution to cash. Furthermore, for the fourth quarter, we anticipate another positive contribution on net investments. They meaningfully decreased to $3.1 billion in the first quarter, which includes $0.4 billion of divestment net of acquisitions in the fourth quarter. As mentioned by Patrick, disposals are estimated to total $2 billion, including the closing of Nigeria and Norway divestment for exploration and production, as well as spend down of renewable assets in North America and Greece for integrated power, and we reiterate full year 2025 net investment guidance of $17 to $17.5 billion.
Jean-Pierre Sbraire
CFO
0:23:33
Based on anticipated net investments and working cap, we expect gearing to decrease to 15 to 16% at year end compared to 17.3% at the end of the third quarter. With that, Patrick and I are now available to answer your question and the operator, so please open up the line for questions.

Thank you and good afternoon to both of you, and thank you for the presentation. Two questions, if I could. The first one, can I just get your clarification on where we are on the tax issues in France? I've seen headlines this morning about tax on share buybacks, what that actually means. The second one, I think, Patrick, this comes back to your point around the growth in production is obviously doing quite well, but also the growth in cash flow numbers. When you're thinking about 2026, can you give us an indication as to how much more cash flow might grow than production for next year? Just remind us of that.
Lydia Rainforth
Managing Director
0:25:05
Thank you.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:25:07
Okay. Good morning. Good afternoon, Lydia. First, as you observe, there is quite a huge or quite a big fiscal creativity in the French Parliament these last days. Clearly, the full recipe will not work. We don't know. Be careful not to overreact to the night news. There was a super tax on multinationals which is completely out of the rule of law. France has signed 125 fiscal agreements with many countries. The principle is no double taxation, and this is very anchored. As the government reminded the parliament, this is the right rule, so we will not be touched by that. There is also in the constitution some already decision, and when you want to tax above what is reasonable, then these types of taxations are not approved or are cancelled. Honestly, the political situation in France is not very stable.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:26:16
There is a huge debate making a lot of noise. I trust that at the end of the day we'll land to a reasonable avenue. As you all know as well, we, TotalEnergies, do not make a lot of benefit in France. I would say we'll follow this debate. Again, I'm comfortable with the fact that at the end of the day, government will take the right decisions to maintain, in fact, which is fundamental, what we call the supply policy. If you want, before you redistribute in a country, you need to create wealth, you need to produce, you need to create results, revenues, and then you can speak about distribution, and we will come back to that. I understand that, and I think, by the way, that this situation in France is weighing on the share price of TotalEnergies.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:27:11
I remind you as well that we are a global company and that, again, largely 90%, 95%, I think, of our cash flows and our results are not coming from our country where we have the headquarters. From this perspective, the profile of TotalEnergies is quite different from other French companies, and the market should integrate it for 2026. Honestly, Lydia, you are asking me a question to which I will answer more precisely in February. As we know, we have a meeting for annual results and what is the plan for 2026. As I told you in New York, we anticipate a growth of 3%, more than 3% for 2026. Again, for the cash flows, I don't have all figures. Of course, it's related to the new production coming on stream.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:28:05
Part of the, I would say, new production of 2025, like the Brazilian production, will have the full effect in 2026. I anticipate another accretive effect on our accretive effect, the size of it. You have to be a little patient. Again, clearly we are in a delivery mode. We deliver the production growth more than 3, then this year probably will be next to 4. In fact, at the end of the year, other than 3, 3.5 to 4 for 2025 next year, at least 3. Let's deliver the accretive cash. This is a roadmap, not only 2025, 2026 for the next five years. As we reminded you, and we, I think, gave you comfort during the New York presentation that we will deliver this $10 billion of additional free cash from all our segments in the next five years.

The next question is Michele Delavina, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michele Della Vigna
Managing Director
0:29:14
Thank you and congratulations on the strong growth. Two questions, if I may. First, I was wondering if you feel like you're able at the moment to capture the extraordinary refining margins we're seeing, and how the improvements to your Port Arthur and Donges refineries are progressing. Secondly, I was just wondering what you're seeing in terms of disruptions of the Russian volumes following the latest sanctions, and if you start to see an impact on the physical market through your trading and optimization divisions. Thank you.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:29:46
Thank you for this question, Michele. To be honest, when I read again our press release, I think we are a little bearish on the oil price and the refining margins. The refining margins as we captured since the beginning of October for the last month is around $75 per ton. When we guided you at above $50, I think we are a little shy. In fact, it's fundamentally linked because we begin to see real impact in the market of these last Russian sanctions. I think the market is underestimating what it means when you have U.S. sanctions. Two large Russian companies, which are the core of trading Russian oil, by the way. When Europe said that we are targeting countries which are considered, I would say, dangerous, like India, Turkey, and China. If you trade oil or products from these countries, you could be under sanction.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:30:38
The reaction today in the market, and I shared some views with some of my colleagues, including I was in Riyadh last two days. Clearly, today trading houses as well are more cautious. We see that everybody is taking these, including secondary sanctions, you know, which might become. I see some impact. I think the refining margins today is more around $100 per ton than the $75 on average. It is linked clearly to, in fact, this sanction will oblige to reroute some volumes and to find a way to bring, I would say, products and crude oil more expensively to the different locations of the planet. I think this is clear. That also could have an impact, by the way, on the oil price. I mean the crude oil price. We've seen a reaction. Whatever announced today is still $65.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:31:40
$65 I think is a good assumption for this quarter. Maybe a little more. I would say more bullish. That's what we wrote a few days ago because I begin to realize that these sanctions will have a real impact in this market. Most of the players are becoming, are taking them. You speak, which is good, by the way. TotalEnergies, you know, we stopped trading any Russian oil since the end of 2022 somewhere. We penalize ourselves compared to other practice. I think it was the right way to comply and to be strict on the Russian sanctions. Capturing the refining margins is for sure. The good news of third quarter is that we managed to do it. We had a turnaround on Port Harper, which is down. It's fully back online now. Donges as well is running.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:32:28
Not fully, not the last equipment we are waiting for by the end of the year, but it's running. We deliver results. In the third quarter and fourth quarter, we have two turnarounds, one in Antwerp, one in Sator, which are two big machines in our results. I expect that this will be, I would say, compensated again by the other assets and by the fact that the margins are higher. I'm positive. When I gave you a guidance of $27.5 for $28, I was maybe too bearish by stating $27 in New York. It's because as well I integrate these elements, which again, the duty and all the organization of refining chemicals are dedicated to capture these margins, which are good. This is where we are, and I'm bullish on that.

Doug Leggate

Thank you.
Doug Leggate
Senior Research Analyst
0:33:37
Good morning, Patrick and Jean-Pierre.
Doug Leggate
Senior Research Analyst
0:33:41
I wonder if I could start with your upstream margin. The volume guidance is again pretty strong for Q4, but I guess what we're observing is that your upstream margin seems to be moving up as well as the volumes. I'm trying to understand what happens as the mix changes going forward. For example, Iraq never historically had great margins. How do you see the margin mix continuing as the growth trajectory sustains?
Doug Leggate
Senior Research Analyst
0:34:12
Over the next several years? That's my first question.
Doug Leggate
Senior Research Analyst
0:34:15
My second question, if I may, is a quick one. Oil appears still to be in a very technical market. We all see the oversupply, but it seems to keep bouncing around that $60 level.
Doug Leggate
Senior Research Analyst
0:34:27
I guess my question is, if you Ended up with better cash flow than you thought when you reset the buyback, what would be the first call on cash?
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:34:37
Would it go to the balance sheet?
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:34:39
To continue the deleveraging, or would it go to the higher end of the buybacks? Thank you.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:34:45
The second question is clear, it will go to the balance sheet. Thank you. The second answer I would say is clear, we go to balance sheet. We'll go to the balance sheet. I observed that and I spent quite a lot of time with investors in the last month and clearly, or I would say long term investor day, branching branches is important for all of us. If you want to be, the best buyback policy would be to become, to become cyclical, you need to have a strong balance sheet. That's a position I would take and keep. Consider the guidance we gave you. We gave you quite a good guidance and we told you $0.75 to $1.5 between $60 and $72 billion $80. I'm answering for 2026.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:35:36
To be clear, if we continue and we see the plan to deliver more and more free cash on the roadmap to $10 billion, we might revisit this scheme. Today in 2026, if it's coming, in your case, if we are above $16, 2026 or above $70, we will continue to deleverage upstream margins. No, Iraq is a good contract. I know it's likely but it's not at all the case, you know, as we always, I mean as I told you, we are far away from the historical service contract we have. When we came back in Iraq it was clear that either we had a good contract, a strong contract. It was a matter of risk and reward, you know, and risk and reward. In particular the Iraqi contract is quite reactive to the oil price. We capture some upside on it, which of course is important.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:36:29
We benefit in Iraq from quite a low cost production. The break even is low and it will contribute. The Iraqi barrels, don't make a mistake, are contributing to the increase, are accretive. Again, I can give you, but I think we gave you in the end in New York. In fact, the base barrels had an average around $19 to $20 per barrel. Today these new barrels are more between $30 and $40 per barrel. It's why we have an attractive growth in upstream.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:37:04
So.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:37:06
I think you will continue to see again the free cash flow from upstream will move quicker than the growth of production.

Biraj Borkhataria
Equity Research Associate
0:37:29
Hi, thanks for taking my question. Firstly, nice to see that production growth being the accretion coming through that really is a differentiator. Two questions. The first one is on the divestments for the year. I know you mentioned Nigeria. In the $2 billion, I believe there were two deals that you're planning to do, one of which wasn't approved. Could you just outline whether the.
Biraj Borkhataria
Equity Research Associate
0:37:55
That sale was in.
Biraj Borkhataria
Equity Research Associate
0:37:57
The $2 billion, or is that on top of the $2 billion? Secondly, recently you signed a letter with a number of other CEOs around European competitiveness. I was just wondering if you could.
Biraj Borkhataria

0:38:09

Biraj Borkhataria

Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:38:18
What is the second question? Sorry, I didn't catch it. Okay, I understood. I know. Okay, I know, I know, I know. Okay, understood. You open competitiveness later. Okay. First on divestments, I will be very precise with you. The $2 billion. I will give you where it's coming from. We intend to close and we have already closed some of them, but we are intending to close and all I think we have signed and we are in the process and it's a matter of closure. The Bunga divestment in Nigeria, Norway, the satellite Eco fiscal renewable assets in the U.S., renewable assets which will be announced in Greece.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:39:04
As well, we have another project where we will, but I cannot yet disclose to you guys, another $300 million which will be announced soon. So it's a $2 billion that does not include, to be precise, SPDCV divestment, not only because we, but because we, in fact, we were not able to close. There were some conditions precedent on our side. We consider that it was not reasonable to close with, I would say, the supposed buyer. We are discussing today, we have advanced discussion with two additional, two new buyers which are, I think, serious ones. We will not be able to be clear to answer your question, to close it before this quarter. It's for next year, by the way. It's good because it's part of the plan for next year.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:39:56
From this perspective, you know, what we have observed is that divestments of E and P assets generally take time. It takes more time, even if we have demonstrated with our divestment in Argentina that we were able to sign and to close in the same quarter. Sometimes it's going quicker. The plan is very clear and we have some interested buyers and serious buyers on it. We are working on this one. There are others, like I mentioned to you, other ideas for this year and next year that I mentioned in New York on which we work as well. On the European Competition letter, the answer, you probably follow that, some tweets or LinkedIn. European leaders are not really, I mean, are listening to our request.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:40:45
They have been, I would say, we had some calls with some discussions with some European commissioners who took the letter C from 40 CEOs to say, look, so they understood, they think we are maybe asking them too much. I think it's sort of a wake up call from these 40 CEOs. We, myself and the Siemens CEO, we are the spokesperson. Let's be clear. We were just reflecting what people expressed during our meetings between French and German CEOs. I've seen that on some topics which are, I would say, giving some more polemics, there had been some calls that were not only from European CEOs but from U.S. Energy Secretary and Qatar Energy Minister to call to revisit some of this legislation which seems to be in fact against competitiveness and again for some of them putting at stake the security of supply of Europe.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:41:44
I think this is something which is serious and we are European CEOs and we of course want to continue to contribute to Europe development and growth, but to do it, I think it's also our job to speak up when we consider that conditions are changing and it might be difficult for us to contribute to European prosperity. It's a moving, you know, it's a continuous, would say fight, but let's contribute to it.

Yeah, hi.
Martijn Rats
Managing Director of Equity Research
0:42:24
Hello.
Martijn Rats
Managing Director of Equity Research
0:42:25
I've got two FMA. First of all, what I thought has been really surprising this year is the strength of new LNG FIDs. Already a year, year and a half ago, many of us were writing reports about the surplus in the LNG market in the second half of the decade. Yet 2025 has been a near record year of new energy capacity to be commissioned and TotalEnergies still has a few projects it needs to decide on. I was wondering if you perhaps could share with us your thoughts on, despite the outlook, the number of new FIDs being as strong as they are, and also how it impacts your own decisions in terms of future LNG FIDs. The second one I wanted to ask is about the shares and the equivalence between sort of the Paris share and sort of U.S.
Martijn Rats
Managing Director of Equity Research
0:43:17
shares and consolidating this into one single class of shares. I was wondering if this could impact the execution of your buyback program in the sense that I was wondering if this is in place from December 8 onwards, as I now understand it, if some of the buyback program could be executed in sort of New York Stock Exchange listed shares. Of course, the context behind the question is then also if that could then be a way to avoid some of the proposals that have creatively been floated, as I think you put it, in French Parliament over the last couple of days.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:43:54
Okay, the second question on ADR, no, it does not impact at all the execution of the buyback program. I remind you that the ADR conversion is about around 9, 10% of our shares. Obviously, the buyback program will be executed on the Paris stock market, to be clear, and not on the New York listed because it would be strange for us to buy back from New York where we want, on the contrary, to give more life to this New York market. I prefer more activity and finding more. We will buy back shares in New York when we see we'll have much more shares on this side of the Atlantic. I would say the first point, and honestly, no, it will not, by the way, it will not avoid in any way tax proposals. Again, the tax proposals are funny proposals.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:44:41
There are some principles, you know, when President Hollande tried to impose, by the way, he tried to impose 3% tax, extra tax on dividends, which was canceled by the European Union and by the French Constitutional Court. All of us have the coupon money they took during three, four years. There are some principles. We are in a rule of law continent and a rule of law country. This is a reality. You must make a split between the political debates, which are quite vigorous, I would say, and eventually creative, and the reality of the rule of law. We know that there is some limit. When I see the figures, and I will tell you what I'm thinking, the higher it is, the better it is because then I'm sure it will not go through the system. That's the reality.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:45:29
In the French constitution, you cannot deprive people unreasonably to their profits and their results. Buybacks are not at all a profit, you know, buyback, it's just a matter of distribution and by the way of investment in the company, we invest in the company. I'm ready again, I think it's a topic on which I'm ready to continue to explain to Parliament members what are buybacks. I think we'll again, don't overreact to this type of news. I'm afraid we'll have over news during the next 30 days coming from the Parliament. At the end of the day, I trust the government FIDs. Sorry, FIDs. I'm not sure, I mean there has been a lot of announcements, I'm not sure. How many FIDs exactly?
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:46:28
Because between the announcements, you have a flow of news of projects being revised because they get the permitting or they get the approval for non-FDA countries export from the U.S. administration. You have a new flow coming, then FID. I know train 4 and 5 in next decade. Yes, I know them. I know that one or two competitors are serious and are progressing because as I said in the year, all these projects need to find the financing, to find the financing. Again, an acceptable good financing, a good financing, not an expensive one. Otherwise, you destroy the value. On train 4, we managed to put in place a project financing of Rio Grande 4 around 6.5% which was good project financing, which helped the leverage on it. Other projects do not have the same godfathers, I would say, as Rio Grande and Rio Grande LNG.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:47:27
Of course, I agree that we need to take that into consideration. You know, we have a strong policy, a clear view. We decided to transfer most of our exposure on the GKM, I would say, LNG spot market to the Brent formulas and we have been active. I think we are very right to do it. I'm more bullish on the oil price as I explained, but on this one by the end of the decade, we need to assess and to take into account that we postponed Cameron 24 because the CapEx was too high. It's not the time to run again on Cameron 24. The other decision we have in our portfolio is path one.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:48:06
Eugenia, you know that we are working on the CapEx to lower the CapEx and it's clear that lowering the CapEx is of utmost importance in a market which could be from this perspective weaker when we launch a project. That's a topic on which we will have to work and we have demonstrated already, but we know how to be disciplined in that market, giving priority to, I would say, first and second quartile projects in our portfolio and that's an element which will have to be taken into consideration. By the way, we have announced that we'll lift it. The fourth measure on Mozambique, there is a funny figure which is in some press news agencies which speak about $25 billion. We are not at all, and I want to be clear and strong on this news. I don't know, people are playing games which is not acceptable.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:48:59
They have access to, some people have relinquished a letter that I sent to the President of Mozambique. It's clear, it's written $20 billion in the letter, out of which $4.5 billion came from what we spent in the last four years. The budget when we left in 2021 was around, it was a group $15 billion, you add $4.5, you are down to $20, $20.5 billion. That's the reality of this budget. By the way, this cost, very old cost, you know what we've done is that we spent, we've done all the detailed engineering and all the procurement has been done. Today, as soon as we fully re-mobilize everybody, we are purely in a construction mode and that's why we said we are able to deliver the project by 2029.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:49:52
I've discovered something, some people were surprised, but in fact we spent some money in order to, I would say, recapture part of the time which was under force measures. The budget is not a total $25 and I want to be strong. It's $20, $20.5 billion as we will restart. Again, I can confirm it because we had long discussions of course with contractors. We have put all these figures together with them and including on the delivery in 2029, we have strong commitment so we have realigned the whole system in order to be able to execute properly this project.

The next question is from Akim at HSBC. Please go ahead.
Operator
0:50:46
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of weeks ago at an industry conference you mentioned that the LNG market is getting more competitive and it's harder to make money in trading. I guess that's not exactly a secret, but I was wondering if you could provide any more color on this. I was wondering how much of the decline in LNG trading profits would you ascribe to heightened competition versus the more normalized conditions, you know, lower volatility, lower spreads, etc. I also wanted to come back to the EU sustainability rules. I suppose let's see if the EU rules could be amended, but if they broadly stick, how would you ensure compliance with the CSDD rules in practice? Hypothetically, what would be your options if some LNG supply is deemed to be non-compliant, would you be able to redirect it? Thank you.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:51:36
Okay, first question. To be clear, I think we made a demonstration in New York. The message is not that we have a decline of energy trading. We told you that there are exceptional trading profits from 2021, 2022, 2023 and that we are back to a normal environment with lower volatility. By the way, the results of 2025 on integrated LNG are in line with 2024. I'm just saying that we don't benefit from the growth on this part at this stage. Later we'll have a growth of volume, but at this stage it is stable and in fact they are quite related to the results of 2019 before the big crisis. What is also true is that you have observed like me, there are more trading arrows which came to this LNG business because maybe they were considering we were making good money.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:52:32
Today, answering your question, no, it's just my view is that today we came back to, I would say, more standard revenues and I hope of course the main growth for LNG trading profits from TotalEnergies will come from the growth of volume of assets. We'll have a volume impact on our trading business which will generate additional profits. We made a mistake when we planned 2025 because we were thinking that we could replicate the last quarter 2024 in full 2025, which is not the case. Again, that's clear. The volatility in 2025 from the gas, you know the European gas price, it moved between $11 and $12 per million BTU. It's not a big volatility. By the way, I'm not unhappy because $11 or $12 per million BTU from my Norwegian gas and my British gas and my Danish gas, it's a very good price.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:53:30
Maybe people, we should not give another way to the trading business. Trading business is adding value but the base business is in fact our upstream and our production. I prefer to gain $12 per million BTU of profits on my Norwegian gas and maybe a little lower volatility on the trading. Let's be clear. We never, maybe because there were exceptional years, incredible years, 2022, 2023, again, 2021, you considered it was the new normal. We never said it was a new normal. We even told you be careful. There are exceptional results each time. Exceptional means exceptional. That's what I want to comment and again I remind you and why I'm linking that to a growth volume. The trading within TotalEnergies is trading around assets. It's an asset-based trading. It's not. We don't take, as you know, it's not the case. That's the base of what we do.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:54:35
There are more competitors, but again, we have more assets than others. It will help our trading business. I think this is the idea, this is the fundamental idea of integration. It's because we have more assets, more volumes, but we have more medium and long-term contracts with Asia. You know what we signed in the last year. These branch-related medium and long-term contracts offer some optionalities to our traders, and the optionalities that we introduce in these contracts have a value. This is why I'm linking that to my asset, to my business. This is the base of it. Some competitors do not have the same assets and contracts. About the competitive sustainability rules, the question is not to have LNG non-compliant. It does not mean the CS3D does not define compliance.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:55:27
The CS3D is a matter of putting in place some rules, but you have to have a duty of vigilance on the supply chain. Some countries have been strong. I invite you to read the letter of the Secretary of Right and Minister Al Kaabi. If you didn't read it, they sent a letter to the European leaders telling them if you keep that in place, we will not take the risk to deliver LNG to Europe. I would say if we don't have LNG coming neither from the U.S. nor from Qatar, my European North Sea assets are taking a lot of value. I would say it's now, I mean, it's not a matter of compliance, a matter of legal reason because in fact, why do they complain?
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
0:56:11
In the CS3D, if you were found guilty by a judge, your penalty could be up to 5% of your worldwide turnover, which is just crazy. The sanction size is completely disproportionate to, in fact, a rule which is against, of course, the declaration. We are all here, we are for human rights. You can ask efforts to companies to control the supply chain, but we don't control everything. If you transform supposed not enough vigilance into such a penalty risk, then it's completely disproportionate. This is a call coming from these two countries. Again, I consider, to be honest, that when we produce LNG in the U.S., as we are the largest exporter of U.S. LNG, we are fully compliant with the duty of vigilance law with all that we produce in the U.S.

Energy Equity Research Analyst
0:57:31
Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up on your earlier comments on the refining portfolio. 80% to 84% utilization in the fourth quarter looks towards the lower half of the historical range. Obviously from a near term perspective, planned turnarounds and maintenance need to be done and undertaken. When you look forward into 2026, how do you see the normalized throughput of the business now? Has there been any deterioration in that normalized level versus what you saw and how you saw it, say, two, three years ago?
Matt Lofting
Energy Equity Research Analyst
0:58:09
Yes, I think so. The question maybe we are cautious again, we were cautious on the $50 per tonne. Maybe there at 84 is just as I told you. We have ANVIRP and SETO, which are two big machines. We have entered into a large plant turnaround so they execute. Of course, it has an impact on the global, I would say, delivery from your portfolio. Let's say you can keep, if you take 82% this quarter, I think we were at 84%, maybe 82% is probably the mid average of the guidance, probably the right one to take into account. I told you that it will be more than compensated with capturing better margins on all the other assets for next year. We are more in the range of 84% to 86% I think for budget. Again, I didn't begin to look to what more colleagues are planning.
Matt Lofting
Energy Equity Research Analyst
0:59:03
I'm waiting to see. I think there are less turnarounds next year. We should have, from this perspective, it should be a better year as well. Again, as we mentioned to you, there were some, I would say, difficulties before the turnaround. On Port Harcourt, turnaround is done. We expect to have a better variability. On Donges, again, we intend to put into service the new unit which will enhance the margins on Donges by beginning of 2026. From this perspective, if the refining margins remain at quite a good level, we will be able to capture even more than this year. Thanks, Patrick.

Elena Himona
Analyst
0:59:57
Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is on marketing, if I may, because your unit margins were up this quarter, and I wonder if you can talk around the drivers of that margin improvement, whether it is structural or temporary. My second question, I noted this quarter you signed some partnerships on the deployment of AI and a global data platform. I obviously don't have the context of your ongoing digitalization effort. I wanted to ask whether it is correct to look at these partnerships perhaps as an effort to speed up and widen the digitalization you have been working on for a number of years. Thank you.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:00:44
Yeah, I take the second question first as we told you. Yeah, we have and I think it will be a topic on which we could focus more on what we are doing. In fact, since 2020 we put in place a digital factory in a bottom up approach with 300, I would say, data experts or data scientists and to very high level a good team. What we observe is that if we want to deploy these new technologies which are speeding up on a worldwide basis, going from the bottom up to scale up is difficult. We decided that it's time now to have a broad effort, a worldwide effort on organizing all these data because there are plenty of data on platforms in refineries, but all that is not connected.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:01:31
If you want to really, for example, enhance your linear program in refineries, the best would be to have access to all these data to develop new tools in order to enhance another additional % of, I would say, use of the refinery and better margins. We have engaged with two large programs which are quite an investment. An investment on the platform with Amazon, which is, I don't remember them now with Amazon, in order to inmate, in order to connect all these physical data to, I would say, a large database, all physically. It will take two years and a half, three years to deploy because we need to go on all the sites, we know where the data is, but we need to connect them and then they will be available.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:02:26
We have also engaged in a very large worldwide program on the ENP site with Cognite which is in advance, I would say, from digitalization. We have made some different pilots with them. Now we are all convinced. Another big program to equip.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:02:44
To.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:02:45
Deploy these Cognite software, which obviously will help us to really accelerate the use of AI. For me, 2025 will be the year where we have really decided to scale and to go from a scale and to take some large worldwide program to give us the capacity to take the most of these new AI tools. It will take a few years to install all of that. If we want to be efficient, and I'm sure, and you know, it's not cost cutting in our case, it's more additional revenues. If I can, with advanced process control tools, thanks to AI, produce 1% more of all my oil fields and my refineries, I can tell you it's quite a lot of free cash. It's worth making the investments. This is what we have done on marketing. I think there are different drivers.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:03:43
Fundamentally, the strategy which is put in place in marketing is value over volume, which means not chasing the additional growth, even if it's difficult for marketers. You know, they love to show you more tons. What we discovered is that it's quite mature markets. They are mature markets, you know, whatever in European market is mature, the lubricant market is mature. It's very difficult to gain market share. The only way to do it is to do it at the expense of margins. What we have decided is to enter into a policy which is a bit higher margins and not less volumes, but not to sacrifice, I would say, the margins at the expense of the volume. This is why, by the way, if you observe our results, we have sold our network in Germany and Netherlands and half of Belgium.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:04:30
There is not much impact, in fact, because we have managed to absorb it, I would say. It's also because fundamentally in marketing we have decided to divest or to stop, not divest, but to stop a business which was very low margin, which was, I would say, sharing some logistics assets which were creating a lot of pass-through volumes but with a minimum margin. This has been reduced because it was not really adding money. It was quite losing a lot of people, structurally. Your answer to your question is that structurally we are in a mode to enhance the margin on marketing and services. That's where we are, and this will continue. I hope I'm clear. Thank you, Patrick.

Kris Copeland

I wonder whether we could talk about another area of French creativity. There is an idea floating around that we should remunerate electricity or wholesale power prices differently. What can you tell us is current appetite for signing new PPAs? How has that market evolved considering that rather interesting regulatory backdrop? You've recently signed a project deal with RWE in France, but also have some considerable CapEx left to go in Germany on the offshore wind front. Maybe you can put things into context and give us the risk reward behind taking that regulatory risk. You've mentioned it already. I just wondered whether you could give us an update on how quickly we should expect news from Mozambique on the ground now that the force majeure has been lifted.
Kris Copeland
Senior Finance Analyst
1:06:41
Thank you,
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:06:41
Mozambique. As you know, we have lifted the mask force majeure. We are now expecting the government to approve our new plan and budget, and we are mobilizing the contractors in order to be able to execute the project within this schedule with a timetable of 2029, and that's where we are. I think we are moving on the first question. It's a complex question because I'm not sure to have fully understood. Let me be clear. I'm not in favor of regulations and regulatory approach. We are more merchant people, we like the market. For us, that means that signing PPAs is the best way to commercialize, I would say, our assets. We know that we need in Europe, you need to sign when you develop. I think you were referring to offshore wind.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:07:45
We signed a contract in France at $65 or $66 per megawatt hour, which is a contract, by the way, where the price can be adapted if the CapEx are higher. The CapEx risk is in fact covered because we could. Not only have we given the price, but the CapEx is linked to the price, so that's a protection. It's also partly inflated through the OpEx.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:08:12
So.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:08:13
At this level, honestly, we can develop an offshore wind project in Europe because it is projects where, in fact, the connection is developed and paid by the DSO, not by us. We are only in charge of the plant itself. Again, we follow that. I think today, you know, you have many creativity there again, in different circles, all that we are in a European market. European market, unique European market, which are fundamentally driven by some market rules, in fact. When I discuss with European authorities, I see little appetite from the Commission to put into. I would say even in some countries like Germany, who believe in the market, to change the rule of these, I would say, electricity market. That's a debate.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:09:15
By the way, in France, the same people who were complaining about the famous system of nuclear commercialization, which was called ARENH two years ago, now are complaining of the new system. People will never be happy. What they want is electricity for free. That's difficult at the end. We need to invest. If everything is too much regulated, it will be against investment. Europe desperately needs to invest more in renewable gas, fiber plants, grids, if we want to ensure security of supply. The reality, so you can have good both. I think I would say, I trust there again the political leaders which are spending a lot of time on this energy story to take the right decision and not to be complacent.

The next question is from Lucas Herrmann, BNP. Please go ahead.
Lucas Herrmann
Managing Director
1:10:16
Yeah, Patrick, thanks very much. Another slightly generic question, but I just wanted to ask for your sort of thoughts on the one part of the complex which is really having a difficult time: chemicals. To the extent to which, when you talk within, when you look at the industry, look at where margins are, you're starting to see better signs of movement to try and restructure not necessarily your own business, but business across the industry, so that we might actually move to a place where profits start to improve. If you could give us some indication of the extent to which the associates line within.
Lucas Herrmann
Managing Director
1:10:54
The profits.
Lucas Herrmann
Managing Director
1:10:57
Within the refining and chemicals business, what proportion of profit actually comes from chemicals? Now, given just how difficult the environment is. Thanks very much.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:11:07
Okay. No, I'm not a chemical company. We are a refining and petrochemical company and we make crack, ethylene, and polyethylene. You know, basics.
Lucas Herrmann
Managing Director
1:11:18
Sorry, Patrick, that's what I'm referring to.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:11:20
No, but just to tell you the truth is that, you know, the situation. The situation is that in fact in terms of cracking capacity, ethylene capacity, China in the last five years went from 50 million tons of cracker to 100 million tons of cracker. They are in fact almost self-sufficient. If they were moving from a large importing country to almost self-sufficient, even exporting, that changed the world pattern. By the way, Chinese companies also suffer from the situation, but other places suffer from the situation. For me, I always been very clear with you. If you want to invest in petrochemicals, you have the fundamental matter, fundamental competitive factor is feedstock.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:12:08
Either you are ethane, cheap LPGs in the U.S. or in the Middle East, or you will face difficulties. That's the situation. We know that all naphtha crackers in Europe are facing competition, which is super difficult, either from the U.S. crackers or from Middle East. By the way, TotalEnergies, since I'm CEO, we have invested in two crackers, one in Port Arthur with Borealis, one with Amiral in Saudi Arabia. I'm consistent with that. I think fundamentally, and we are shutting down some crackers like the one we have just decided in France. That's my view to come back on the proportion. I don't know, it's not big, it's not good, it's not big. I have no miracle recipe compared to my competitors on this one. Again, it's not a major part of our downstream results and cash flow.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:13:03
Most is coming from refining and trading rather more than chemicals. Again, it's part of the integration. When the margins are good, we are happy to capture them. Again, fundamentals, let's invest in the U.S. and in the Middle East. That's all.

Peter Low
Energy Analyst
1:14:07
First question. I think Stephane Michel in New York gave you some answers to that. You know, we never told you it's 12% tomorrow. We told you it's a five-year plan going, by the way, from 10 to 11, from 11 to 12. Part of it, as I told you, is that today we have a sort of burden on our capital employed because we have, I mean, quite a large pipeline of projects which are, of course, non-productive, I would say, capital employed assets which will be because we continue to grow.
Peter Low
Energy Analyst
1:14:40
We have growth to 20% per year and we will execute, which will, of course, as we don't intend to make large M&A on this part, which will transform, I would say, non-productive assets into productive assets. Part of it is there. Then the second part, the other percent, would come from rationalization, better use of the assets, industrializations, and this is what we are doing. We also, I think, frame in New York a clear roadmap by concentrating most of the investments of integrated power on some major markets, the oil and gas countries which are in E&P. The rest we are clear, but where we don't see potential to contribute above 12%, there is no future for them in the portfolio. I mean, that's, I would say, in a way, what we told you. It is a recipe to go to 12%.
Peter Low
Energy Analyst
1:15:38
Honestly, today we are a little lower than 10%, but we will recover from it. Don't forget that there is a contribution from farm-downs; they will come in fourth quarter. All that will give you colors. I would say, therefore, we will raise at 10% and it's a five-year journey. I'm happy with the development of this business. The next target is to be, for me, net cash positive. As soon as we are net cash positive, I'm sure that the valuation of this part of the business will be better because when I will tell you this business is contributing to your dividend, it's a way to have a better leverage on this business. We plan 2028; if we can do 2027, we are working on that. EU ban on Russian energy.
Peter Low
Energy Analyst
1:16:26
Honestly, there has been a new regulation which needs to have some clarification because there is some language there we need to understand what it means exactly. Like, by the way, when EU banned oil in 2022, 2023, it was exact situation. There was a regulation and the LNG regulation is a copy-paste of the old one. There was what they call FAQ where you need to have answers to clarify what is the real scope of ban. For sure the ban is not going any more ocean LNG in Europe, but we want to be sure that the ban is not larger than that. Before I answer your question, and otherwise yes, in this case we have a commitment. If there is no further, I would say, done, I cannot use the force majeure to cancel the contract.
Peter Low
Energy Analyst
1:17:22
If I don't have force majeure, I am committed to offtake some cargoes. We are looking to that precisely today. All lawyers are working, to be honest. We have, which because of course for us, the rule is to be sanction compliant, to be clear. Our lawyers are working on it. It's a fresh regulation. I don't have the full clarity, and I don't want to make my answer longer because I could say something which could become wrong if the lawyers, and again, you have to be. We are always at the Executive Committee on the cautiousness side, I would say from this perspective. I'm waiting to see their reports and to understand exactly the scope of the new EU regulation.

Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon. Patrick and Jean-Pierre Sbraire. Two questions. Want to go back. Patrick, in your answer to the question of adoption of AI, you say that is fairly sizable investment. Can you quantify how big is the investment over the next couple years and whether you have sufficient talent within your organization to really adopt or that you need to go out to hire? At this point, seems like it's pretty difficult to get good talent in the AI adoption area. What is your target in or what you aim to get from AI over the next, say, 25 years? The second question is on Iraq. Oh, okay.
Patrick Pouyanné

Paul Chang

1:19:13
Okay. Sorry.
Paul Chang

1:19:15
Patrick, second question is Iraq. Can you tell us how's the situation on the ground? I suppose that the security is good enough for you to deploy your people. Why, what is the bottleneck or the barrier for Iraq to significantly increase their production at this point? You and some of your peers are now rushing in and signing contracts. If you're saying that those contracts, the terms are good, is there a concern that Iraq could turn into a major production growth area, which in turn is going to depress oil prices over the next several years? Just want to hear how you think about that. Thank you.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:20:05
Okay, first question. AI, the program I mentioned, both represent more than €300 million or $350 million, I would say worldwide. It's quite an investment for these data platforms at the worldwide level. First comment. Second comment. In terms of people, we have some assistance come from the Emerson guys, Aspentech, or from Cognite. Remember that we have 300 digital factory with 300 people. Of course, we are using part of these people to help to deploy the program. They are there, they are valuable, they know about it. We have built these competencies in the last five years. The third answer is that there is a nice country in order to get access to good, high competencies with not so high cost, which is called India. It's also a way for us to, in fact, grow in the digital.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:20:59
For us, we are looking today to, we need to grow, I would say, our technical competencies and in terms of people to have more resources in the side of electricity, of power, and in the area of digital. Today, we are seriously thinking to enhance or to grow our presence there. We are discussing about competent center in India. It's part, by the way, of our way as well to contribute to the, I would say, cash saving program that we mentioned. This is where I am. I know it's a point, but in fact what I've observed is that we have been able to attract people in this field with a reasonable price because we offer them some real, I would say, use case. We are very interesting use case in the field of energy. You can use AI in many areas. It's good.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:21:53
Iraq, on the ground, it's okay. Otherwise, we just signed the full EPC contract. If we were to doubt, we would not have done it honestly. In the Basra area, the situation is good. I can speak only for the areas where we are. We have deliberately located our teams in the south of the country, in the Basra area, because it's a more, I would say, united area, unified area. In Iraq, there are other areas that I would be more careful, to be clear. In our area, we are fine. The barrier partly is still security because you cannot, what I say for Basra is maybe not true for the whole country, to be honest. It's not true. Second, in fact, you need investment and investment, and you know the issue for Iraq. Again, I'm happy to have been the big company which came back first.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:22:47
You know, we went there in 2021, we finalized the contract in 2023. We are FID all the phases in 2025 and we produce in 2028, 2029. The cycle is eight years. I think we are maybe a little slow. I'm not sure because I can tell you all that is in fact from my point of view as a CEO, quite a remarkable journey in a new country. I'm very happy with all the work the teams have done. I contributed myself by supporting them many times there. When people think today that yes, there is a potential in Iraq, it's clear, but it will not depress oil prices before many years. It's good for the country and again the country and I know what will happen if there are more companies to come. The temptation will be to decrease the margins and then again it will not work.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:23:47
That's the history. I hope the country has taken some lessons of what happened from 2010 to 2020. If we don't have the right reward for the risk we take, there is no investment. That's a question of capital allocation. Yes, and that's why, by the way, to answer your question, to be clear, if we decided to move to come back in Iraq in 2021, but we see quite a long first quarter and in my plan, in my view, Iraq will be a growth area for TotalEnergies beyond 2030 and we work on other projects. That's what I'm thinking. I don't see an impact on the short term or short medium term, but potential is.

Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:25:05
Okay. Exploration, you know, I've been consistent since I became CEO. I think there is one thing we did not change, which is a budget for exploration. It was $800 million to $1 billion. I put it as a sort of rule of the game when I became CEO because strongly I think it was. It's not because you spend more, you find more. At a certain point, you need to be efficient and oblige your exploration team to take Sochi. I'm happy, by the way. By the way, Kevin has led this team during the last 10 years. He became Exploration Manager or the President almost the same time. He has, I would say, developed some ideas. Ten years is a long cycle in exploration.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:25:44
When he told us one year ago that he aspired to do something else, it was fine for us because we thought it was the right time to renew. In fact, having the focal approach because again, exploration is a different business. Again, it's not a matter of dollars, a matter of ideas, of way to approach. I'm very happy to have welcomed in the company Nicola Mavela, who is coming from a successful exploration company. He has, of course, himself been educated in different environments. So probably new ideas he will have. I told him that he's free to do and to lead the team. It's not a one, you know, it's a team building quite a lot of people. You need to take the risk to explore, you need to build some consensus.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:26:29
You can drive your people in different, I would say, directions in terms of concepts and being creative. I think it's very good. I hope and I'm convinced that Nicola will be able to have the same success that we had with Kevin in the last 10 years. It's not a matter of money, it's a matter of ideas and then to make choices. By the way, you notice that in the last quarter we have been active on taking some licenses back in Nigeria, which has been unexplored for more than 10 years. It's a pity. It's probably the most Niger Delta. It's probably the most prolific delta in Africa. No licenses were awarded. We are happy to have the first ones to IOCs. We went as well to a country like Liberia, it's a new one. Congo is more mature.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:27:13
Between, we managed to get a license on which our explorers were excited. I hope they were fine. We'd have a nice gift for Christmas. We'll see. We will continue to explore in other countries. Exploration. I heard during that Maroucho that it seems that some companies are rediscovering exploration. For TotalEnergies, we never give up on exploration. I always considered as part of the value creation and again a lesson to my colleagues, not because you spend more, but you will find more. We spend more evidence, you take more risk, and if you take more risk, you have more disappointing wells. It's a question of finding the right metrics. I think it's good for an IOC, a major like us, when we can raise 20, 25 wells per year. That's good, that's enough to find some nice wells.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:28:01
Namibia, South Africa, you know, Namibia, that we have some exploration to continue to do and we look to priorities also to develop business, and South Africa, you follow like Vision News, there is a legal context which seems to be more complex than in other countries. Each time we want to do it, we need to go to court. It's a little difficult. We want. I think that the South African government has made some public statements that they want to find a way to go to ease the exploration. We hope they will manage because of course for us it's important. We cannot explore, we cannot spend money in a geography if we have to face permanently courts and the permitting become really complex because it's not only of drilling one or two of the exploration well, then it will be to develop and we explore to develop.
Patrick Pouyanné

Jason Gabelman
Energy Equity Research Analyst
1:29:19
Yeah, hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask firstly on CapEx trajectory, and it looks like organic CapEx has been a bit volatile the past few quarters. I'm wondering what's driving that quarter-to-quarter volatility. We've seen some other peers that have more stable CapEx that kind of peaks in 4Q. Wondering moving forward, is this level that you're at now a better go-forward pace to consider, or should we expect more volatility quarter to quarter? My second one is just on the ramp up in production next year. You've previously guided to a reduction in reinvestment rates in 2027, which I suppose implies higher cash flow ramping at some point next year along with new production coming online. How should we think about that production and cash flow ramp next year and into 2027, is it back half weighted?

Jason. You are very quarterly driven in your questions, but my commitment to you, the commitment of the company is annual budget of CapEx and by the way, it's an annual budget of net CapEx. You know, it's organic CapEx plus acquisition, minus sales, minus divestments. I think we have a long track record of being in compliance with our budget. Annual budget of CapEx. I think since I've been CEO, I think 10 years in a row, you don't see that we have not respected the CapEx budget, the annual CapEx budget and again what we told you today and what we said at the beginning of the year, it will be $17, $17.5 billion. I can tell you we'll land in $17, $17.5 billion. As we told you that the net acquisition is expected to be at $1.5 billion.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:31:12
You can calculate yourself the organic CapEx for time. The first fourth quarter. I don't follow honestly the stability of the organic CapEx quarter to quarter. It depends on, you know, some projects when you put into production as we have done this year, all Mero in Brazil, Tyra in Denmark, Ballymore in the U.S. or Ballymore or Jack. Yeah, Ballymore. That means that this quarter there was a lot of CapEx, is decreasing because you have put into production and some of your CapEx. Some of our projects are ramping up. I'm not at all. I have no KPIs to have a stable quarterly organic CapEx. To be honest, at the end of the day my KPI is to be sure that we are within the annual budget and if we can be a little lower, I'm happy but not so much.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:32:05
I'm not happy because sometimes it means that some projects are late. I prefer to really be in our budget. First point. Sorry to disappoint but it's not a major issue. I'm not in a, I mean to be clear, we are not in a company with short cycle CapEx permanently where you can maybe make more, less volatility. The second one, I think it's the same answer to that. Lydia, if I remember the first big of the first question I had. You have to wait for 2026. Let's keep. You have to be a little patient until February. We'll give you more color. It's clear that again we gave you a point. I think in the chart of 2027 when we speak about reinvestment rate. We told you that in 2017. Yes, I remember. The reinvestment rate will go down from 70% to something like 50%.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:33:01
It was a chart which was in the New York Stock Exchange package and side deck.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:33:06
Sorry.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:33:07
That's reality. It's coming from both. It's coming from, on one side, higher cash flows because we are delivering along the three years. The figure 27 means by end of 2027, so it's a three-year decrease. It's not beginning or don't know which quarter, and it's an annual one. It's the end, to be clear. That doesn't mean that all, it just means that it's an average of the year 2027. It's coming as well from the discipline of the CapEx because we have your guidance. It's $16 billion, so both will contribute to this reinvestment rate, which is lower by 20%. If you have 20%, if you are lowering reinvestment rate, it's good, and it's consistent with a free cash flow per share increase that we have announced.
Patrick Pouyanné
Chairman and CEO
1:33:55
That's a way to explain why we will be able to increase the free cash flow per share, because we have more cash and less CapEx. That's where we want to embark all of investors who trust TotalEnergies.

Paul Hudson
CEO
0:01:25
Thanks, Thomas. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our growth momentum continued in Q3 with €12.4 billion in sales, up 7% over last year's high base of comparison. Sales growth was primarily driven by our new launches and the performance of Dupixent, which reached €4 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. After the third quarter performance, we are confident in the business outlook for the remainder of the year and reiterate our full-year 2025 sales guidance. This positive outlook includes our expectations for the business in the U.S., our largest market by sales. We continue to work with the administration and policymakers in the U.S. and around the world on policies that improve access to treatments, lower prices for patients, and improve health systems and protect science.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:02:15
Our recent announcement on the expansion of our patient affordability program, offering improved access to all our insulins, is a great example of this work, which I'll discuss in a little more detail later in the presentation. Now, let me highlight the contribution of our new launches, which have been a significant driver of this quarter's strong performance. Our launches delivered €1.8 billion this quarter, with more than 40%, and now represent 15% of our total sales. To put this in perspective, our launches represent almost half of Dupixent sales this quarter, demonstrating their significant contribution to our growth. We've strengthened our commercial portfolio with three new additions: Ayvakit, our medicine for both advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis; the first Sanofi sales of Nuvaxovid, offering an important protein-based and non-mRNA alternative for COVID-19 vaccination; and WARILS, our new BTK inhibitor designed as a multi-immune modulator.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:03:14
This innovative medicine provides a new option for patients with immune thrombocytopenia that extends beyond their platelet count needs to addressing quality-of-life burdens. We're seeing good uptake across our portfolio of new medicines and vaccines. Bayfortis, which achieved blockbuster status last year in its first full year of sales, continues its expansion into new geographies. Altuvio is on track to reach blockbuster status this year, and Ayvakit could become our next blockbuster in 2026. Dupixent has reached a new milestone this quarter, exceeding €4 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. More than eight years after its initial launch in atopic dermatitis, we saw an increase of over 30% in the number of patients during the last 12 months. In the U.S., we've surpassed the €3 billion quarterly sales mark, maintaining leadership in both new and total prescriptions across established indications.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:04:12
Our launches in the recently approved indications COPD, CSU, and BP are progressing as planned. Outside the U.S., sales grew 21%, exceeding €1 billion in the quarter. We continue our efforts to make Dupixent available to more patients, helped by the positive CHMP recommendation for CSU in the EU and regulatory submission for CSU in children in the U.S. and EU. Turning to our vaccine business, Q3 sales were €3.4 billion. This performance compares to a high base in the previous year and reflects the competitive price pressure, as well as a lower flu immunization rate in the U.S. A new highlight among our respiratory vaccines is the early start of Nuvaxovid, the only non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine available in the U.S. and from our collaboration with Novavax. First shipments of Nuvaxovid were delivered in the U.S. in September.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:05:11
In RSV, Bayfortis continues its impressive expansion, up 20% this quarter, and now available in 40 countries. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we decided to discontinue our RSV toddler program. While the safety profile was acceptable, the predetermined criteria for efficacy was not met in the planned futility analysis. The PPH and booster franchise remains an important contributor to our vaccine business, with the performance in Q3 reflecting phasing in the first half of the year. Sanofi has a proud legacy in flu vaccines, and we remain committed on bringing innovation to strengthen our leadership in flu and to provide better protection for patients. Our FLUNA-DHD study published in The Lancet last week demonstrated that our high-dose flu vaccine, Afluelda, known as FluZone High Dose in North America, provided superior protection versus standard dose vaccine on the sometimes devastating consequences of flu.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:06:09
Data showed an 8.8% reduction in pneumonia or flu hospitalizations and an important 32% reduction in laboratory-confirmed flu hospitalizations versus standard dose vaccines. We are expanding access to this beneficial protection with positive phase three data that support a label update, extending the age down to 50 years for Afluelda FluZone High Dose. Looking ahead, we're advancing our flu pandemic preparedness with two programs, while improving vaccination convenience with positive data on flu-COVID combination vaccines. These achievements underscore our commitment to delivering enhanced protection against respiratory viruses to more people worldwide. In addition to our unwavering commitment to innovation in respiratory viruses, we're also steadfast in our commitment to improve patients' access to healthcare.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:07:02
Our Global Health Unit has reached a remarkable milestone: a million patients treated for non-communicable diseases across more than 40 low and middle-income countries since 2021, putting us on track to reach 2 million patients by 2030. We trained over 27,000 healthcare workers and reached 4 million people through our partnership programs during this same period. We're not stopping there. In the U.S., we're expanding our insulins value savings program to ensure every American has access to our insulins at just $35 per month. This initiative builds on Sanofi's longstanding efforts to provide patients access to a reliable and affordable supply of critical medicines. Thank you, and I will now hand over to François, our CFO, for more details on the financials.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:07:54
Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone. In Q3, our med sales grew by 7% at constant exchange rates. This growth was primarily driven by pharma and more specifically by immunology and recent launches. Our new launch is demonstrating a strong momentum with 41% sales growth, while Dupixent sales grew by 26% this quarter. Vaccine sales were down, primarily due to flu, as expected. This decrease resulted from a combination of competitive price pressure, mainly in Germany, and lower vaccination rates. At published rates, net group sales increased by 2%, impacted by a negative foreign exchange effect. These solid results highlight our ability to drive growth against headwinds. Our business gross margin increased by 2.3 percentage points this quarter, with a continued improvement in product mix, enhanced by productivity gains.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:08:49
We now capture the full benefit of Dupixent's improved manufacturing process, as well as a contribution from Ayvakit since the Blueprint Medicines closing in mid-July. As we move into 2026, the gross margin profile will return to its fundamental growth as the step up from Dupixent's C3 manufacturing transition is now complete. Operating expenses grew by 6%. Excluding the impact of the Blueprint Medicines acquisition, operating expenses grew by low single digit, highlighting our cost discipline. R&D expenses increased by 5%, broadly reflecting the underlying activity level. We continue to invest in sales and marketing to support our launches, and G&A costs were slightly down, in line with our objective to keep them broadly stable going forward. Other operating income and expenses are moving up, primarily due to the increased share of profits paid to Regeneron as Dupixent continues its strong growth trajectory.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:09:53
Business EPS reached €2.91, a robust growth of €0.19 and 13% compared to Q3 2024. This strong performance reflects our compelling sales growth and increasing gross margin, combined with cost discipline. Looking at our year-to-date progress, we are maintaining stronger earnings momentum with 9% sales growth and business EPS growing faster at 12%. It fully supports our guidance for the full year and demonstrates our ability to deliver profitable growth consistently. Based on our year-to-date performance, we reiterate our full-year guidance of high single-digit sales growth and low double-digit business EPS growth at constant exchange rates. We have now completed the acquisitions of Drensbios DR0201, Vigil Neuroscience, and Blueprint Medicines, and their associated costs are fully factored in our guidance. While we typically provide full-year guidance at the beginning of each year, we can share a few business trends for next year, which you may find useful for modeling purposes.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:11:03
R&D next year is expected to increase moderately. We will continue investing in sales and marketing to support our product launches, as well as our strong sales momentum. At the same time, we will remain disciplined on G&A costs, with the objective to keep them broadly stable. We expect to achieve around €500 million of capital gains from divestment, similar to what we anticipate for 2025. Regarding Amvudra royalties, based on the latest evaluated pharma sales consensus, the implied royalties are now expected around €700 million for next year. You will find a slide with the updated Amvudra royalty considerations reflecting current external consensus in the appendices of this presentation. Another indicator for 2026 is a reduction of approximately €300 million reimbursement from Regeneron for the R&D balance. Both items, Amvudra gains and Regeneron R&D reimbursement, will offset each other next year.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:12:11
We continue to execute our capital allocation policy and will remain disciplined and balanced across four priorities: investing in organic growth drivers, pursuing selective bolt-on acquisitions, maintaining our policy of progressive dividends, and executing opportunistic share buybacks. Based on our projected trajectory for 2026 and beyond, we remain confident in our ability to sustain our profitable growth momentum for the next few years. I now hand over to Houman to provide an update on the progress of our innovative pipeline.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:12:48
Thank you, François. I'm pleased to share our Q3 pipeline achievements with progress in many programs. We received regulatory approvals for WARILS in the United States, in ITP, and T-Yield in China. Further, we received regulatory submission acceptances for Dupixent CSU in children in the U.S. and in the EU. The FDA nominated T-Yield for the new Commissioner's National Priority Voucher Program to speed up the review. WARILS ITP was submitted in Japan, and Sarclisa subcutaneous was accepted globally in myeloma. Our phase three programs have delivered successful readouts, with amlodipine meeting the primary endpoints in the phase three study in atopic dermatitis dose one and FluZone High Dose in people 50 years and above. We also commenced dosing first patient in new phase three studies, one of the two studies for lansecamig in COPD and WARILS in sickle cell disease and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:13:48
Finally, WARILS is emerging as a multi-immune modulation platform in rare diseases, with an approval in the U.S. and a positive recommendation in the EU for ITP. Multiple designations across new indications further strengthening our rare disease portfolio. Please turn to the next slide. Moving to dermatology, amlodipine met all primary and secondary key endpoints in the first phase three study in AD. Data demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in several measures of skin clearance. As an example, looking at the VIGA measure, the efficacy progressively increased and showed no plateau at 24 weeks. Further, amlodipine offers patient-friendly quarterly dosing. There were no new safety concerns identified in this study. Oceana AD is a comprehensive program, including five phase three studies in adults and adolescents, biologic experienced patients, and across different geographies. We anticipate full data to report out throughout 2026.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:14:50
Brevecamig, Altianf Alpha, and OX40 ligand nanobody achieved its primary objective in a phase 2a study in HS. We observed clinically meaningful improvements in both primary and secondary endpoints in biologically naive patients at week 16. Brevecamig was well tolerated. Data were presented at EADV in Paris in September, where I also had the pleasure to meet many of you at our IR roundtable. Our phase 2b study is now starting its recruitment. Please turn to the next slide. Moving to respiratory, amlodipine has shown intriguing efficacy in its phase two study in asthma, particularly in a difficult-to-treat subgroup. While the primary endpoint of annualized asthma exacerbation rate reduction at week 48 did not reach statistical significance at the highest dose, notable improvements were observed in the secondary endpoints.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:15:41
The heterogeneous inflammation subgroup of patients with high blood eosinophils of greater than 300 cells per microliter and elevated neutrophils at greater than 4,000 cells per microliter showed the greatest benefit. Treatment was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns. We're still analyzing study data, including biomarkers. Next steps will be subject to prioritizations within our overall respiratory portfolio. We're pleased by the recent Etoroprene Alpha data, which showed superiority to the standard of care in the phase two study, the alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency emphysema. The recombinant protein has a longer half-life and can provide higher AAT serum levels with less frequent dosing of either once every three or four weeks. A phase two open-label study is currently ongoing, which will add to the safety data.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:16:32
We will now engage in discussions with regulatory agencies to see if we can move ahead based on the data we have, supported by the upcoming safety studies. Please turn to the next slide. LED212 dotamate, our radioligand, showed intriguing overall response rates in patients with somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, otherwise known as GEP-NETs, a group of difficult-to-treat rare endocrinological cancers. In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy naive patients, the overall response rate was 57.1%, and in PRRT-exposed patients, the overall response was 19.2%. Both measures were based on blinded independent central review. We observed a manageable safety profile that was similar across both cohorts. In immunology, our oral TNF alinutunfib didn't meet the predefined primary endpoint of ACR20 but showed clinically meaningful efficacy in a phase two study in uncontrolled advanced treatment-naive rheumatoid arthritis patients on background methotrexate across endpoints requiring a deeper disease control, including ACR50 and ACR70.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:17:46
This oral treatment has the potential to be used as a combination backbone therapy with internal and external oral medicines, with the next step currently being evaluated. Finally, we're close to initiating two replicate phase three studies for Duvaticuk in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This treatment offers patient-friendly subcutaneous dosing with a potential competitive safety and efficacy by selectively targeting the DC3 receptor. This follows the positive phase two data that read out last year and were presented at the ECHO meeting this year. Next slide, please. As a conclusion, let me share a status of our key mid and late-stage development projects.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:18:30
Our immunology pipeline includes medicines with available data, such as amlodipine phase three program in AD, with further potential lifecycle management, lansecamig in phase two in different asthma patient subgroups, and potential LCM, such as COPD, as well as brevecamig in HS and others in mid-stage development, some of which I covered earlier, like alinutunfib and Duvaticuk. On etopicumab, I can share that a decision to move forward in COPD will be made subject to regulatory discussions and in collaboration with our valued partner, Regeneron. In rare diseases, WARILS is now approved for ITP in the U.S., with potential for multiple new indications, venglustat, currently in phase three for Fabry disease and Gaucher's disease type three, and lastly, etodolacrine Alpha, successful in phase two for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, with encouraging update just the other day.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:19:23
Sarclisa is well underway with a subcutaneous formulation already approved across different lines and combination regimens in multiple regions and LED212 dotamate in GAPNATs with data this week at ESME. In neurology, colibrutinib is in review for SPMS with a revised PDUFA date of December 28, and in phase three for primary progressive multiple sclerosis, with a readout before the end of the year. Fexalimab is in phase three for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in SPMS-2, and lastly, relipiravir in two phase three studies for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Finally, in vaccines, we have multiple phase three programs underway, such as rabies, BCV21, yellow fever vaccines, and broad opportunities in flu. Flu, COVID combinations, and pandemic flu right behind, as Paul covered earlier in his slides. Next slide, please.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:20:20
On my last slide, I plan to cover my usual newsflow slide for the remaining three months of the year and all of 2026. The last significant items of 2025 are U.S. decisions on palibrutinib in SPMS and phase three readouts in PPMS and multiple regulatory decisions. Next year, we expect the remaining phase three readouts for amlodipine in AD. In rare diseases, we also expect venglustat phase three readouts in two indications. In all cases, if positive, regulatory submissions will follow later in the year. In addition, we anticipate multiple regulatory submissions based on data we have already received this year, as well as regulatory decisions for medicines and vaccines under review.
Houman Ashrafian

Hi there, thanks for taking my questions. First, I wonder if you could just update us on the Poly-SPMS regulatory debate and confidence resolving any questions the FDA has had with that delayed PDUFA. The second one, just to make sure there's no confusion in the market given the debate at 2Q, can we assume that your wording of profitable growth for 2026 means EBIT and EPS ahead of sales? Thank you.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:22:13
Okay, thank you. Do you want to provide some clarity on the regulatory piece on the SPMS colibrutinib?
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:22:21
Yeah, thanks for the question. Pretty straightforward. As we reported earlier in the year, the FDA requested an extension. We've submitted data sets with the FDA, continue conversations, and look forward to the PDUFA December 28.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:22:38
Thank you, François.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:22:40
Yes, on profitable growth, I confirm that the idea is to have, as we go down through the P&L, all items growing faster than at the upper end of the P&L, which means basically gross margin growing faster than sales growth, BOI growing faster than gross margin, and EPS growing faster than BOI. We have achieved that each and every single quarter this year. We'll do it in 2025. We expect to get there in 2026, and we are working in the summer to deliver the same objective for the following years as well.

Thank you. Perhaps I could ask the obligatory U.S. policy question. Do you have any updates on your conversations with the U.S. administration? Is it more complex for you with shared assets like Dupixent? Should we be concerned about a degree of silence right now, or is it simply that there is more of a bottleneck in terms of a long queue to speak with the administration? Maybe Trump's busy agenda, just any color on that sort of ability to communicate. I'll stop there. Thank you.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:23:53
Thank you. I think our answer is pretty straightforward, which is we've had ongoing dialogue with the U.S. government and indeed multiple governments since before we received the letter, back at the end of July, I think it was. We focus on making sure that people understand the value we can bring, and those conversations have continued throughout this whole process. You could probably comment on bottlenecks or other implications, but I think that's probably as much as we can say at this point. Okay, thank you, Luisa. Next question, please.

Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. I have a question on Bayfortis. As you guys said, the Q3 orders have been impacted by inventory carryover from last season. Could you please give us a sense of how Q4 ordering trends are tracking so far? Are we still expecting a three-Q, four-Q equal split? Also, given the competition that is ongoing, how do we see the trend? Will we map competition? Is it going to impact the four-Q number, given we know that Merck actually entered the market late in three-Q? We saw very strong growth in the ex-US market. What do you see the opportunities there? What is your overall perspective for Bayfortis in 2026? Thank you.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:25:39
Okay, so the four questions, Tom, are for you.
Thomas Triomphe
Head of Vaccines
0:25:42
Bayfortis is a rich question. Thank you very much, Shirley. Maybe a couple of points to address these different elements. Thank you for giving an eye to the Bayfortis performance in Q3. As you noticed, a few points of highlight. First of all, overall for Bayfortis, you saw that we increased our performance versus last year. We have done that notably by extending the penetration to about 40 countries. In your question, there were some geographic elements to it. On the U.S. part, yes, absolutely, you're correct on what's going on in the U.S. Yes, we do confirm the guidance that we had provided at the last quarter at Q4. We expect it to be roughly in the same order of magnitude as Q3 for Bayfortis overall, for global Bayfortis performance. The second point, I think you wanted to mention a couple of points on the environment and the competition.
Thomas Triomphe
Head of Vaccines
0:26:41
Without talking about the competition specifically, because we don't do that, maybe I can say a few words on the fact that actually, if you look at last year, 2024, the first year of full supply, and Bayfortis was a blockbuster. You remember that if you look at the U.S. performance, the total, I will say, coverage rate of all babies in the U.S. was around 55% for all RSV solutions available. Roughly 55% of babies were getting some form of RSV protection. We really focused in 2025, and I think we will be focusing in 2026, to increase that vaccination coverage rate. We expect 2025 to land around 70% vaccination coverage rate in the U.S. That is why we are welcoming all efforts from everywhere to make sure that we increase the importance of awareness. What we are seeing in the signals in the U.S.
Thomas Triomphe
Head of Vaccines
0:27:34
is that by far, Bayfortis is the favored product, the favored prescription from U.S. prescribers, simply due to the fact that it's highly differentiated. With an extended half-life of 71 days, it makes it by far the longest-acting monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of RSV. It has an incredible real-world evidence behind it. That is very important moving forward.
Paul Hudson

Okay, thank you. Next question, please.

0:28:02
Yes, next question, Matthew Weston from UBS. Matthew?
Matthew Weston
Analyst
0:28:08
Thank you. Two questions, please. François, I'm going to buck the trend. Most people ask 2026 guidance questions. I'm going to ask a 2027 guidance question. Slide 29 flags the Regeneron R&D reimbursement stepping down. It's something that's been familiar, I think, for many people for a while, but maybe not fully reflected in consensus. The step-down is actually much greater in 2027 than in 2026. Your slide implies about a half a billion EBIT gap in 2027. I'm just trying to understand, are there any additional levers within manufacturing, gross margin, or the business that could help mitigate that? Or that's something that we've just got to get prepared for, even though it's a year and a half away? Then one for Houman. You set out your enthusiasm for amlodipine.
Matthew Weston
Analyst
0:28:59
Lilly has just reported the findings from the phase 3 ADJOIN extension study for Edglis, which looked at Q8 week dosing and showed very limited erosion in efficacy. I'd be very interested if you think that limits the differentiation for amlodipine where you were aiming for your 12 week to be differentiated. Thank you.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:29:20
Okay, thank you. François, you want to catch that? Maybe Brian and Houman, depending. Yep.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:29:26
Yes, Matthew, I think that this is a good question for 2027 indeed, and which is what I presented in the last call at the end of July. The fact that in 2026, we will have, we will lose about €300 million of R&D reimbursement from Regeneron. As I said a few minutes ago, it will be entirely offset by the additional royalties that we will receive from Amvudra. In 2027, indeed, we will have a much more significant amount of R&D reimbursement in terms of decrease because we will lose €800 million from one year to the other. This will not be fully offset in 2027 by the additional Amvudra royalties, which will be around €300 million, which is in one of my appendices in this presentation as well. We will have a gap indeed of about half a billion.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:30:10
Will we be able to cover it with other exceptional items or, let's say, non-recurring items? The answer is no. That being said, I mean, we will continue growing at a reasonable pace as well. I said it last time that if there was one year where we were not sure about increasing our profitability and deliver this profitable growth, it would be 2027 for that same reason. That being said, and I repeat what I said last quarter, which is we expect our BOI to increase in absolute value in 2027 in spite of this impact. We will be able in absolute value to cover the gap, the €500 million gap. Most probably, I believe that we may be in a position, still early to say, to even increase our profitability in terms of BOI in 2027 as well. I say we may be, still very early.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:30:59
We have not even completed our 2026 budget, so I want to be careful. Directionally, there is probably a possibility, largely as a consequence of the growth leverage that we will get from superior growth.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:31:12
Okay, thank you. Maybe Brian first and then Houman.
Brian Foard
Head of General Medicines
0:31:16
Yeah, I think that's a great question. Thank you very much. I think as you look at the marketplace, we've always said this is a marketplace that's going to continue to grow. The biopenetration rate is extremely low, just over 14%. More assets coming into the marketplace will only help the marketplace grow. As you can see from our growth today in Dupixent, a product that's already on the marketplace, it's benefiting from other therapies coming to the marketplace. That said, one thing that we've said consistently for a very long time, these IL-13s are incomplete therapies, and we've seen them on the market now. Actually, if you look at LEVRI that's been on the market for nearly a year now, it has single-digit share. We're seeing while it's helping grow the marketplace, it's really not taking very much share from Dupixent.
Brian Foard
Head of General Medicines
0:31:54
Dupixent, we believe, still has a very strong profile. Each of these still have these dosing ranges that are either two weeks or at the best four weeks is what we're seeing right now. We think that there's a lot of room for a much more durable dose in the marketplace, assuming we finish the regulatory trials and get it to the marketplace for NEMA or for, excuse me, for.
Paul Hudson

Human, nope.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D

Just Matthew, thanks for the question, as well as the BioPen comment, which is important. This is a totally novel mechanism, an apical node in the immune response with not only durability, but multiple differentiating factors. We remain, based on the data, actually, for the case one study, encouraged by the potential for amla.

Seamus Fernandez

0:32:47
Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick questions. Can you update us on relipiravir and the timing dynamics around that? It's unclear if that's still on track for second half 2026 readout in CIDP. I just wanted to clarify that. More broadly, just hoping to get a better understanding of when we're going to learn more about the programs that have had unfortunate outcomes and where a number of programs are under review, including the oral TNF, including etopicumab. It seems like there's a lot of secondary analysis exploration going on and holding on to assets as part of the pipeline. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of when we're going to know the advancement or elimination of some of those assets that haven't quite lived up to at least investor expectations. Thanks.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:33:55
Okay, Human?
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:33:56
Thanks, Seamus. I'll try and be succinct on this one. On relipiravir, we've updated the timelines at this Q3. The reality is that the outcome for the two phase three studies for CIDP are just creeping over the year. This is purely a patient recruitment phenomenon, and we look forward to seeing the results of those studies. You'll remember the phase two studies were extremely encouraging. On your second point about when you'll see the data and when we'll make decisions, obviously those data sets will all be presented at the relevant scientific congresses. I've already announced today that we will go forward subject to regulatory approval with our partners in etopicumab, so there's no tardiness there. Obviously, we have to take a regulatory opinion before we move forward into replication phase three.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:34:55
For the other studies, I've already alluded to the fact that we will take a portfolio view on asthma with a number of our assets and figure out what we take forward in asthma. On brevecamig, we've just had access to the results. I've outlined the importance of ACR50 and 70 and the fact that they're clinically meaningful. We'll figure out, as we've always said, we've been consistent in our view that we'll figure out exactly the role of brevecamig in mono and combination therapies, both with our own molecules and partners.
Paul Hudson

0:35:25
Thank you, Houman. Thank you, Seamus. Great questions. You know, we find it, we've seen it with many of our competitors having hits and misses in immunology over the last months that these extra levels of thinking actually are worth doing and standing in good stead because you really do pick the right patient population. Taking time, I think, is wise for us. Next question.

Simon Baker
Analyst
0:35:54
Thank you for taking my questions too, please. Firstly, on Dupixent, François, you said that the gross margin benefit from manufacturing improvements is now fully being captured. I just wonder if you could give us some idea of the magnitude of the gross margin improvement this quarter, which is down to Dupixent manufacturing. A question on indication opportunities. Houman, you mentioned rosibutinib in Graves' disease. That's potentially not a particularly rare condition. I just want to get your thoughts on the potential you see there. Also, the other one in light of Moderna's failure this week is CMV vaccination. I know you've been in this space in the 1990s. I just wonder what your level of appetite was for it now. Thanks so much.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:36:47
All right, thank you, Simon. François.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:36:49
Yes, Simon. On Dupixent, the gross margin contribution from the C3 manufacturing was actually very limited in Q3 itself. I mean, this is, we just took the opportunity to mention that we have completed the full implementation of this new technique, which has spread over a couple of years, actually. It did not have a significant impact in Q3 per se. I take the opportunity to mention that our gross margin increased globally for the company by 2.5% in Q3 and by 1.8% in H1. Most of the factors contributing to it are still relevant for the future to a certain extent. One of them is volume growth. Our volume grew by 12% since the beginning of the year. We expect to continue at a high level. We are obviously benefiting from a positive product mix, including this quarter.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:37:41
Ayvakit, actually, Ayvakit is much more significant than the new manufacturing technique for Dupixent. We are also obviously benefiting from the industrial restructuring that we did over the last couple of years. Plus, there were some one-offs this quarter, last year and this year, which did create a little bit of positive impact as well. If we look at it underlying, because we were at a high range, once again with 2.5% of increase in Q3, if we exclude the one-offs on some of the items that will not necessarily replicate each and every single quarter, like Ayvakit, for example, you can consider that the underlying gross margin increase that we have experienced since the beginning of the year is around 1%.

Thank you, François. Okay, Houman, Graves, and then Thomas, CMV.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:38:45
Okay, sorry, thanks for that insightful question. As you'll know, Graves is a well-established autoantibody-related disorder. The classic long-acting thyroid-stimulating antibodies, the TSHR antibodies, are important. Number one, it's a canonical autoimmune disorder. Number two, we know from investigator-initiated studies that B-cell suppression is a successful therapy, particularly for the ophthalmopathy. Thirdly, with our unique covalent reversible molecule in rosibutinib that has already shown significant promise in multiple disorders, including Weiher IgG4 disease and ITP, I think that Graves is a promising opportunity. We look forward to taking the molecule forward. You are completely correct that it's not a rare disorder of that sort per se. It's not super rare. Therefore, I think it's a potential opportunity, particularly the ophthalmopathy.
Paul Hudson

Thomas Triomphe
Head of Vaccines
0:39:45
CMV, I'll be short. Not much to say. The news is very recent, as you know very well, Simon. I will not comment on anything to see the full data set. The only thing I can refer to is indeed, you know, about quite a while ago, a few decades ago, we had worked on this antigen. It's a difficult target. While we had reached some, I would say, interim efficacy, our assumption at that time was that it would not be sufficient to reach a protection level. That's why we had interrupted this program quite a while ago. Sadly, overall, because the field of CMV vaccination is an important field, we would welcome a vaccine against this devastating disease.

Next question from Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Richard.
Richard Vosser
Analyst
0:40:33
Hi, thanks for taking my question. Question on Dupixent and just giving us a little bit more on the development around COPD and also the gross to net, how that developed in the quarter and how we should think about that in 2026, but also how the COPD launch is going, seems to be developing a little bit better this quarter. Second question, just on the inhibrics data. Just to file, I think you need some of the more long-term safety data that you called out from the open-label extension. Just wondering what, if anything, is being looked at in terms of that safety data from the regulators. Is there anything of interest that they want to see or rule out? Thanks very much.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:41:17
Okay, Brian, DP.
Brian Foard
Head of General Medicines
0:41:19
Yeah, Richard, thank you so much for the question. First and foremost, I think the really strong overall growth that you've seen is really coming from all different sources of growth. If you think about it, first, our foundational indications, we continue to grow biopenetration in things like asthma, atopic dermatitis, EOE, nasal polyps. We moved into about a year ago, we launched in COPD, and we've really seen a strong success actually in COPD. One of our fastest, actually, it's our fastest respiratory indication as far as growth rate goes. That plus CSU plus BP, you can see now eight indications deep into the U.S. Our sources of growth are coming from everywhere and, of course, launching around the world. It also has actually created this really strong momentum we've seen with 26% growth this quarter and reaching over $4 billion sales.
Brian Foard
Head of General Medicines
0:42:01
As it relates to gross to net, obviously that's captured in there in reference to our sales growth. This is something that we've monitored for a long time. We see that as we go into additional sources, if you will, there are different payer groups. We obviously will provide discounts to get into different access for different patient populations. This is something we've known for a long time, and it's captured in our long-term guidance for Dupixent.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:42:24
Okay, Houman and Hebrics.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:42:26
Yeah, I'm excited to have done this acquisition, an example of our disciplined capital allocation policy. It's exciting that the preliminary data has proved so promising, superior both at Q3 and Q4 to some of the standards of care. You're correct that we're interested in the long-term extension study, which is open-label for the safety data. There is no specific, if you remember, this is a fusion protein-like antibody. There's no specific side effects we are looking for. You'll have noted from the press release that the safety and tolerability were in line with that, which was expected.

Next question from Michael Lursten from Jefferies. Michael?
Michael Leuchten
Analyst
0:43:17
Thank you very much. Two questions for François, please. One, I just wondered if I could prod you a little bit more on the seasonality comment on gross margin. You said the Dupixent process is now tucked in and you return to normal patterns. Just wondered what you meant by that. If most of the driver of the gross margin increase in Q3 still hold, just wondering why you opted not to offer an increase to guidance for this year. Thank you. Okay, thank you, François.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:43:46
Okay, Michael. As I said, the 2.5 percentage point increase that we had in our gross margin in Q3 is probably not necessarily a good proxy for 2026. I do believe that we have some factors that will stay there, like our volume growth, like, for example, even the product mix. These issues are structural, but we won't get another increase next year of 2.5 percentage points in gross margin. It will be probably closer, maybe to what I said, underlying maybe 1 percentage point benefiting from volume and product mix. The other thing in terms of guidance, I'm glad you asked the question. We do confirm our full-year guidance, which is high single-digit sales growth. Today, after nine months, we are at 8.8% year-to-date. Expect some increase from where we are at the end of September.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:44:36
Business EPS growth is low double digit, even excluding the benefit of share buyback. We are excluding share buyback at 9.9%. Expect there as well for the full year that we will go up from where we are as at the end of September. Just to clarify as well, our full-year guidance assumes basically that Q4 will be the best quarter in sales, BOI, and EPS growth this year. We will do better than we have done in any of the quarters. Q3 was a bit softer because of the comps, as we said earlier. There is just one thing I want to take the opportunity to mention. One thing, maybe what the street does not always estimate is the profit sharing with Regeneron. That includes, by the way, both Dupixent and Kevzara, because there is probably an understanding that it grows in line with sales of Dupixent. It doesn't.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:45:33
Let me just give you some further color. For example, if we look at Dupixent sales in H1, they grew by 21%, and the Regeneron profit sharing grew by 32%. So 11 percentage points faster. If I do the same analysis for Q3, Dupixent sales grew by 26%, which is remarkable, and the profit sharing with Regeneron grew by 37%. So another 11 points higher than sales. Once again, it is a profit sharing. It's not linked necessarily fully to sales, and there is about 10 to 11 points of growth in terms of difference between the two concepts.

Yeah, thank you very much for taking my questions. Florent Cespedes from Bernstein. Two quick questions, please. First, on M&A, with the massive success of Dupixent and with the mixed-use flow pipeline, maybe could it be more aggressive in terms of product acquisitions and maybe kind of Blueprint Medicines-like transactions is something that we should see in the future. A second quick question for Thomas on vaccines. Could you share with us how do you see the trend, notably in flu, with the vaccines fatigue that we observe across the world? Some color on this would be great. Thank you.
Paul Hudson

0:47:08
Maybe I didn't quite catch perfectly the first question, but it was regarding M&A and should we be doing more and more Blueprint Medicines-like is what I think I heard. François, do you want to comment?
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:47:19
Just a few words, maybe Paul, you can complete it. It's not really about being aggressive. It's about finding the relevant acquisitions. We have a space in our balance sheet. We said that we want to retain our AA rating. In order to get there, we could afford, once again, this is not necessarily what we want to do, but we could afford investing in BBN M&A currently, something like €14 billion, €15 billion and still retain our AA rating. Anyway, what we are looking for is to meet three criteria, basically: strategic fit, which is around our four therapeutic areas and possibly white spaces as well; second, scientific differentiation and relevance, and the first in class, best in class; and third, financial return as well, without any certainty. It's less a matter of amount or aggressiveness.
François-Xavier Roger

0:48:08
It's more about finding the right targets at the right time at the right price.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:48:15
Yeah, I think that's great. We've been really disciplined. You know, François, when he came in, actually went back and looked at all of our acquisitions and agreements to decide whether we allocated capital to his standard. I was somewhat relieved to find out that he did. There is a huge amount of discipline. I think, you know, you've just heard how Ayvakit's done in Q3. We're really, I think we're very good at it, but we have to be a little bit choosy about what we do. I think that's very reasonable. Okay, Thomas, vaccines.
Thomas Triomphe
Head of Vaccines
0:48:51
Thanks, François, for the question on flu. A couple of points. First of all, it's early. We're still in October. Indeed, as you had in mind with your question, I think it's fair with the first few weeks that we observe a little bit vaccination rate on the soft side when it comes to flu vaccination, particularly in the U.S. We see a soft VCR today. A couple of points, though, I'd like to highlight when it comes to the 2025 performance that you see in this quarter. First of all, we had highlighted it before, but I just want to be clear that it's linked to two elements. In Germany, there is a price effect where there is a significant price decrease due to the change of recommendation. In the U.S., it's more what you're mentioning, i.e., the soft VCR.
Thomas Triomphe
Head of Vaccines
0:49:36
In both cases, in this 2025 environment, we are keeping a very strong market share performance overall for Sanofi flu vaccines, in particular, even for differentiated flu vaccines. Beyond the performance in terms of market share, what I'd like to highlight also this quarter in terms of flu is the progress we're also making on an R&D perspective. You see that we have a positive phase three in FluZone High Dose Efluelda 50 plus extension. With the great performance you've seen with the fluidity trial and the fantastic 32% improvement compared to standard dose and fluidization, if we can extend that to people above 50 years of age, that would be fantastic. To be associated also with the progress we've made on pandemic flu, with what I think are best in class H5 seroprotection results and the move and progress we're making on flu-COVID combinations. Flu remains important for us.

Could you provide some more color on how you would characterize for AATD, both the normal range and the trough levels? Regarding net price prospects for U.S. Dupixent in 2026, since your contracting is likely largely complete at this time of the year, how would you characterize the expected net change in pricing in 2026 versus the net change in pricing in 2025?

Standard of care, by and large, doesn't get into the normal range for alpha-1 antitrypsin levels. Our Q3 and Q4 molecules provide very commendable alpha-1 antitrypsin nomogram levels, both for trough and mean dose.

Sarita Kapila

0:52:31
Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just on amlodipine, how should we think about the upcoming readouts? Is there potential for the placebo arm in the COAST2 trial to behave more normally, or should we think about it as a pure sister trial to COAST1? Just on Esteri, beyond the no plateau in efficacy that we saw in COAST1, what's underpinning the confidence that the long-term efficacy can improve with time? Thanks.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:52:59
Great questions. Okay, Houman.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:53:01
Okay, so I'll take them one at a time. Thank you for the question. Firstly, on COAST2, it's a precise replica sister study. There are some subtle differences in regional recruitment and execution, but essentially, it's a replica study. We anticipate and hope that we will get a replica of COAST1. As you'll remember, also, you said correctly on Esteri, it's a slightly more nuanced study than has perhaps been observed, as well as being able to tell us about durability ultimately in a randomized way. It will also give us a sense of dose variation that we will do. You'll remember there are multiple dose-switching arms. The punchline on Esteri, which we'll get throughout next year, is not only will it tell you about durability, but it'll tell you about the relationship between dose and durability.

Those are going to be critical in terms of our understanding of the positioning of amlodipine. Thanks.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:54:01
Okay, thank you very much, Houman. Yeah, we'll see. We'll get the data. We'll see how competitive we are. I think from a commercial perspective, we're very enthusiastic, but we'll let the data read out. Okay, next question, please.

Next question from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve?
Steve Scala
Analyst
0:54:21
Thank you so much. Two questions. Yesterday, Roche said they were taking patients back from Altuvio. What is the nature of the patient that is being taken back? What does this mean for Altuvio's long-term growth outlook? The second question is, based on the subgroup data presented at ECTRMS and the language in today's press release, it seems that any tolibrutinib SPMS approval will be in subgroups. What subgroups are likely to be in the final label? What portion of the overall SPMS market will this represent? Thank you.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:55:00
Houman, why don't you deal with that last question because we better clarify that as soon as possible?
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
0:55:04
Yeah, just to be clear, I'm going to give you two facts. The SPMS population is about 170,000, and the DPMS population is 120,000. At no point have we entertained the notion of doing subgroups. The regulatory discussions are ongoing, and we don't participate in any further insight during those regulatory discussions.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:55:28
Thank you. Brian, Altuvio.
Brian Foard
Head of General Medicines
0:55:33
Thanks, Steve, so much for the question. A couple of things. Altuvio saw another really strong quarter. It's becoming very clear to us. This is the number one switched asset. It's being switched to, we are the number one asset that's being switched to in the hemophilia marketplace in hemophilia A. We're still seeing, as we have shared before in the past, we've seen about two-thirds of our switches coming from competitors. Of that, still 10% is coming from Hemlibra. I can't really comment on what Roche shared, but what we are still seeing is 10% is coming directly from Hemlibra. We are the number one asset that is being switched to. Now, about a third of our business is still coming from a Loctate, but you can see our overall, that's starting to stabilize, and our overall HemA business is actually growing quite significantly.
Brian Foard
Head of General Medicines
0:56:17
We're very pleased with the performance and remain committed to delivering our next blockbuster this year with Altuvio.
Paul Hudson

Next question from James Kigley from Goldman Sachs. James?
James Quigley
Analyst
0:56:32
Hello, thank you for taking my questions. I've got a follow-up question for François-Xavier Roger, on the antibody payaway. I think backing out how the BOI margin seems to have been developing for Dupixent. It looks like last year it was in the region of sort of 62%. This year, third quarter, it looks like it reached 72%. If we're working backwards, maybe there's like a 92%, 93% gross margin. First of all, is that the right ballpark in terms of what we should be thinking about when calculating the payaway? As you mentioned, it seems to not necessarily be fully reflected in consensus. Going from a 72% operating margin going forward, how should we think about operating leverage? Obviously, going from last year to this year, it looks like there was a big step up. You mentioned the increase in percentage points growth for the payaway relative to Dupixent.
James Quigley
Analyst
0:57:26
Where could the margin go and how should we think about that going forward? Maybe more so, at what point could the margin peak? Secondly, maybe one for Brian Foard as well, a follow-up on Altuvio. You mentioned about taking share from other factor VIII therapies. Where are you now in terms of the factor VIII market from a market penetration and market share perspective? Where do you think you're going to end up? If that's below 100%, given the data, why would that be the case?
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:58:00
Okay, some highly specific questions. James, thank you. I think François, you'll just give a broad comment to that.
François-Xavier Roger
CFO
0:58:07
James, I would like to help you, but we don't disclose the margin by products, and we don't do it for Dupixent or for any of our products. Unfortunately, I cannot provide you any information on that. Obviously, the margin has been improving for Dupixent over time, given that we are benefiting from scale efficiencies, as I said earlier. Our margin has continued to increase.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:58:31
Okay, thank you. Brian, maybe similarly, I don't know how specific you want to be on margin.
Brian Foard
Head of General Medicines
0:58:35
Yeah, can't really get incredibly specific on that. I mean, what you see in the HemA marketplace is that you've got the factor marketplace, which is, again, as we said, where we continue to take the most business from is the factor marketplace. This is a factor therapy that obviously comes with increased efficacy. We are taking some from the non-factors, as I mentioned before, 10% coming from Hemlibra, but we don't know, we haven't shared exactly where that might end at the end of the day. As we said, we're the number one asset that is being switched to. The progress continues and we'll continue to keep you updated as it develops.
Paul Hudson
CEO
0:59:05
Okay, thank you. The last question, I think.
Operator
0:59:10
Yes, last question from Peter Verdult from BNP Exane. Peter?
Peter Verdult
Analyst
0:59:16
Yeah, hi there. Peter here from BNP Exane. Given I'm the last on the call again, maybe I'll pepper Houman with a few quick pipeline questions. Just on itopicumab, Houman, is it simply a case of the go-forward strategy that you repeat the RFI trial or will you solely be looking at the former smokers only? On FDO, data looks great. You need to gather safe data, but just on the regulatory pathway, if I recall a few years ago, FDA was making some noise about wanting to see respiratory functional endpoints as well as the biomarker analysis. Is any of that going to be required for FDO? Lastly, on TOLI, SPMS opportunity huge. How concerned or not should we be about TOLI getting an onerous label requiring weekly liver monitoring? How much of an issue would that be in your mind commercially? Thank you.
Paul Hudson
CEO
1:00:12
Okay, Peter, thank you. Last but not least. Okay, Houman.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
1:00:18
Looking forward to seeing you next week. Firstly, to start. Second, let's get into it. R33, broadly speaking, we anticipate that we will have to do some form of replicatory trial. The details of exactly what we do have been guided by both internal and external data sets. We've looked broadly, trying to understand why RFI 1 and 2 differed. The exact construction of those trials will be dependent on both discussions with our beloved partner Regeneron, but also the regulator. Look forward to more on that soon. On FDO, or as we call it internally, DORA, just to be clear, you're right that the FDA, first FDA, may have different perspectives. You'll remember that current standard of care dates to a target of 11 micromolar, which is about 50% below the limit of normal of the range. Many patients drop way below that three to five days.
Houman Ashrafian
Head of R&D
1:01:27
The first point I would make is, and we will disclose the data at a conference, the Q3 and Q4 W dosing that we have is substantially better than that. We will have a conversation with the regulator as to, A, their intrigue related to those levels, but also what other additional endpoints we'll need pursuant to both natural history data and our open-label extension safety data. On your third point, on TOLI SPMS, we're in late-stage discussions. As I said, the brief is 28th of December. While we anticipate that we'll need some sort of RAMs with TOLI, there's been no further disclosable comment on the intensity of blood draws.
Paul Hudson
CEO
1:02:22
Maybe on that last point, Houman, it's fair to say, isn't it, that we learned a lot actually between RFI 1 and RFI 2. I think you touched on that. We'll go, if you like, even better informed. On TOLI, that first 90 days of what we did in the clinical trial program and what we're doing in real life seems to be very practical and responsible. I think we're confident we have the right approach. Of course, it's the regulator that will decide what that looks like.
Paul Hudson
CEO
1:02:54
Thank you, Peter. Thank you all. Our growth momentum continued in Q3. After three quarters of sales and earnings progress, we reiterated our 2025 guidance. Our pipeline delivered important milestones in this quarter, as outlined earlier. Finally, as we're looking forward to 2026, we are confident in our ability to pursue our current trajectory of profitable growth.
Paul Hudson
CEO
1:03:19
With this, I wish everyone a good autumn. We'll now close the call. Thank you."

Please read it carefully. Now over to Guillaume.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:01:43
Thank you, Hélène, and hello ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today for our nine month 2025 results call. We're here in Amsterdam with Thomas to run you through our results. Our operating environment remains complex and dynamic. Navigating strong demands, combined with the specific supply chain tensions that have not changed, still requires continuous operational discipline and agility, in particular in the environment of changing trade policies. We welcome the U.S. EU Trade Agreement, which restores a stable and tariff-free environment for trade in aircraft and parts since the start of September. This is a crucial step that allows our global industry to move forward with the predictability it needs to invest and innovate. Yet the still unstable geopolitical situation remains an area of continuous vigilance.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:02:46
In that context, we are rolling out our plan to reach the A320 family production target of rate 75 per month by establishing 10 A321 capable final assembly lines across four global sites. The recent addition of a second line in the United States and the second line in China marks a critical milestone in our global industrial growth strategy, but also enhances our overall business resilience. We are scaling up our operations and expanding capacity as we move forward with the commercial aircraft ramp up. We are also committed to contributing to European Defence and remain focused on delivering more competitive and innovative products and services with our two divisions, and we see a growing momentum when it comes to European strategic autonomy. We have made significant progress toward the consolidation of our space activities together with Leonardo and Thales, aiming at establishing a leading European company.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:03:55
I will come to this in a minute. In Q3, we delivered 201 commercial aircraft, and as the engine situation is showing signs of recovery, the number of gliders is now at 32 as of the end of September. This brings our year to date deliveries to 507 aircraft as compared to 497 last year. Deliveries continue to be back end loaded as we navigate the engine situation. We have a strong year end rally ahead of us and our teams are in the sprint. Our EBIT adjusted stood at €4.1 billion as of nine months 2025. This reflects the commercial aircraft deliveries and the solid performance at both Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus Helicopters. Our free cash flow before customer financing was minus €0.9 billion. It notably reflects the inventory buildup that supports the Q4 deliveries and the ramp up on that basis.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:05:06
We maintain our 2025 guidance which now includes the impact of currently applicable tariffs and we'll come back to this later. Moving to space, we've made a major strategic step forward. We are very pleased with the recent announcement of signing a Memorandum of Understanding, an MOU, with Leonardo and Thales to form a new European space player in 2027. If you recall, last year I was clear we needed to focus on fixing our foundations and restore profitability. The turnaround plan is in full motion and we are pleased with the first results. In parallel, we've been working on strategic options to create scale and increase competitiveness facing global players. The new company aims to unite, enhance capabilities in space by combining the three respective activities in satellite and space systems, manufacturing, and space services. The MOU is a collective industry commitment to strengthen the European space sector.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:06:15
The next steps include launching the social consultation process with our social partners, preparing to carve out the space businesses, and addressing regulatory needs. We have a busy journey ahead and we are fully committed to this major and exciting project. Let's now look at our commercial environments, starting with commercial aircraft. Passenger traffic continued its growth momentum while air cargo demand remained resilient. During the nine months 2025 we booked 610 gross orders, including 116 in Q3. On the A220 we booked 40 gross orders and looking at the A320 family, we booked 371 gross orders. This brings our backlog to 7,105 out of which around 75% are for the A321 and the 7,105 is just for the A320 family, of course. Moving to the widebodies, on the A330 we booked 90 gross orders, confirming the high demand for these versatile products.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:07:30
Finally, on the A350 we booked 109 gross orders, underpinning the continued commercial momentum of what has become the reference in the market. Net orders amounted to 514 aircraft, including 96 cancellations which were largely anticipated and already embedded in our backlog valuation. As of December 2024, our total backlog in units stood at 8,665 aircraft at the end of September. Looking at Helicopters, in the nine months 2025 we booked 306 net orders compared to 308 in the nine months 2024. Very similar and this is well spread across the portfolio. We continue to see positive momentum in particular on the military markets, and we remain focused on securing new business opportunities in both our home countries and export markets.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:08:32
A new Airbus final assembly line will be established in India to build H125 helicopters in collaboration with Tata Advanced Systems, aiming at capturing the full potential of the civil, para, public, and military markets in South Asia. Let me conclude by highlighting that we have streamlined our small and medium tactical uncrewed aerial systems, UAS, the drones offering, into a single comprehensive portfolio managed by the Airbus Helicopters Division. This aims at delivering a focused market approach for defense and security customers and provides customers with cutting-edge capabilities for surveillance, intelligence, and operational flexibility. Finally, in Defence and Space, order intake stands at €6.8 billion for the nine months on air power. This notably reflects an order from the Royal Thai Air Force for a next-generation Airbus A330 MRTT.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:09:38
This advanced aircraft is an evolution of the combat-proven A330 MRTT, introducing innovations from the A330neo as well as upgraded military capabilities, in particular the new engine of the NEO that is now on the MRTT Plus while on air power. Let me highlight the recent contract with Germany for the acquisition of 20 Eurofighter aircraft to be produced at our final assembly line in Nanjing and to be delivered to the German Air Force starting from 2031. The order intake will be recorded once all contractual conditions are met, so the order intake is not yet recorded in Q3. The momentum for the Eurofighter is also strong on the export market outside of the home countries of the Eurofighter, and that was also demonstrated by this week's commitment from Turkey to acquire 20 units.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:10:37
The Eurodrone program is making progress as we successfully completed the CDR, the so-called critical design review, earlier this month. This officially concludes the design phase and paves the way to prototype, production, and ground tests ahead of first flight on FCAS. We remain convinced that Europe needs to have its future combatant system in order to meet its security challenges and further develop its critical skills and know-how in this field. Given the level of effort and investment required, we are convinced, I am convinced, of the benefit of a collaborative approach, and we intend to play a leading role in making it happen in a way or the other. Overall, on what concerns the Defence part of our Airbus Defence and Space and Helicopters businesses, we hope serving a growing momentum and we expect it will continue in the foreseeable future. Thomas, thank you very much.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:11:40
Now Thomas will take you through our financial.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:11:44
Guillaume and hello ladies and gentlemen. I'm now on page seven of the presentation and as Guillaume said, I will take you through our financial performance. As you can see on the chart, our nine months 2025 revenues increased to €47.4 billion, which is up 7% year on year. It mainly reflects the higher contribution from our divisions, the stronger services volumes across our businesses, and a higher level of deliveries, partially offset by the U.S. dollar depreciation. As you can see on the right hand side, our R&D expenses stood at €2.1 billion for the first nine months of the year, lower compared to the nine months of 2024. We continue to benefit from the prioritization of our activities. We now expect that the R&D expenses will be slightly lower in 2025 than in 2024 when we talk about the full year.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:12:41
Now let's look at EBIT adjusted on page 8. As you can see, our nine month 2025 EBIT adjusted increased to €4.1 billion from €2.8 billion in the nine months of 2024. Let me remind you that in the nine months of last year we recorded €989 million of charges in our space business, which obviously did not repeat themselves as of the nine months of this year. The higher commercial aircraft deliveries embed a less favorable mix, which is offset by a more favorable hedge rate and lower R&D expenses, and it also reflects a stronger performance in both divisions. Let me just clarify the impact of the currently applicable tariffs. At this point we expect this to represent anything between €100 million and €200 million for the full year, of which, however, the vast majority will be recorded in Q4.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:13:40
As you can see on the right hand side of the page, the level of EBIT adjustments totaled a net negative €0.8 billion. I'll just walk you through the items: it has in it negative €577 million impact from the dollar working capital mismatch and the balance sheet revaluation, mainly reflecting the mechanical impact coming from the difference between transaction date and delivery date, of which negative €186 million occurred in Q3. Secondly, it has negative €105 million related to the Airbus Defence and Space restructuring, which we recorded already in Q1, and it has negative €88 million related to the stabilization of certain Spirit AeroSystems work packages, of which €31 million recorded in Q3, and finally negative €11 million other including compliance costs and also Moda. This takes our nine months 2025 EBIT reported to positive €3.4 billion and the financial result was positive €374 million.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:14:47
It mainly reflects the revaluation of certain equity investments and the revaluation of financial instruments, partially offset by the evolution of the U.S. dollar. The tax rate on the core business continues to be at around 27%. However, the effective tax rate is 32.4% including the tax effect on the revaluation of certain equity investments as well as a net deferred tax assets impairment. We still expect the French surtax to result in an impact of around €300 million in 2025 both for P&L and cash. In the nine months of this year, we recorded the part that is related to the year 2024 as well as the part corresponding to the first nine months of this year. The resulting net income is €2.6 billion with earnings per share reported of €3.34 as you can see on the chart.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:15:46
The nine months 2025 EPS adjusted stood at 3 based on an average of 790 million shares. Now, with this, let's turn the page to page nine and look at our U.S. dollar exposure coverage. Consistent with what we said during our business update, we began to implement a limited number of zero cost collars, exactly $2.1 billion in the quarter into our hedge portfolio. The $2.1 billion is dollars, not euros obviously. This strategy aims at addressing the longer term horizon with an acceptable level of volatility and to potentially capture the favorable evolution of the U.S. dollar while at the same time being protected against a material weakening of the dollar.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:16:36
Let me just be clear, we do not aim at replacing our forwards, but rather to complement our coverage with a limited amount of collars and as indicated the collars will at this stage remain at around a single digit % of the overall. With the integration of collars, the blended rate now includes the least favorable rate of our collars and so hence it provides you with a protected or conservative view. With all that being said, as you can see on the page, in the nine months of 2025, $14.8 billion of forwards matured with the associated EBIT impact and euro conversions realized at a blended rate of $1.18 versus $1.21 in the nine months of 2024. We also implemented $12.7 billion of new coverage at a blended rate of $1.18. As a result, our total U.S. dollar coverage portfolio in U.S.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:17:38
dollar stands at $80.7 billion with an average blended weight of $1.21 as compared to $82.8 billion at $1.21 at the end of 2024. Now let's look at our free cash flow on page 10. Our free cash flow before customer financing was negative $0.9 billion in the first nine months of the year. As you can see on the chart, this outflow was mainly driven by the change in working capital and it notably reflects the planned inventory build up to support our ramp up across our businesses. It also includes a favorable phasing effect of cash receipts and payments on the A400M. The aircraft slightly weighted negatively on our free cash flow in the nine months of 2025 as the deliveries of the aircraft are back end loaded.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:18:35
However, we continue to expect it to be broadly neutral from a free cash flow perspective in the full year 2025. As you can also see on the chart, the nine month CapEx number was negative €2.3 billion and we continue to expect it to increase in 2025 to support our industrial ramp up so that the free cash flow was negative €0.8 billion including customer financing of a positive €0.1 billion. What we can say is that the aircraft financing environment remains strong and competitive and we expect sufficient liquidity to finance our 2025 deliveries. Our net cash position stood at €7 billion as at the end of September, also reflecting the dividend payment as well as the weakening dollar environment. I should stress that our liquidity remains very strong at around €30 billion.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:19:32
In September, as you might have noticed, Moody's upgraded our credit rating to A1 with a stable outlook and we think this is underlining our consistent strong credit management and the strength of our balance sheet. With that, I would like to hand it back to Guillaume.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:19:50
Thank you, Thomas. Very clear. Now let's start with commercial aircraft. In the nine months 2025, we delivered 507 aircraft to 79 customers. Looking at the situation by aircraft family, on narrowbodies, we delivered 62 A220s and 392 A320s. Out of the 392 A320 family aircraft, 250 were A321s, representing 64% of the deliveries for the A320 family. We are very pleased that Air New Guinea has taken delivery of its first A220, becoming the 25th global operator of the aircraft, which is now flying with carriers on five continents. The A320 family reached a major milestone, becoming the most delivered airliner in history. There's a bit of pride here, as you can see, and we continue to ramp up towards a rate of 75 A320 family aircraft per month in 2027. That's no change compared to previous assumptions.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:21:03
On the A220, the current balance between supply and demand has led to an adjustment of the ramp-up trajectory and the ramp-up ahead of us. We are now targeting to reach rate 12 in 2026, allowing time for the integration of the Spirit AeroSystems work packages, mostly the wings, and the progressive introduction of engine durability improvements for our customers. This means more work to reach breakeven, and our team are actually on it. In the nine months, we delivered 53 widebodies, of which 20 A330s and 33 A350s. On the A330, we're currently stabilizing at a monthly production rate of 4 as previously introduced. We are now targeting to reach rate 5 in 2029 to meet the customer demand for the A330. On the A350, there's no change. We continue to target the rate 12 in 2028.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:22:15
When it comes to the A350 freighter, I'm pleased to say that we started the assembly of the first flight test aircraft in Toulouse, with the first flight planned next year. In a nutshell, we continue to produce in line with the plan. The challenges for the year have not changed, notably with cabin and for the A320, the persisting tensions on engines, resulting in 32 gliders at the end of September. The engine situation is showing signs of recovery, and we continue to work closely with the engine manufacturers to deliver on our 2025 commitments. Now let's look at the financials for our commercial aircraft business. Revenues increased 3% year on year, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries and growth in services. EBITDA adjusted was at €3.33 billion in the nine months, driven by favorable hedges rate and slightly lower R&D expenses.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:23:19
While the increase of deliveries embeds an unfavorable mix. Looking at Helicopters, in the nine months we delivered 218 helicopters, 28 more than at nine months of 2024. Revenues increased around 16% to €5.7 billion, reflecting a solid performance from programs and services growth. EBIT adjusted increased to €495 million, reflecting growth in services as well as higher deliveries. As I mentioned earlier, let's complete our review with Defence and Space. Revenues increased 17% year on year to €8.9 billion, driven by higher volumes across all business lines. EBIT adjusted stood at €420 million, supported by higher volumes and improved profitability, in line with the divisional mid term trajectory. On the A400M program, we engage in positive and forward-looking discussions with the launch nations and OCCAR.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:24:33
This was notably marked by the agreement reached in June with OCCAR to advance seven deliveries for France and Spain and to further increase the visibility we have on the production for the program. In light of uncertainties regarding the level of aircraft orders, Airbus continues to assess the potential impact on the program's manufacturing activities. Risks on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs remain stable. Now on to our guidance, which as you have seen, is maintained. On the basis of its 2025 guidance, the company assumes no additional disruptions to global trade or to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the company's internal operations and its ability to deliver products and services. The guidance now includes the impact of currently applicable tariffs.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:25:33
The guidance also includes the impact of the integration of certain Spirit AeroSystems work packages based on preliminary estimates and an assumed closing in the fourth quarter of 2025. On that basis, the company targets to achieve in 2025 around 820 commercial aircraft deliveries, an EBIT adjusted of around €7 billion. We're not yet there, and the free cash flow before customer financing of around €4.5 billion. Just to clarify my statement on EBIT, we target an EBIT adjusted of around €7 billion. The anticipated impact of the integration of certain Spirit AeroSystems work packages on the company's guidance remains broadly in line with previous estimates. Maybe, Thomas, you want to be more precise on some of those elements?
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:26:37
Yes, let me just add a couple of precisions and details to what you said, Guillaume. First of all, on tariffs, as I said earlier, we expect this to represent anything between $102 million and $200 million for the full year. The vast majority of the total amount will be recorded in Q4. Secondly, on Spirit AeroSystems, when we say broadly in line, what we mean is that the closing date is now expected before the end of the year and all parties are putting all necessary efforts into the closing process. This is on track for the operational readiness for day one. Of course, it is later than what we had anticipated at the beginning of this year when we put out the guidance.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:27:24
This shift of the closing into Q4 comes with a partial relief to free cash flow because we didn't own the business and therefore we did not record any negative operational result in our free cash flow. On the other hand, you have also seen in our financial statements that we provided credit lines to Spirit which are recorded below the free cash flow line. In total, this remains broadly neutral in terms of the net cash position for the company. Everything else being equal, you could take this slight free cash flow positive adjustment in the range of a low triple digit number into your models if you want, but obviously the order of magnitude is not such that it led us to change the guidance. With that, back to Guillaume.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:28:12
Thank you, Thomas, for those precisions. I'll conclude with our key priorities, and they have not changed. We are and we remain fully committed to executing the next steps of our commercial aircraft production ramp up together with our suppliers. Our focus is twofold: addressing the remaining specific supply chain tensions, in particular on narrow body engines where durability remains a headwind as well as cabin, while also preparing the integration of the key Spirit AeroSystems work packages. As we focus on our production goals, we're also maturing the critical technologies that will define the successor of the A320 family, in line with our ambition to pioneer the next generation of commercial aircraft. When it comes to Airbus Defence and Space, we are progressing on our transformation and contributing to establishing a European space leader. On European defence, the industry is clearly in motion.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:29:13
We are embracing this challenge by leveraging the combined expertise of our Defence and Space and Helicopters divisions to drive scale and cooperation in Europe. Now let's turn to your questions in the Q&A.
Hélène Le Gorgeu
Head of Investor Relations
0:29:30
Thank you, Guillaume. Thank you, Thomas. We will now start our Q and A session. Please introduce yourself and your company. When asking a question, please limit yourself to two questions at a time and this includes sub questions also. As usual, please remember to speak clearly and slowly in order to help all participants, particularly of self, to understand your question. Sharon, please go ahead and explain the procedure for the participants.
Operator
0:30:01
Thank you, Hélène. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star 11 on your telephone keypad. That is Star 11 to ask a question. We will now go to our first question. Our first question today comes from the line of Benjamin Heelan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:30:33
Ben, we don't hear you.
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director of Equity Research
0:30:35
Can you hear me now?
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:30:39
Yes,
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director of Equity Research
0:30:40
yes, sorry about that. First question was on the margin. Margin I think in Q3 looks pretty positive. Could you just talk through some of the drivers? It looks to me as though very positive mix in commercial. Any comments there would be helpful. Thank you.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:31:00
Ben, I think we're repeating ourselves a little bit when we say that the margin of a single quarter should not be overestimated or overinterpreted. I would say the margin in commercial indeed was, let's say, positive. That does not necessarily come from the mix. The mix was actually not specifically helping us in Q3, but it was more driven by, let's say, cost discipline in terms of SG&A, R&D, where the lead program that we have started is now really showing its full effect. We're pretty pleased with, I would say, the efficiency that the company has shown over the course of the year and specifically in Q3. The things that we have done are not, let's say, of short-term nature, but we expect them, that we can actually keep them in our trajectory.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:31:54
Secondly, I would say in Defence and Space, all divisions are showing a good performance. There are two drivers for it. One, that our improvement program for Space is actually showing good effects and we're very pleased with the results that we see, not only in terms of measures that they take, but first outcome, which is rather better than what we had expected. Secondly, as Guillaume pointed out, a good momentum in Defence in general where we see not only good order intake but also, let's say, good margins for the first nine months of the year. I would not specifically point to the mix but rather some self-help measures and operational discipline that are helping.
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director of Equity Research
0:32:37
Okay, thank you. And then a follow on. I know you won't give us a delivery number for 2026 today, but are there any building blocks that you can provide to point us broadly in the direction of where we should be headed for next year from a delivery perspective in commercial? Thank you.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:32:57
I would say not more today than what you know already in terms of ramp up trajectory for the A320. The A330 and the A350 has changed, as you have seen on what we target for next year on the A220 where we target to reach rate 12 instead of rate 14. Nothing new on that horizon except this slight modification on the A220 and we'll be targeting rate 5 for the A330 a bit later.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:33:28
That's basically a lot of stability in the ramp up trajectory compared to what we had shared earlier in the year. Cool.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:33:38
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator
0:33:40
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Perry from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Perry
Equity Research Analyst
0:33:49
Yes. Hi, good evening, Guillaume and Thomas. Two quick ones from me just on this tariff impact, Thomas, if it all falls in Q4, do we annualize that impact going forward? On space, can you just clarify exactly what you're putting in? Unless I'm mistaken, I think you're putting a little bit more than just the manufacturing business. Maybe I've misunderstood on that and maybe any other comments you want to make in terms of like, is this going to have a meaningful impact on the ADS margin going forward, this transaction, are you making any equalization payments or receiving any? Thank you.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:34:31
On the two questions, the tariff impact, let me repeat what I said. The total full year impact will be between $100 million and $200 million. Why is the majority of that occurring in Q4? The material that we have shipped, that is necessary, has already been shipped into the U.S. We hold it as work in progress so that we will only record the impact of the tariffs once the material is actually built into the aircraft and the aircraft is sold. Therefore, to your question, you should not annualize the Q4 effect. It's a specific impact of this year, where a lot of the pre-September 1 effects are currently captured in our WIP and will then only materialize when the aircraft is delivered. That is the mechanic behind it. On your second question, if I understood correctly, you're referring to Bromo. What are we bringing into that corporation?
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:35:37
Two businesses, essentially our space services business, which is currently mainly in CI, and our space systems business, which is also a subdivision of Defence and Space. Obviously, what has nothing to do with it is the launcher business, which is completely separate, but we're bringing in both services and space systems.
David Perry
Equity Research Analyst
0:36:02
Okay, does the transaction have a big impact on the future margin of Airbus?
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:36:10
I mean, we do expect that there will be mid triple digit synergies five years after the closing of the transaction. I would say in the medium term it should be clearly accretive to the margin. We will then hold a 35% stake in something which is more efficient and more profitable than what we have today. Let's be honest, in the very short term, I would not put in a big impact in the models that you probably have.
David Perry
Equity Research Analyst
0:36:39
Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
0:36:42
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ross Law from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:36:51
Hi, evening. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one on your full year delivery guidance, given that the engine suppliers have.
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:36:59
Essentially said that they're getting you the.
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:37:00
Engines that you need, what are the main challenges or bottlenecks outstanding from here into year end, and then looking ahead to 2026, obviously engines seemingly becoming less of an issue compared to 2024 and 2025, supply chain overall performing better. Is there any reason why you won't.
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:37:18
Be able to deliver a double digit.
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:37:19
Increase in deliveries in 2026, which is.
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:37:22
A growth rate you previously referred to?
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:37:23
Thanks.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:37:24
Maybe I take the questions. When it comes to 2025 and the full year around 820 aircraft, the main challenge is the volume of aircraft that remains to be delivered in the fourth quarter. What we will have to deliver in the last month is indeed quite unprecedented. We are not yet at the point where we will have all what we need to secure all deliveries. We are still expecting engines in the weeks to come that will support some 2025 deliveries. The main challenge is indeed volume backloading of the year and making sure that there's no mishap or no challenge ahead of us that would postpone aircraft and cross the line of the end of 2025. A lot of work. The supply chain and the engine situation looks like we're going to make it. Again, still a lot on our plate about the engine tensions.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:38:38
They will persist. There is indeed a bigger backdrop of airlines needing more engines for their in-service aircraft on the Pratt & Whitney side, but as well on the CFM side. The engine makers need to continue to ramp up the production of parts and engines to serve both the aircraft manufacturers and their airline and lessor customers. We are not out of the woods when it comes to tension on engine availability. We think we will have what we need for the trajectory we have sketched out for 2026. Again, we are not at the point of guiding for 2026.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:39:32
I confirm and I maintain what I said earlier, we are consistent with the ramp-up trajectory that we have given previously this year and next year, namely reaching the rate 75 on the A320 in 2027, the rate 12 on the A350 in 2028, and the rate 5 on the A330 in 2029 as far as I remember. Only change, A220 slightly lower rate for next year. We are in the steep ramp-up on the A220 and we now target to reach the rate 12 for next year, which is still a very steep ramp-up. We believe this is the best balance between the different constraints we have next year and a lot of work actually on the A220 to get there by next year, including the integration of the wings and other work packages that will come from the integration of Spirit AeroSystems.
Ross Law
European Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:40:30
Okay, thanks Kio.
Operator
0:40:35
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Clara Mary from Jefferies, please go ahead.
Chloé Lemarié
Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:40:42
Yes, good evening, Guillaume, Thomas and Hélène. Thank you for taking my question. The first one would be on the maintain guide. It looks fairly conservative for Q4 given the expected delivery growth. I understand tariffs are a headwind, but any other moving part you'd like to share to help us understand the building blocks for the Q4 year on year? The second one, I think Guillaume, you commented on the press call about gliders being half of what they were. Could you just clarify whether this is at end Q3 or more recently and maybe compare and contrast the situation between the LEAP and GTF powered aircraft, please. Thank you.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:41:26
Maybe I start with the guidance and remain to do so starting from the $4.1 billion as of the nine months. Last year we did $2.6 billion in Q4 of last year. I would say there's clearly a positive effect from the volume. You can attach roughly half a billion to it if all the deliveries materialize. I would say there's at least two headwinds. One is the tariffs and secondly, R&D. We're expecting that R&D will be slightly lower than last year, but that still could mean that in Q4 R&D would be higher than last year. That is a headwind that you should have on your list. On the other hand, I do believe that the two divisions, Helicopters and Defence and Space, could be performing positively and that would be then positive. If you take those together, that would bring me then to the around seven.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:42:31
It all hinges on the deliveries. As Guillaume said, it's a very, very steep ramp up. The teams are on it and if we make the deliveries, obviously, then I think the financial numbers should clearly be in sync with it.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:42:46
Thank you, Thomas. When it comes to the question on gliders, we stood at 60 gliders by end of Q2, and we stood at 50, 32 gliders by end of Q3, so by end of September, roughly a month ago. The situation obviously is dynamic as we are targeting to be with zero gliders by the end of the year. As I said earlier, we still need to receive engines in the weeks to come to be fully sure that we will have what we need. Engine manufacturers have confirmed that they will deliver what we need to reach that objective of zero glider and reaching our guidance. When it comes to the situation, Leap versus GTF, actually it's both. As we speak, it's shared between the two engine manufacturers and can't be precise enough.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:43:49
It's not far from balanced between the two, not far from 50%, 50% between Leap and GTF. Again, it's a dynamic situation almost by the day as we deliver a lot of aircraft those weeks. I can't be more precise than this at this very moment.
Chloé Lemarié
Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:44:09
Very clear. Thank you.
Operator
0:44:12
Thank you. We will now take the next question. The question comes from the line of Sam Burgess from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Samuel Burgess
Head of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research
0:44:23
Great. Thank you, Guillaume and Thomas, for taking the question. A couple from me. Thomas, can we just circle back on R&D? From memory, your initial expectation was R&D would be a bit above 2024 levels. I might have missed it, but what specifically is driving this trimming of R&D versus your initial expectations? Is that kind of sustainable going forward or do we get some catch up in FY2? The second question, I know you don't want to dwell too much on individual quarters, but in your press release you do explicitly mention a less favorable mix on deliveries year to date. Do you expect that mix to become more favorable in Q4? Thank you.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:45:09
On R&D, we have roughly $200 million below the 2024 numbers for the first nine months of the year. If I'm not mistaken, that is mainly a function of our lead improvement program, where we're focusing on the things that really matter, but have the courage to also terminate some projects where we think they're simply not yielding the results that we feel they should. That means less external consultants, that means less spending on all kinds of things. It's not trimming R&D, as you said it, with a lawnmower approach, but it's really very specific and focused with the program where we think let's focus on the things that matter most to the company. That was pretty successful in our view.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:45:57
Therefore, while admittedly we said at the beginning of the year that we would expect R&D to slightly increase, we're now of the view that with the successes that we have, which we think are sustainable, we should be slightly below previous year for the full year. That still means that in Q4, as I said in my previous answer, there might be a slight increase in R&D. Now going forward, what is unchanged is that we do expect R&D to increase in line with revenue. As a percentage of revenue, I think you should keep it constant in your model. Of course, starting from a somewhat lower base in 2025 and then on the mix, it's simply a function that we have delivered more A220s and you know that they have a lower margin than the best.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:46:45
It's just a function of all the ramp ups and the numbers that we have given you.
Samuel Burgess
Head of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research
0:46:51
Great, that's very helpful.
Samuel Burgess
Head of Aerospace and Defense Equity Research

0:46:55
Thank you. Your next question today comes from the line of Ian Douglas-Pennant from UBS. Please go ahead.
Ian Douglas-Pennant
Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:47:05
Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. The first is another on the supply chain. Aside from engines and the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems being delayed, are there any other pain points that you'd like to call out in the supply chain that are causing the changes to the schedules that you've talked about today or elsewhere? Secondly, we've seen a number of A320neos being retired this year. I wonder, do you have any comments on why that might be happening, how sustainable you think, whether they are, you know, edge cases or how we should interpret some very young aircraft being retired. Thank you.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:47:47
On the supply chain, of course, the main area of attention and concern are engines. As we mentioned earlier, the rest of the supply chain is actually doing much better than in 2024 and previous years. I mean, significantly better.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:48:07
The number of missing parts and the depth of delays is significantly better than it was before. We continue to have issues and delays on cabin equipment, interiors, seats, and that's probably more of a midterm issue than a short term one given the fact that this part of the industry has been since COVID or since the recovery after COVID, sort of overwhelmed by the combination of demand for new aircraft and retrofit and extension of the life of products. When it comes to your question on the retirement of A320neo, I'm a bit surprised that's not what I have in mind maybe there's a confusion with aircraft being on the ground because of missing engines, in particular on the Pratt & Whitney side. That's not something that is consistent with what I have in mind. Not retirement of aircraft as much as I know.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:49:09
We look at your question.
Operator
0:49:14
Thank you. We will now go to the next question. The next question comes from the line of Douglas Hannah from Bernstein, please go ahead.
Douglas Harned
Senior Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:49:30
Good evening. Thank you. The first question is if you could update us on the A350. It looks like deliveries may be a little bit better in October, but this has been very slow. Maybe you could update us on progress with Spirit AeroSystems with interiors related to the A350 and getting those rates up. The second question is now we've heard some cautious comments from CFM on getting out to 75 a month, particularly most recently from Safran. Where do you stand now in working with the engine providers on ensuring that you can get to that 75 a month at some point, hopefully by the end of 2026.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:50:21
On the A350, we continue to believe we will be consistent with what we have indicated so far, meaning that the ramp up has been sort of the start of the ramp up on the A350 has been sort of delayed by a year given the challenges and the difficulties we had with the section 15 of Spirit AeroSystems. We don't expect an increase compared to 2024 in 2025, but there is indeed a phasing and a quite significant level of backloading in deliveries in 2025. The ramp up then comes later and we think we'll catch up in the sense of maintaining reaching the rate 12 by 2028. We are mostly challenged by difficulties and delays on interiors, on lavatories, on seats. That's mainly what we're suffering from on the A350 and it's not different compared to previous quarters and even compared to 2024.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:51:33
Unfortunately, when it comes to the ramp up of the A320, actually CFM is in line with us and has confirmed regularly that they are in line with us on the need for rate 75 on the ramp up trajectory. I'm slightly surprised with the remark because the level of alignment with CFM is very strong. They had significant issues this year that has led to a lot of gliders and delays in delivering their engines. They're catching up and again I'm comfortable that they will be back to where they have to be by end of this year to then deliver on the ramp up trajectory to support us in 2026, 2027 till we reach the rate 75. I'm not suggesting they don't have their challenges. I don't know what was the nature of the comment precisely.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:52:27
They have their challenges, obviously, but we are moving hand in hand when it comes to ramping up the A320 with the CFM engine. At least that's my current perception and that's consistent with the last weeks and months, meetings and interactions with CFM.
Douglas Harned
Senior Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:52:43
Very good. Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Herbert
Senior Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:52:58
Yes, hi, good evening. Guillaume, Thomas and Hélène. I wanted to pivot and ask about the A220 if I could. The lower guidance for deliveries still seems relatively ambitious considering sort of where you are today on that program. Can you talk more about challenges with that ramp and what gives you incremental confidence? Still at the 12 a month in 2026. As a second part, there continues to be speculation about maybe a third variant of that program. How do you view the investments in that and the potential return on that program considering what seems to be a more challenging ramp and some incremental comments about some demand pressure.
Kenneth Herbert
Senior Aerospace and Defense Research Analyst
0:53:45
Thank you.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:53:47
Yes, thank you for the question. Indeed, we are in a steep ramp up for the A220. The team has a lot on the plate, and now they have on top to integrate the wings and other work packages of the A220. That's indeed a lot of work to get to where we want to be. We think the rate 12 for next year is a good balance between the different challenges and the demand and supply situation and the quantity of work to be delivered. It's still a significant ramp up, but what we learned from this year is that a rate 12 for next year, reaching rate 12 next year, actually is something we believe is well in the cards. Basically, that's all about the quantity of work, all what needs to be achieved, the ramp up.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:54:43
In both Mirabel and Mobile, we have two files, the number of variants, different configurations that we have to deliver, and industrial optimization to be able to accelerate the pace of production to that level. When it comes to the third variant, which is also nicknamed the Dash 500, the first two variants being the Dash 100 and the Dash 350, that's something we believe the program will need and benefit from. We have demand from airlines and from the airline customers for these variants that on paper looks really as a very competitive product. We have said that the Dash 500 is not a question of if, but is a question of when. We're still with the same type of statements.

Again, we're giving priority to the short term work and the short term challenges that we have to perform: the ramp up, to move forward, to break even with the program, to digest the Spirit AeroSystems work package that will be now under our responsibility. That's the way we're looking at the year and the years ahead of us.

Thank you. We will now take our final question for today. The final question comes from the line of Olivier Brochet from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.
Olivier Brochet
Senior Equity Research Analyst
0:56:20
Yes, good evening, Guillaume and Thomas. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is very simple. On tariffs. You mentioned a number. Should we think of the impact on gas to be similar for 2025 and 2026, please? Second, on space, on accounting and the deconsolidation that you might be doing. Should we think of a deconsolidation? Will it lead to some separation costs, please?
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:56:55
The second question is too difficult and the first one as well, so I hand over to Thomas.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:57:04
The first one obviously is easy for me, the answer is yes. I mean, roughly, the EBIT and the cash impact is the same. You can put that into your model on the space consolidation. What we have to do is go from a Memorandum of Understanding to signing and then from signing to closing. Closing means in order to be ready for that, we have to carve out the business. Currently the business is spread over many legal entities and countries. To your question, yes, we do have the task as Airbus to create an operationally and legally standalone separate business until 2027, which can then be put into the new legal entity that will come with, not insignificant, let's say, separation costs. We said, however, in the statement on Bromo that they would be in line with industry standards.
Thomas Toepfer
CFO
0:58:04
I think you can plug in a normal number into your models, but it's not insignificant, given the size of it for 2025. That will not have an impact on our financial results.
Olivier Brochet
Senior Equity Research Analyst
0:58:20
That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator
0:58:25
Thank you, Guillaume. Thank you, Thomas. This now closes our conference call for today. If you have any further questions, please send an email to Olivier, Victoria, or myself and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
Guillaume Faury
CEO
0:58:40
Hélène, I'd like to announce to the audience that you will actually move to new challenges still in the Financial Directorate of Airbus under the leadership of Thomas in the Commercial Aircraft team. You will have Jean-Christophe Heinou as a successor. Jean-Christophe is joining from the Strategic team and will take over on December 1. Very soon we will have JC, nicknamed JC, with us. Hélène, I would like to thank you very warmly for the pleasure working with you, for the quality and the precision of all you've been doing with us, for your constant voice on the calls, and for your very good availability with all our investors and analysts and all the financial community. I wish you, we wish you, with Thomas, all the best moving forward to your new job.
Guillaume Faury
CEO

Thank you, Operator. We would like to welcome all of you to Woodward's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 earnings call. In today's call, Chip will comment on our strategies and related markets. Bill will then discuss our financial results as outlined in our earnings release. At the end of our presentation, we will take questions. For those who have not seen today's earnings release, you can find it on our website at woodward.com. We have included some presentation materials to go along with today's call that are also accessible on the website. Please note that based on changes in market dynamics, the company has refined its industrial end-to-market presentation to better align certain sales within power generation, transportation, and oil and gas. Accordingly, sales for the quarters and years ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 have been reclassified for comparability.
Dan Provaznik
Director of Investor Relations
0:01:40
The reclassification had no impact on total industrial or the consolidated financial results. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for one year. All references to years in this call are references to the company's fiscal year unless otherwise stated. I would like to highlight our cautionary statement as shown on slide two of the presentation materials. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking, including our guidance, and are based on our current outlook and assumptions for the global economy and our businesses more specifically. Those elements can and do frequently change. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties surrounding those elements, including the risks we identify in our filings with the SEC. These statements are made as of today, and we do not intend to update them except as required by law. In addition, we are providing certain non-U.S.

GAAP financial measures. We direct your attention to the reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, which are included in today's slide presentation and our earnings release. We believe this additional financial information will help in understanding our results. I will now turn the call over to Chip.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:03:03
Thank you, Dan. 2023 was another remarkable year for Woodward. Our team continues to make significant progress, motivated by our purpose to design and deliver energy control systems that our partners count on to power a clean future. Our members' dedication to serving our customers and meeting our commitments to all stakeholders drove record performance in a number of areas. Our annual revenue exceeded $3.5 billion for the first time, which was the result of strong performance in both business segments. Aerospace sales increased 14% to record levels, with margin expansion of 290 basis points. Industrial delivered healthy sales growth of approximately 10%, excluding China OH, and core industrial margin expansion of 110 basis points. As a result, we delivered all-time high adjusted earnings per share, up nearly 13% compared to the prior year.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:04:11
We achieved these results through a keen focus on our strategy, guided by our values, including integrity, respect and accountability, and showing up as humble yet driven industry leaders as we continue to improve how Woodward serves customers. Next, I'd like to highlight some notable achievements that created value from last year, driven by our pillars of growth, operational excellence, and innovation. Starting with growth, our aerospace team delivered strong growth in defense OEM as predicted and rose to the occasion to deliver on higher-than-expected commercial services demand. Commercial aircraft delivery rates were lower than originally planned, including impacts of destocking of some Woodward components and systems. In commercial services, our team successfully captured volume growth and pricing opportunities.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:05:08
We experienced more legacy engine MRO volume than planned, coupled with the expected increase in LEAP and GTF demand, which is rising to levels of significant contribution to overall commercial services revenue and earnings. We expect LEAP and GTF repair revenue to surpass legacy repair revenue in late calendar 2026 or early 2027. For this compare, I'm speaking specifically to the repair activity and excluding spare LRU sales associated with fleet spares provisioning, as these sales can be lumpy over short periods of time but generally correlate with total aircraft delivered over the long term. For example, this past quarter, we received more orders for spare end items than we anticipated, with trade and tariff uncertainty contributing to the order surge. Our industrial segment delivered double-digit growth in oil and gas and power generation and high single-digit growth in marine transportation.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:06:19
Notably, our industrial services portfolio, ranging from component MRO to power plant controls upgrade projects, achieved substantial growth, contributing to top-line sales and improved mix. Overall, our strong performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2025 reflects the strength of our strategy and our team's ability to execute. We have increased content on growing platforms and growing markets, and we believe we are well-positioned for future success. Over the past year, we achieved several key milestones supporting our long-term growth strategy. We completed a strategic transaction to add capability and pedigree to our electromechanical actuation business unit. The acquisition included state-of-the-art horizontal stabilizer trim actuator products on business jet, regional, and wide-body commercial aircraft, including the Airbus A350. This represents our first direct supply contract to Airbus. Integration of the acquired people and products is progressing on plan to capture the full value of the transaction.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:07:33
We won a competitive selection to design and deliver A350 wing spoiler actuators, further increasing our Airbus business portfolio and A350 ship set content. This organic growth project proves our position on a very successful wide-body program, as well as prepares us for the next single aisle opportunity by demonstrating our technology, design, and industrialization capability. This win, coupled with our recent acquisition of electromechanical actuation capability, including the A350 HSTA, will raise our total A350 ship set value to approximately $550,000 once we start shipping the wing spoiler actuators, currently scheduled for late calendar 2028. To that end, we broke ground on our Spartanburg, South Carolina facility construction project in November. This facility is intended to be another showcase advanced manufacturing site, building on our experience with our Rock Cut campus, highly automated and vertically integrated. We will produce the A350 spoiler plus additional aerospace products at this facility.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:08:53
Within industrial, our Glotton expansion is ahead of schedule and on track to become operational by mid-2026. This expansion will provide increased capacity to meet the growing demand for data center backup power with enhanced levels of automation, improved flow, and higher inventory turns. To support our growth, we're making increased strategic investments in our company with robust returns for projects that increase capacity and improve productivity with a specific focus on automation. Turning to operational excellence, we continue to make steady progress. We are focused on improving the fundamentals, and I expect our teams to pick up the pace to improve flow and unlock more productivity in this coming year. Everything starts with safety at Woodward.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:09:45
We continue to roll out our human and organizational performance program to reduce injury risks and increase levels of protection, and we are on track to have HOP in place at all of our sites this calendar year. We're also investing in immersive training for our team leads and first-level supervisors. We are starting to see the benefits as they apply what they've learned, solving problems within cycle time, rebalancing work to optimize labor and create flow, and coaching their teams more effectively. I'm excited by our progress so far. We're also making strides in stabilizing our supply chain. Although we are still experiencing some supplier performance shortfalls, Woodward has made progress in optimizing our supplier network while helping our strategic suppliers improve their own quality and delivery when required. Industry-wide efforts to stabilize demand signals are benefiting our planning and delivery performance.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:10:47
I'm pleased to see our investments in automation paying off by reducing our demand for labor. We're also realizing the expected benefits in safety, quality, delivery, and cost as we refine our project execution and rebalance value streams. Our automation focus is on jobs with high turnover, repetitive or ergonomically challenged tasks, and high applied force requirements. Our workforce is embracing these projects and understands the benefit in their daily work. We will continue to invest in automation in 2026 and beyond. Innovation is alive and well at Woodward, and we made prudent investments in technology development for new military programs, the next single aisle, alternative fuels, automation, and services delivery. We continue partnering with our customers to shape how our technology solutions can elevate the value of their next-generation products.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:11:46
As we look ahead, our priorities for 2026 are centered on strong execution, including capturing continued growth in our markets, driving operational excellence, and meeting our customers' evolving expectations. In aerospace, we are prepared for increased OEM orders as the aircraft manufacturers stabilize and increase production rates, and as defense customers continue to signal strong demand. In commercial services, we are prepared for MRO growth as legacy aircraft continue to fly longer and more LEAP and GTF engines enter their maintenance cycles. We do expect somewhat muted top-line growth in commercial services compared to 2025, which benefited from outsized demand for spare end items and some advanced buying. In industrial, we are ready to meet sustained demand across our core markets of transportation, power generation, and oil and gas, and continue to expand our capabilities and global presence in industrial regional repair, overhaul, and upgrade offerings.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:12:55
Our guidance for 2026 reflects our continued confidence in the growth trajectory across our segments and our continued operational discipline. We are on track to deliver the three-year sales and earnings targets we set at December 2023 Investor Day. We do expect a modest adjustment to our cumulative free cash flow target as we make the strategic decision to allocate more capital toward organic, high-return growth investments, including automation at multiple sites and the Spartanburg facility. 2025 was a year of record performance and significant progress as we executed on our strategy and delivered on the commitments we've made to shareholders. We intend to build on the strong momentum in 2026 and beyond. Now I'll turn it over to Bill to share more detail around our financial performance in 2025 and our outlook for 2026. Ready, Bill?
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:13:55
I'm ready. Thank you, Chip. Good evening, everyone. As a reminder, all references to years are references to the company's fiscal year unless otherwise stated, and all comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2025 totaled $995 million and increased by 16%. Net sales for 2025 were $3.6 billion, an increase of 7%, and the highest on record. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2025 were $2.23 compared to $1.36. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2025 were $2.09 compared to $1.41. For 2025, earnings per share were $7.19 compared to $6.01, and adjusted earnings per share were $6.89 compared to $6.11. At the segment level, our aerospace segment delivered double-digit sales growth and substantial earnings expansion for both the fourth quarter and full year, driven by strong performance in commercial services and defense OEM.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:15:24
Fourth quarter aerospace segment sales were $661 million, up 20%. Commercial services sales increased 40%, while commercial OEM sales were essentially flat. Defense OEM sales increased 27%, and defense services were up 8%. Aerospace segment earnings for the fourth quarter were $162 million, with margins expanding 520 basis points to 24.4% of segment sales. The improvement was driven by strong price realization and higher volume, partially offset by strategic investments in our aerospace manufacturing capabilities, as well as inflation. For the full year, the aerospace segment delivered record annual sales and earnings. Segment sales were $2.3 billion, up 14%. Commercial services sales increased 29%, reflecting both favorable pricing and higher volume, supported by sustained high utilization of legacy aircraft and improved throughput by the MRO shops. LEAP and GTF activity also continues to increase, further contributing to commercial services growth.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:16:48
I do want to note that toward the end of the fiscal year, while underlying commercial services demand remained strong, we believe a portion of the growth was influenced by certain customers making advanced purchases to take advantage of a window of trade stability. Defense OEM sales increased 38%, primarily driven by strong demand for smart defense. In addition, new JDAM pricing took effect during the fourth quarter, which contributed to the strong year-end performance. Aerospace segment sales growth was partially offset by a 6% decrease in commercial OEM sales. The decrease was largely due to the Boeing work stoppage earlier in the year and our discipline and measured production ramp that followed, along with inventory normalization by airframers that occurred in the second half of the year. Moving into 2026, we expect these headwinds to ease as airframe production rates increase. Defense services sales were down 2%.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:17:56
As a reminder, while the timing of this business can be lumpy, demand signals remain healthy. Aerospace earnings for 2025 were $507 million, or 21.9% of segment sales, compared to $385 million, or 19% of segment sales. The 209 basis point improvement reflects solid price realization and higher sales volumes, partially offset by strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities, unfavorable mix, and inflation. We're making these strategic investments to enable future growth by expanding manufacturing engineers to support our ongoing efforts to increase automation. In addition, we have been increasing and developing our production frontline and team leaders to improve supervision, training, and problem-solving to drive productivity, improve cycle times, and increase output. Turning to industrial. As a reminder, my comments reflect the reclassification of certain sales between the end markets that Dan mentioned earlier. Industrial segment sales for the fourth quarter were $334 million, up 11% from $302 million.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:19:23
Our core industrial sales, which exclude the impact of China on-highway, grew 15% in the quarter. Transportation sales increased 15%, and oil and gas sales grew 13%, while power generation grew only 6% due to the impact of the divestiture of our combustion business in the second quarter of this year, which had averaged approximately $15 million of quarterly sales. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, power generation sales grew in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. Industrial segment earnings for the fourth quarter were $49 million, or 14.6% of segment sales, compared to $38 million, or 12.6% of segment sales. Within our core industrial business, margins expanded 330 basis points to 15.2% of core industrial sales, driven by price realization, partially offset by expected inflation and planned strategic investments in manufacturing capabilities. For 2025, industrial segment sales were $1.25 billion, compared to $1.3 billion, a decrease of 3%.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:20:51
Excluding the impact of China on-highway sales, core industrial sales increased 10% to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year. Marine transportation grew 9%, driven by both price and volume, as elevated ship build rates support strong OEM engine demand and lay the groundwork for future services opportunities. Oil and gas sales grew by 14%, as volume growth was driven by greater midstream and downstream gas investment. Power generation, excluding the impact from the divestiture of our combustion business, grew 22%, driven by our operational improvements that increased output to meet growing demand in various gas turbine systems' value streams. Industrial segment earnings for 2025 were $183 million, or 14.6% of segment sales, compared to $230 million, or 17.7% of segment sales.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:22:05
This decrease was largely a result of lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, both related to reduced China on-highway demand, partially offset by price realization. Core industrial margins for 2025 were 15.2% of segment sales, an increase of 110 basis points. This expansion reflects strong operational execution, price realization across the portfolio, and our ability to drive incremental margins from higher volumes, partly offset by expected inflation and planned manufacturing investments to further improve productivity. Non-segment expenses were $41 million for the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to $31 million. Adjusted non-segment expenses were $35 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $27 million. Non-segment expenses were $126 million in 2025, compared to $120 million. Adjusted non-segment expenses were $133 million in 2025, compared to $112 million. At the consolidated Woodward level, net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2025 was $471 million, compared to $439 million.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:23:37
Capital expenditures were $131 million for fiscal 2025, compared to $96 million. The increase in capital expenditures was driven by ongoing investment in automation and production to improve operations and prepare for growth. In addition, in 2025, we purchased the land for our new facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and this project is rapidly moving forward. Free cash flow was $340 million for fiscal 2025, compared to $343 million. The decline in free cash flow was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, partially offset by higher earnings. As of September 30, 2025, debt leverage was one times EBITDA. During fiscal 2025, as anticipated, we returned over $238 million to stockholders, including $173 million in share repurchases and $65 million in dividends.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:24:48
In November 2025, we successfully completed our previous three-year $600 million share repurchase authorization, more than one year ahead of schedule, reflecting our ongoing commitment to return cash to shareholders. We recently announced a new three-year share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.8 billion of common stock. This significant expansion reflects the board's confidence in Woodward's strategy, long-term growth outlook, and ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. In fiscal year 2026, our guidance assumes returning between $650-$700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach that fully leverages our strong balance sheet to drive growth. We are investing organically to advance automation and complete our new Spartanburg, South Carolina facility, while also actively evaluating selective, return-driven M&A opportunities.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:26:06
Our strong balance sheet positions us to act decisively when the right opportunities arise. Now, turning to our 2026 guidance. As we look ahead, we remain focused on our value drivers: growth, operational excellence, and innovation. Our fiscal 2026 guidance assumes a sustained strong demand environment, supporting continued sales growth and further margin expansion. At the consolidated level, Woodward net sales growth is expected to be between 7% and 12%. Aerospace sales growth is expected to be between 9% and 15%, and industrial sales are expected to grow 5% to 9%. In aerospace, we expect sales growth across the segment, weighted towards OEM, driven by a return to growth in commercial OEM and continued strength in defense OEM. Commercial services growth is expected to moderate as 2025 included high levels of spare LRU purchases, as well as the advanced purchases I mentioned earlier.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:27:22
Defense services are expected to show modest growth. Industrial sales are anticipated to grow across all of our primary markets. Note: we expect power generation growth to be muted in the first half due to the divestiture of our combustion product line. We anticipate China on-highway sales in 2026 to be approximately $60 million in line with 2025. Woodward adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $7.50 and $8.00, based on approximately 61 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, and an expected effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Aerospace segment earnings are expected to be 22%-23% of segment sales, and industrial segment earnings are expected to be 14.5%-15.5% of segment sales. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be between $300 million and $350 million.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:28:31
Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $290 million, which includes continued investment in automation and approximately $130 million dedicated to the build-out of our new production facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The increased spend also includes investment in MRO readiness and the start of a multi-year ERP upgrade project. Some additional items to help you with your modeling. We expect year-over-year price realization of approximately 5%. Non-segment expenses should be approximately 3.5% of sales. Consistent with historical trends, we anticipate performance to strengthen across the quarters of fiscal year 2026. Our fiscal 2026 guidance positions us to meet or exceed the long-term sales and earnings commitments for 2024 through 2026, which were established at our last investor day. Free cash flow is expected to be below our three-year target, reflecting higher strategic investments to support sustained long-term growth, including our new Spartanburg facility.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:29:54
We plan to introduce our next three-year outlook at our investor day in December of 2026. This concludes our comments on the business and results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025. Operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions.

Our first question comes from the line of Scott Mikus with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Scott Mikus
Director
0:30:56
Good morning, Chip and Bill. Very nice results.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:31:00
Howdy, Scott.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:31:00
Thank you.
Scott Mikus
Director
0:31:02
Chip, I had a question kind of on the aftermarket dynamics, particularly in engines. The LEAP MRO network is much more internal relative to the CFM56 network. So when you ship a fuel metering unit or any component on the LEAP engine, just how are you sure whether it's going to the aftermarket or OE channel? Are you being paid a different price versus both? Just given that GE and CFM more broadly is trying to route as many component sales through the LEAP MRO Premier network.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:31:38
Thanks for the question, Scott. We're sure about the PO status that comes to us, whether it's an install or a spare end item in terms of what customer is ordering it. We have a clear line of sight to what type of unit that is.
Scott Mikus
Director
0:31:57
Okay. Given the investments that you're making in automation, when I was at the Rock Cut campus, it was very impressive there. Is there anything structurally that you see that would potentially prevent your LEAP or GTF aftermarket margins to where they couldn't potentially reach CFM56 or V2500 margin levels?
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:32:22
Scott, there's nothing structurally in the way of that. It's kind of up to us to understand what the customers are seeing in the field with the units and developing the right repairs and overall procedures. We've learned a lot with the first units that have come back, whether it be the pump or SCU or FMU on LEAP, or it's the GTF fuel nozzles or actuation. We're pretty confident that we have the right design for repairability and service solutions for our customers that will achieve the right profitability.
Scott Mikus
Director
0:32:59
All right. I'll stop there. Thanks for the questions.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:33:02
Thanks, Scott.
Operator
0:33:05
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Douchelle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Scott Deuschle
Director
0:33:12
Hi, good evening. Bill, what growth are you assuming for legacy narrowbody engine aftermarket in 2026?
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:33:21
Scott, you said legacy narrowbody for?
Scott Deuschle
Director
0:33:26
Yeah, legacy narrowbody engines.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:33:29
Yes. Yeah. Obviously, we saw really good growth in 2025. Based off of that, we would expect sort of single-digit growth rates coming through in 2026 on the legacy narrowbody. We expect to see some price, obviously, come through. Volume at these levels will be tough, but the MRO shop surprised us last year, so we will see if they get some more productivity. I would say single digit.
Scott Deuschle
Director
0:34:07
Okay. And then, Bill, does the EPS guide include any benefit of the recent share repurchase authorization increase, or do you not really assume that authorization or repurchases, excuse me, in the guide? Thank you.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:34:19
Yes, we do expect and put that into the guide.
Scott Deuschle
Director
0:34:26
Okay. Last question, Chip, can you give us any sense as to how much your current power generation revenue is tied to Caterpillar? I'd be curious if you could talk a little bit about the growth outlook you expect from that customer in the years ahead.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:34:42
We have been receiving pretty healthy growth from all of our power gen customers. Bill and Dan talked about a little bit of reclass that went on. It was really by examining where all of our customers and products were being used. Some traditional oil and gas customers have been involved in more power gen type applications, maybe not utility grade, but behind-the-meter type applications. Folks like Caterpillar and INNIO and Baker Hughes are all kind of playing in that segment of the market. It is a very interesting aspect of the power gen growth opportunity that we are capitalizing on. As far as carving out just a single customer like Caterpillar, we do not do that. I think you can be satisfied that as they grow, we grow.

We're on some of their gas engines with SOGAV and valves and actuation, and we're on some of their liquid fuel engines with actuation and governor products. We've got a good staple of products distributed on their products, and it varies by application.

Chip Blankenship

Thank you.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:36:20
Kind of extend the question here on the commercial aftermarket because I think you said muted next year, but you gave it the prepared marks are pretty helpful. I think you said LEAP GTF by the end of calendar year 2026, the same size or larger than legacy. When I take that in connection with the single-digit comment you just gave to Scott, I mean, I guess it implies that maybe the pull forward that you saw in this quarter and prior quarters is significantly larger than maybe I expected.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:36:50
Maybe if you can just kind of walk through those puts and takes to round out that comment, what are you thinking about LEAP GTF growth next year in light of what the OEMs are saying and the magnitude of the pull forward that you saw this year and whether you're sure that's not repeating or whether there's potential that was actually restocking? Thanks.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:37:11
Yeah. Thanks for the question. We really do believe there'll be strong repair growth for LEAP and GTF. We believe, like Bill was saying, there'll be either flat to a little bit of repair growth on V2500 and CFM56. The big variable is this lumpy order behavior that we saw last quarter on spare end items. There's a pretty substantial demand there. Those are quite high-priced individual items to be ordered compared to a repair. When you think about the total top line, it has an outsized effect on that top line as well as the earnings. We don't forecast that happening again. There could be additional activity. We don't rule that out, and we're prepared to capture that if it shows up.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:38:09
I don't think it's prudent to forecast that or put that in our plan because we don't have any line of sight to that at this time.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:38:18
If I could just follow up on the price comment, Bill, you said 5% next year. I assume that's more weighted to aerospace and increasingly weighted to aftermarket. Maybe any additional color by segment and by subsegment within that. Thanks.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:38:32
Yeah. Correct. At the total Woodward level of 5%, in the comments we talked about the JDAM price increase in the fourth quarter of 2025, we'll see that flow through the first three quarters of 2026. With that and some catalog growth, Arrow will outpace industrial slightly, but we still also will see good price results from our industrial team as well. Thanks a lot for your question.
Operator

Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Noah Poponak
Managing Director
0:39:21
Hey, guys. Thanks for the question.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:39:24
Hey, Noah.
Noah Poponak
Managing Director
0:39:26
Can you quantify in absolute dollars whatever you're deeming to have been lumpy or pulled forward in the aerospace aftermarket in 2025 revenue?
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:39:44
Yeah. No, as you can imagine, it's hard to quantify because the customer isn't telling us exactly kind of their thought. Here, I'll give you a few numbers that will be in the footnotes of the 10K. Back where we lay out by segment, sales by region. You'll see that from 2024 to 2025, sales grew $50 million. Some part of that $50 million is normal growth, and then some part of that is a part of this advanced purchases. It's just hard to quantify exactly.
Noah Poponak
Managing Director
0:40:31
Okay. That's helpful. Can you quantify where LEAP and GTF aftermarket came in for the year 2025 versus 2024?
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:40:49
The LEAP and GTF are gaining on the legacy, let's put it that way. Like I said before, they're kind of in the same zip code, but not equal. We're just talking repair activity, not including spare end items. We really do think that that's going to cross over in the late 2026, early 2027 time period. That may sound like an earlier crossover compared to what we said at Investor Day back in 2023. That original graph in 2023, in the legacy items, included some wide body and regional component repair. It also, in the new, included GEnx. We're trying to strip out some of that other information and make it cleaner for you. Like last quarter, I committed that we would clarify that.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:41:45
When we do run our model out and look at kind of how fourth quarter ended, how inputs are coming in for both the legacy as well as the LEAP GTF, that's how we come up with that sort of crossover period, which I hope clarifies things for you.
Noah Poponak
Managing Director
0:42:02
Okay. Great. That's super helpful. Then just on the aerospace segment margin, the guidance requires a pretty significant slowdown in the incrementals. I guess in the fourth quarter, you're saying the incremental benefits from the items we just discussed, and therefore it's sort of a leveling out over the two years, or is there more to it?
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:42:29
Yeah. No, I think your question is about the incremental coming down from about $42.5 for Aero and coming down in 2026. It is a few things. It is our OEM mix growing on the Aero side, which is a mix down. Yes, that is the main driver, just the amount of OEM that we expect to come through in 2026. Just a reminder about that, it is a good thing. We are creating the installed base to get the services revenue and earnings on later.
Noah Poponak

Thank you. Good afternoon.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:43:26
Good afternoon.
Christopher Glynn
Managing Director
0:43:27
Yeah, curious on the defense side, a specific and a general question. Where are you with guided weapons clarity, longer term, how those programs and lot orders are flowing through? Should we anticipate that growth is kind of leveling off on a sequential basis, or is the volume still ramping? I know you have a big price aspect to growth in that category.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:44:02
Our guided weapons programs, plural, JDAM, small diameter bomb, SDB, and the AIM-9X are all kind of having a little bit different behavior. JDAM is up substantially, but we feel like that will remain level for a good while. We do not have any orders for the other two, but we have indications that customers are asking us to do capacity studies and work with our supply chain on capacity studies. Some of these things are leading indicators that these other product lines might experience some growth opportunities. We do not have anything specific, Chris, on that right now.
Christopher Glynn
Managing Director
0:44:50
Okay. Great. Thanks. You mentioned global capacity investment for the industrial aftermarket. I'm guessing that's oriented towards the marine side, but just wondering if we could drill into that investment element there.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:45:06
Yeah. We have been doing a little bit of flag planting here and there on MRO shops. When you think about a power plant and all of the scope of supply that we could provide to aeroderivative or heavy-duty frame power plant installations, just like an aircraft engine, they undergo maintenance cycles. We are finding that we have the ability to grow our service content with these customers when we are a little closer to their region. We have done some of that in the prior couple of years, and we anticipate doing a little bit more of it just to try and get closer to the customers and grow the opportunity to service our fuel metering valves and other types of scope of supply like that that are on our customers' gas turbines, as well as reaching out with the opportunity to do some repair in reciprocating engines.

Good evening. Hey, Gavin.
Gavin Parsons

Guys, what are you assuming for OE de-stocking? It would be helpful if you could parse that out kind of by airframe and engine.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:46:30
Thanks for the question, Gavin. It's a little difficult to parse that out for you, that detail of a way from a customer standpoint. But we feel like, broadly speaking, somewhere in our second quarter sort of time period, if airframe customers and engine customers hit the rates and pull like they've forecast for us, we could be de-stocked by sometime in that second quarter towards the end of our first half fiscal year.
Gavin Parsons
Director
0:47:06
Okay. That's helpful. Then on CapEx going forward, should we kind of assume that normalizes once you finish kind of the A350 build-out or by the end of the decade, or are we starting to look at build-out for maybe a new single aisle?
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:47:20
Yeah. For right now, Gavin, we'll say that the Spartanburg investment is causing that peak. We're going to continue to kind of look through 2027, 2028, 2029, and we'll give you a clear view in December of what's out there. We're understanding our next single aisle investments. Right now, the Spartanburg is sort of what we see there on the near horizon.

Bill Lacey
CFO
0:48:11
Thanks.
Michael Ciarmoli
Managing Director
0:48:11
Just to stay on—how are you? Just to stay on Gavin's question there. The CapEx for Spartanburg, can you support, or will that have enough capacity to support programs beyond the A350? I mean, is there kind of—does this build-out contemplate next-gen single aisle?
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:48:33
Yeah. Thanks for the question. The investment in Spartanburg, that facility has additional capacity over and above the A350 for us to put select product lines in there that make sense and are synergistic. We're betting on a successful campaign for next single aisle scope. That facility would not, by itself, be able to support NSA volumes. We have bought enough land there to build a sister facility for NSA support. We are thinking ahead where it makes sense on small amounts of investment dollars, but we're not putting any big investment dollars on NSA capacity.
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:49:21
We'll have to really take a look at what that horizon and life cycle looks like from the design phase through the build and flight test phase and lay that out in comparison to our facilities and what's going on with legacy programs before we decide kind of how much additional capacity we'd need. That's a thought exercise. Even like Bill was saying, we'll share more at Investor Day in December, but some of that NSA thought exercise will mature as we understand from the Airbuses and Boeings of this world about what that timeframe looks like.
Michael Ciarmoli
Managing Director
0:49:59
Okay. Sure. And then just back to Noah's question, actually. You were talking about incrementals, but I guess just absolute margins, looking at the low end of the range, really no margin expansion. You're obviously hitting and exceeding the targets, and you talked about the OEM mix, which makes sense. As you're seeing this ramp on LEAP and GTF, is there margin dilution there on services? I mean, do you have to get over some learning curves? I mean, I'm assuming straight spare sales would be highly accretive on those platforms. Is there anything else dilutive with the LEAP and the GTF ramp up there?
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:50:39
Yeah. I'll jump on that, and Chip maybe cover me if I miss a part. No, no, the LEAP GTF service margins are good. It really is the impact of the overall OE and how that impacts things. Obviously, on the low end of the range, it contemplates some other headwinds. To the point about LEAP GTF, margins are good. Again, OE mix is the primary driver of the rate expansion that you're seeing in our guide. Yeah. I would just follow up and say that we intend to expand margins, and that's what you see, a guide there that allows for some headwinds to get in the way of that intent. We've got plans in place and programs and the automation benefit that we're planning some realization of for 2026. We intend to get productivity.
Michael Ciarmoli

Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:51:58
Afternoon, Gautam.
Bill Lacey
CFO
0:51:59
Hey, Gautam.
Gautam Khanna
Analyst
0:52:01
Just to elaborate on the first question, which we'd written about before, which is this LTSA versus Spot aftermarket dynamic on LEAP versus CFM. Do you guys—I’m just curious—on CFM56, when you sell into a spare part into the GE network, I presume that's a lower price than what you would sell into if it's an MRO or airline outside the network. Does that same logic apply for LEAP when you're selling a spare part to a direct user like an airline versus when you sell it through the GE internal MRO network? If that's true, why wouldn't there be structural differences in profitability between those two platforms in the aftermarket over time?
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:52:55
The reason why there's no structural difference is because there's really no structural difference to the contracting, Gautam. When we sell spare end items, it can be to an airline. It can be to an MRO shop that has a variety of people under different agreements. We have some asset management contracts with some of the bigger MROs, just like a CFM or GE or Safran network. The whole landscape is similar between the previous generation and this generation. When you think about repair, it's also the same thing. Whether it's a spare end item, spare parts, or a repair, we have fairly similar contracting principles in the LEAP ecosystem that we do to the CFM56. I think there's nothing really there to explore further except that we have a lot more LRUs to take care of.
Gautam Khanna
Analyst
0:54:09
Gotcha. Thank you. A follow-up on the mixed dynamic within the aftermarket. I know you talked about repairs, and I think that is distinct from spares. I just wanted to get a sense. Is the overall aftermarket profitability next year a little bit softer than it was in 2025, just based on kind of more repair, less spares, or was there any nuance there that you were trying to convey?
Chip Blankenship
Chairman and CEO
0:54:41
Really, no nuance to convey there. We have a good blended service earnings profile for 2026. We're pretty happy with that. We'll see if the spare end item, if more comes through than we forecast, like it did last year. I mean, it's really hard to tell. We'll have some upside if that happens.

Finally, I will give you an update on the development of our business and our guidance.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:01:33
Let me start by giving you an update on the key business developments of the second quarter. On slide 2, the important messages for Q3 2025. Our free cash flow in the quarter was €39 million, totaling €110 million in the first nine months of 2025, while inventories are down to €316 million, coming from €369 million at the year end 2024. This shows we are well on track with our strategy to rebuild our cash position after we had depleted that with the construction of our 300 millimeter clean room, the Innovation Center in the years 2023 and 2024. In Q3 we recognized new orders of €124 million, which lead to an equipment order backlog of €287 million where we have achieved a book-to-bill of 1.04. We concluded the quarter with revenues of €120 million. With that we were in our guided range of €110 million to €140 million.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:02:37
The gross margin reached 39% in Q3 and averaged 37% in the first nine months. This figure includes a one-off expense related to our implemented personnel reduction earlier in the year. Adjusted for this effect, the gross margin after nine months came out at 38%, slightly below previous year's 39%, mainly due to volume shifts and FX headwinds as the market remained soft. We had to adjust our fiscal 2025 guidance two weeks ago. We are now expecting revenues in the range between €530 million and €565 million, which corresponds to the lower half of the initial guidance €530 million to €600 million, and a gross margin of now 40% to 41%, down from previously 41% to 42%, and an EBIT margin of now around 17% to 19% from previously 18% to 22%. AI continues to be the main end market driver, especially for our optoelectronics segments.

Automotive-driven power electronics demand, on the other hand, remains soft. Christian will now provide a detailed look into our financials on the following pages before I take over with an update. Christian,
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:03:58
thanks Felix, and hello to everyone. Let me start with the key points of our revenue development on slide 3. In a soft market environment, we achieved revenues of €120 million, down versus the €156 million last year, but well in the guided range of €110 million to €140 million. For the first nine months, revenues came in at €370 million, down about 9% year over year. A breakdown per application shows that 66% of equipment revenues after nine months come from GaN and SiC Power, 14% from LED, 16% from optoelectronics, and a 5% contribution from R&D tools. The after-sales business contributed to total revenues with €80 million.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:04:52
The after-sales share of revenues after nine months was up by 2 percentage points year over year to about 22%. Now let's take a closer look at the financial KPIs of the income statement on slide 4. I already talked about the revenue line. Gross profit decreased year over year in Q3 2025 to €46 million. Gross profit in the quarter was negatively affected by approximately €8 million due to volume shifts from Q3 into Q4 and around €2 million due to FX effects. Subsequently, the gross margin in the current quarter came in at 39%, down 4 percentage points versus the prior year. After nine months, gross profit was at €136 million, 15% below last year's figure at 37%. Our gross margin after nine months was 2 percentage points lower than after the same period last year.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:05:55
Please recall as stated in our Q1 release, this includes a one-off expense of a mid-single-digit million euro amount in connection with the implemented personnel reduction in the operations area. Adjusted for these effects, the gross margin after nine months would be at around 38% for the remainder of the year. We calculate with an average U.S. dollar euro exchange rate of 1.15 and the continued weakness of the Japanese euro rate due to high expected revenues in foreign currency. In Q4 we expect an additional around €3 million negative impact in revenues and gross margin, with the larger part resulting from the U.S. dollar and the smaller part from the Japanese yen. Together with the above-mentioned €2 million effect realized in Q3, this totals to approximately €5 million negative FX impacts, which corresponds with the 1 percentage point gross margin adjustment of our guidance.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:07:02
OpEx in the quarter was slightly up by 4% year over year to €31 million, primarily driven by higher R&D spending compared to the previous year. For the first nine months, OpEx came in at €94 million, a reduction of minus 6% driven primarily by around 13% lower R&D expenses. R&D expenses were down mainly due to reduced external contract work and consumables costs. As stated before, visible in Q3 numbers, R&D cost in H2 will be higher than the H1 number. For the full year, we expect R&D costs to be slightly lower than in 2024. EBIT for the quarter is €15 million, a significant drop versus Q3 2024. The main drivers, besides the already mentioned negative factors impacting gross profit, is a negative operating leverage effect resulting from lower revenues.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:08:08
The weaker performance in Q3 led to an EBIT of €42 million for the first nine months, a decrease of 30% year over year. This translates into an EBIT margin of 11%. Again, please recall the one-off expense in connection with the personnel reduction mentioned before. Adjusted for this effect, the nine-month EBIT margin would be at around 20%. Now to our key balance sheet indicators on slide 5. On a more positive note, working capital has continued to come down by around €100 million since end of fiscal year 2024. Several balance sheet items contributed here. We continued to decrease inventories to €316 million compared to €369 million at the end of 2024. Year over year, inventories have been reduced by €111 million.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:09:10
As we continue to work through the surplus accumulated last year and as stated before, we expect further inventory reductions to materialize throughout 2025 and into 2026. Trade receivables at the end of September were at €129 million compared to €193 million at the end of 2024. The reduction versus year end is mainly the result of the collection of the payments related to the large shipments. End of 2024 advance payments received from customers at quarter end were at €73 million, a nice recovery of about €20 million versus end of last quarter, but still down about €9 million from end of 2024. This is primarily driven by some cutoff date effects and some regional shifts in the order book. Advance payments now represent about 25% of order backlog.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:10:13
The fourth key element of working capital, trade payables, has now come down to €24 million from €34 million at the end of 2024. This reflects a now fully adjusted supply chain situation with significantly reduced purchasing levels. Adding it all up, our operating cash flow after nine months improved to €128 million, a strong improvement of €100 million versus last year's €28 million. On the back of the improvement in operating cash flow, free cash flow improved even more. It came in at €110 million after three quarters compared to negative €58 million last year. This was supported by a strong reduction in our CapEx with €18 million. After nine months, our CapEx was significantly lower than last year's number of €86 million. This is primarily due to the now completed investment in the Innovation Center.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:11:15
As of September 2025, our cash balance, including other current financial assets, improved to €153 million. This equals an increase of €88 million compared to €65 million at the end of fiscal year 2024, despite the dividend payment of about €17 million in Q2. As stated before, a key priority remains the rebuilding of a strong cash position. Our financial decisions continue to be guided by this objective to ensure a robust liquidity foundation for the future. This has served us well in the past and we see ourselves well on track towards this target. With that, let me hand you back over to Felix.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:11:59
Thank you, Christian. Let me continue with an update on key trends in our different markets, starting with optoelectronics and lasers. In optoelectronics, AIXTRON has seen a continued recovery in demand for datacom applications which began earlier this year and has been reaffirmed in Q3.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:12:18
This trend is expected to continue into 2026 and beyond. Our customers are increasingly transitioning to 150 millimeter indium phosphide substrates and photonic integrated circuit devices requiring advanced epitaxial performance. The segment is technology-wise very demanding. It requires excellence in uniformity, doping control, and defect management, areas where our G10-AsP platform excels. Historically, AIXTRON has held a market share of over 90% in this domain served by our G3 and G4 planetary reactors. The G10-AsP is now establishing itself as the tool of record in the laser market, replacing legacy systems at leading customers. Q3 shipments and scheduled Q4 deliveries underscore our strong market position with repeat orders from key customers such as Nokia. Additionally, VCSEL demand is recovering, driven by LIDAR modules and automotive applications.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:13:25
We therefore expect that tools for the various laser applications will contribute significantly to our full year order intake and also into next year, 2026. Now let me move on to our LED business. We are seeing first encouraging signs of reinvestment in red, orange, yellow (ROY) LED applications. Utilization rates for red, orange, yellow LEDs have been high throughout the year with double-digit system shipments for mini LED applications driven by demand for RGB fine pitch displays. Notably, some TV manufacturers such as Samsung are shifting to full RGB backlighting, boosting micro LED demand. While overall micro LED demand remains moderate, medium-term drivers are positive. We've received multiple orders for our G10-AsP platform, primarily for red pixel production in next generation AR devices. The recent announcement of Meta's AR glasses based on micro LED technology signals a broader trend with more OEM products expected in 2027 and 2028.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:14:34
Our G5 Plus and G10-AsP platforms are ideally suited for these applications which require ultra-small pixels and defect-free epitaxial dies. The launch of Garmin's first micro LED watch is likely to further stimulate demand across blue, green, and red micro LED segments. In solar, after years of moderate investment, we are now seeing renewed interest, including multiple orders for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite applications in constellation projects. LEO satellites are those that orbit the Earth at altitudes of about 2,000 km. They enable both fast communication as well as high-resolution earth observation by operating in a zone just above the Earth's atmosphere, where they can maintain strong signal connections with ground stations. These satellites work in interconnected constellations of hundreds or thousands of satellites to provide global coverage. Examples are Starlink or OneWeb. We anticipate this trend to continue in the years 2026, 2027, and 2028.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:15:48
Let me now come to gallium nitride power. AIXTRON SE continues to lead the GaN power segment with over 85% market share across all wafer sizes and power ranges. Although demand is softer compared to last year, we are seeing solid volume orders for both 150 and 200 millimeter solutions, particularly from Asian customers, with ramp-up plans extending into 2026 and 2027. We've also strengthened our partnership with IMEC. Together, we are accelerating innovation at both the architectural and device levels. IMEC has been using both our G5 Plus as well as the G10-GaN platform for its 150 and 200 millimeter partner programs for quite a while, and we have now shipped a 300 millimeter gallium nitride platform to enable broader access to IMEC's recipes. We see first power semiconductor manufacturers adopting 300 millimeter GaN technology, such as Infineon Technologies.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:16:51
Regarding the overall GaN market, we are still dealing with a moderately oversaturated install base requiring some more time to absorb existing capacities. This digestion phase is expected to continue for some quarters before a broader recovery sets in. With that, let me come to silicon carbide. While end-user demand remains soft, we observe moderately increased utilization rates at some of our customers. On the one hand, this is due to new EV models being launched, which drive demand. On the other hand, SiC is starting to enter the AI data center value chain, especially in voltage classes of 1200 volts and above. You have seen the new Nvidia power architecture, which relies exclusively on wide bandgap power devices at the International Conference for Silicon Carbide and Related Materials, in short, ICSCRM, in Busan, Korea. Early in Q3, various industry players confirmed mid-term adoption of super junction silicon carbide technology.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:18:06
This technology basically means that instead of one thick silicon carbide EPI layer deposited today, we will see in the future multiple thinner silicon carbide EPI deposition steps. These thinner epitaxial layers require enhanced uniformity and shortened process time. Our G10-SiC platform is well positioned to meet these needs, offering superior productivity due to the benefit of the batch concept, especially for thinner layers. We are proud to have shipped our 100th G10.6 CBD system, marking a major milestone and reinforcing our leadership in the silicon carbide power segment in this quarter. The silicon carbide market is still undergoing a longer digestion period, particularly in western-oriented regions. As a result, there are no major decisions for new fab investments on the agenda these days. In summary, we can say that the soft market period still continues in almost all markets apart from the laser market.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:19:18
Driven by the hunger for data from AI applications, a demand pickup will not materialize in 2025 and visibility in 2026 is still limited. With that, let me now move to our guidance. Due to the market situation just described, we had to adjust our guidance for 2025 two weeks ago. Based on the current soft market environment and assuming an exchange rate of $1.15 per euro for the remainder of the year, we now expect the following outlook for 2025. We expect to generate revenues in the range between €530 million and €565 million, which corresponds to the lower half of the initial guidance, which was initially €530 million to €600 million. FX effects led to an approximately 1 percentage point reduction of gross margin and EBIT margin.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:20:19
As a result, we expect now a gross margin of around 40% to 41% and an EBIT margin of around 17% to 19%. The guidance for the gross margin and EBIT margin includes a one-off expense of a mid-single-digit million euro amount in relation to the implemented personnel reduction in the operations area earlier this year. The measure will lead to annualized savings in the mid-single-digit million euro range in the future, which corresponds to an improvement in the gross margin and EBIT margin of around 1 percentage point. As previously stated, we expect our tools to remain exempt from U.S. tariffs. However, we continue to closely monitor the impact of U.S. trade policies on the global economy and stand ready to implement any necessary measures to ensure the best possible outcomes for our customers and stakeholders.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:21:20
Let me at this place also give you a first outlook for the next year, 2026. We clearly see that the medium and long term drivers for AIXTRON's growth such as demand for GaN and SiC power devices, LED and micro LED applications, lasers and LEO solar applications remain intact. However, visibility for the fiscal year 2026 remains low and as of today we do not see signs of a demand recovery yet. Therefore, our view today is that 2026 revenues are likely to be slightly below those of 2025, maybe flat. Furthermore, assuming an exchange rate of $1.15 per euro, we expect the EBIT margin not to come out below the range of the current year, maybe better. As always, we will give you firm guidance with the release of our financial year results end of February 26th.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:22:27
With that, I'll pass it back to Christian before we take questions.
Christian Ludwig
VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications
0:22:31
Thank you very much Felix. Thank you very much Christian. Operator, we will now take the questions.
Operator
0:22:36
Yes, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q and A session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 9 and star on your telephone keypad. Please note questions can only be asked via telephone. If you wish to make use of this option, please ensure you dial in by phone. In this case, we recommend muting the webcast. Please press 9 star now to state your question. The first question comes from Jana d'Armenon from Jefferies, over to you.
Janardan Menon
Managing Director
0:23:25
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch upon your final comments on 2026.
Janardan Menon
Managing Director
0:23:37
To start off with, you said that 2026 is likely flat or down, but it sounded like you expect Opto to be up and your trend when I look at your Q3, GaN seems to be doing quite well while SiC is down quite sharply. Would it be fair to say that at current visibility you would expect Opto to be up, SiC to be down and GaN to be somewhat flattish? Is that a view? That would be sort of a preliminary view for next year.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:24:13
I think you get a perfect read on this one. Let me try even to quantify it for you. I think roughly in terms of percentage of revenues we expect as to percentage of total revenues next year we are expecting to gain about 10% points for Opto, 10% points gain for GaN and minus 20% points in silicon carbide.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:24:40
Yeah, so a pretty weak year for SiC but very strong year for the Opto segment, used to be a smaller segment, so adding 10% point of the total is quite a significant one. This also helps on the margin. You have seen my comment related to margin quality and GaN also as a % gaining a bit.
Janardan Menon
Managing Director
0:25:00
Understood, thank you. Just to follow up on the SiC side, I understand that demand is quite weak right now. There's quite a bit of supply out there and automotive is still sluggish. Listening to companies like STMicro and all who are under quite severe margin pressure on the silicon carbide side, they seem to be accelerating their 6 inch to 8 inch transition because they see that as a way to improve their profitability, and ST specifically said they'll do it through the course of 2026 and by early 2027.
Janardan Menon
Managing Director
0:25:42
I would assume that would be true for other parts of the installed base as well? Given the price pressure on silicon carbide, do you not see this as a driver at all for your silicon carbide revenue and do you really need the end demand to recover before any improvement happens?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:25:58
I think you catch it very well. Yes, the 6 to 8 inch transition is going very fast, especially outside of China players. I think worldwide outside of China we see the 6 to 8 inch transition progressing at rapid speed as you have indicated with one company name, and we see the same in other players. In fact, we do hear from some of our customers that while end customer revenue is flat or down, the unit numbers are going up.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:26:28
Unit numbers is of course what we as an equipment maker like, because in the end it's about wafers and increasing numbers of wafers. In fact, we expect that by the end of 2026, the transition in the Western world, as I may call it now, including Japan, is probably concluded. In 2027, 2028, I would expect the volume to be completely going on 8 inch. We do see on 8 inch also much better quality wafers, which helps the customers in terms of yield. That's one of the cost reduction drivers. Also, 8 inch substrates are getting good pricing now. Initially, they used to be very expensive. Now the pricing for 8 inch substrate is going well and that at some point needs. The excessive overcapacity that I was speaking about at some point will be digested.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:27:17
I would not dare at this point to give an exact prediction because there's multiple variables that we are just discussing. I think we can clearly see at some point the overcapacity will be digested and that there will be new demand.
Janardan Menon
Managing Director
0:27:29
That transition doesn't mean buying new 8 inch machines from you, is it to generate revenue for you.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:27:37
At some point it will mean buying new demand and new tools when the existing overcapacity is consumed. Right now we talk about existing overcapacity which is just being converted.
Janardan Menon
Managing Director
0:27:48
Got it? Understood. Thanks.
Operator
0:27:51
Next up is Martin Marandon from ODDO BHF.
Martin Marandon-Carlhian
Equity Research Analyst
0:28:00
Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first one is on something that you put on the press release on gallium nitride. You talked about utilization rate rising in data center and I was wondering what does it mean exactly?
Martin Marandon-Carlhian
Equity Research Analyst
0:28:19
I mean, does it mean that you already anticipate orders in the near term linked to the new 800 volt architecture from Nvidia? Does that mean something else?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:28:31
Let me explain what we mean by that. Thanks for the question. What we have seen is we have seen in the years, especially 2023 and 2024, we have seen quite a number of gallium nitride orders which were happening a bit ahead of the wave, such that I would say early 2025 at the existing volume customers, we have seen quite a significant overcapacity of installed base also in gallium nitride. That was the reason why in 2025 compared to 2024, our gallium nitride shipments have been slowed down quite a bit because our existing and established volume customers literally had also in GaN, not only in SiC but also in GaN, some overcapacity to be digested.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:29:25
As we started into 2025 and some of our customers also in gallium nitride, we've seen installed base utilization to be quite low. Now towards the end of 2025 and looking into 2026, we see that a much larger fraction of the installed capacity is being utilized at the existing GaN customers, while those who newly entered the GaN market in 2024 and 2025, in previous earnings calls you may have recorded that we said there are still new players entering the market to gallium nitride, and those new entrants at this point in time are still in the qualification or in the device and the sampling phase of their technologies to their end customers. You have seen the numbers that I was just commenting towards the question that was asking. We expect the GaN segment for us to be slightly up next year.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:30:25
Again, it's an indication, qualitative indication as we see that utilization is increasing and we expect due to the increasing utilization some expansion orders from some customers kicking in. The broad market recovery as I've indicated with a real volume pull, we don't expect in 2026, we rather expect that in 2027-2028, but some increasing orders in 2026. Does that answer the question?
Martin Marandon-Carlhian
Equity Research Analyst
0:30:55
Yes, that's very clear, but just a follow up on this. I mean, why would you anticipate more of that volume in 2027 and 2028? Because we read that this, a new architecture from Nvidia is supposed to be for Ruby Neutra, which is launched in H2 2027. You know, I was expecting capacity maybe to come a bit earlier than this.
Martin Marandon-Carlhian
Equity Research Analyst
0:31:23
Does this mean that maybe it will not be one of the % GaN for some steps at the beginning, you know, the 50 and 12 volt steps, and it will go gradually? Can you explain a bit why it should come more gradually? Let's say
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:31:43
this is based on our current view, what we have and the signals we get from our customers. I share the view that the new 800 volt architecture will lead to significant volumes around 2027, 2028. This is also our view. For us, it's always very difficult to predict the exact timing when customers will place the orders for new equipment because we do see certain trends, but we cannot look into the exact budgets and plans of our customers. Therefore, at this point in time, we can only comment on what we are currently seeing.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:32:18
If later on in the year volume kicks in and orders accelerate, we are very happy to see it. We don't see signs to that yet.
Martin Marandon-Carlhian
Equity Research Analyst
0:32:25
Great. Maybe a last question on GaN. YOEL is saying that the GaN market will be close to $500 million this year. Without data centers being really a contributor, what would you guess would be the size of the data center market for GaN compared to the overall size of the market this year, like $500 million?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:32:53
I do not have the exact timing for my message in mind. We have looked at a midterm perspective, I think somewhere triangulating 2028, 2029, 2030, something a little further out.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:33:08
In this triangulation that we've done, the data center opportunity with an upside of about 50% on top of the market, without the data center opportunity, you may recall that we have a slide out there in the investor deck which on the X axis has three time horizons. I think 2020 to 2023, I think 2024 to 2026, and whatever 2028 to 2030, something like this. On the Y axis, the different voltage levels, low voltage, medium voltage, and then very high voltage. There we have put the AI data center opportunity, and this is the market that I'm referring to.
Martin Marandon-Carlhian
Equity Research Analyst
0:33:44
Okay, that's clear. Maybe last question for me on the gross margin. I mean, the current guidance implies record gross margin in Q4. Can you help us maybe see the main drivers of this?
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:34:03
Yep. Hey Martin, Christian here. I take that one.
Christian Danninger
CFO
0:34:09
I mean like in the last years the Q4 will be the strongest quarter just by volume, purely shipments. Beyond that, we expect an improved product mix, especially a higher share of final acceptance revenues coming with high margins and also some fixed cost aggression effects. Little bit of color on the product mix, we expect a big share of T10 family products, around 50% of Q4 revenue, so that you get an idea. Also, looking at the comparing this with the last year margin, these margin ranges appear cheaper for us. Yeah,
Martin Marandon-Carlhian
Equity Research Analyst
0:34:54
agreed. Thank you very much.
Operator
0:34:57
Next up is Didier Semama from Bank of America, over to you.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:35:07
Yes, thank you for taking my question. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:35:14
Got a couple of questions of a clarification on the comments you made earlier on 2026, and perhaps my math is not right, so please don't shout at me if I'm wrong. I think you said the SiC part of the business would be down 20 percentage points in terms of group sales. I mean, by my calculation, that would imply pretty minor revenue contribution in 2026. Is that correct? Equally, optos, I think you said 10 percentage points within the group. That's going to put it at something like $150 million next year. Is that the right ballpark?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:35:52
I would say right ballpark, right indications, yes, as far as we can say. I mean, it's very early, but we really wanted to give you something. Yeah, exactly. Yes.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:36:02
Now that's incredibly helpful, to be perfectly honest.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:36:06
I guess the question, when I look at the comments you put on the nine month report, you said about 50% of the bookings came from power electronics. I have to assume that the rest mostly come from optos because LEDs, etc., is fairly de minimis, which, if you compare to what you said last year, means that the bookings in optos are probably up meaningfully, which is again consistent with what you said. Perhaps, you know, when you look at history, optos, like all the other segments, have tended to be incredibly cyclical. Would you think that there is duration in that growth in optoelectronics beyond 2026, or do you think that the big CapEx cycle we see currently for silicon photonics and lasers is going to be, as we've seen in the past, a big, big year and then it falls off a cliff?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:36:58
Oh, I think you ask the trillion, the multi-trillion dollar question, how long the AI bubble will last. I do not have the crystal ball for you. Right. If I would, I might not be sitting in this place right now.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:37:15
Okay. Honestly, I wish you good luck.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:37:18
I think it fully relates, given the serious note. Some joking aside, a big part of the laser part is in fact coming from the datacom. Right. The datacom again is driven by the AI and the AI data center build out. It really hinges on that one to a very big part, probably 50%, 60%. It really depends on how exactly that's progressing. We can only see what we have now in our visibility. A longer term view, two, three years out, I think it's as difficult as for everybody predicting the AI trend.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:37:57
No, for sure.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:37:59
If I may, as a follow up, you mentioned Nokia, slash, Infinera as a customer for your G10 platform for their peak products. Can you give us a few more examples of key customers for that division so that we understand the underlying dynamics? Please.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:38:14
Unfortunately, I cannot because we keep customer names always strictly, very strictly confidential as under NDA. We stick to that. We are extremely sensitive to that. I can give you a qualitative indication. Imagine you think who may be the top 10 providers for data communications devices for AI. You can assume that at least 80%, 90%, maybe 100% of those guys are our customers currently placing order with us. 90% of those are placing orders for the G10-AsP. Maybe I can give you that indication and I really mean it as I say it.
Didier Scemama
Managing Director and Senior Analyst
0:38:52
Yeah, no, no, that's very clear. Thank you so much.
Operator
0:39:01
Now we're coming to the next question. It comes from Madeleine Jenkins from UBS.
Madeleine Jenkins
Associate Director of Equity Research
0:39:06
Thanks for taking my question. I just had one. On utilization rates, you mentioned that the GaN power were increasing. Could you quantify that at all? Also, I guess get a sense of your silicon carbide utilization rates at kind of Chinese and then Western customers. Thank you.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:39:26
So I understand your question about detailed utilization rates. We don't have those and we could also not share them if we would have them. What we can say is that based on spare part orders, based on service orders, we see a trend here, which is a good utilization increase for the GaN power, which leads us to expect some volume expansion orders in 2026 at a moderate level, as we have indicated.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:40:04
At the same time in silicon carbide for the overall market, I think towards the beginning of the year, we have seen very low utilizations. With very low, I mean, really far below 50%, means far more than 50% of the capacity installed in the market was standing idle early in the market. Maybe we are now approaching a 50%, 60%, 70% utilization in silicon carbide. We do see it increasing, but we are still far from a level on the market where customers are really going into reorders and expansion orders. I think that's not yet on the agenda.
Madeleine Jenkins
Associate Director of Equity Research
0:40:42
Okay, that's helpful. I guess all your kind of new orders in silicon carbide specifically, are those kind of new customers in China? Is that the right way to look at it?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:40:51
Yes, we did have significant orders and shipments in 2025 in silicon carbide into China.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:41:02
Quite a diverse set of customers, highlighting the success of our G10-SiC platform. I think we've managed to establish that platform very well in the China market. That was all relating to the earlier question by John Arden. That was all for 8 inch or having 8 inch in mind. However, we are all aware of the large overcapacity in silicon carbide in China. Also, the China silicon carbide business at this point in time has slowed down. I think the market overall is digesting the existing overcapacity. I think we all see the very nice success of Chinese electric vehicles. At some point, the overcapacity will be digested and there will also be new orders.
Madeleine Jenkins

That's very helpful, thank you. Just a quick final question. Do you have a sense of how much of your current gallium nitride revenues this year, let's say, are for data center applications?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:41:58
That's honestly very difficult to predict. Sorry for having only a vague answer because our gallium nitride customers, I think we all have a couple of very big names, leading power electronics makers in mind, right. They use our platform, essentially our tools, essentially for all the applications across the board. On our tool in the same configuration, you can produce a 20 volt, 100 volt, a 650 volt, and even if you want a 1200 volt device without any change in configuration, and therefore we as a maker just send the tool as it is and the customer can do whatever the customer wants with it without a modification in those power ranges. Therefore, it's for us very difficult to predict. If there would be a different configuration by voltage range, then at least we would have an indication.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:42:51
Therefore, it's difficult for us to say, sorry, sorry for that one. Silicon carbide is different, right? 6 to 8 inch, right. It's always the customer needs a configuration and we see spare part orders or parts orders and we can at least give you here in the call a qualitative indication for the GaN. It's really one size fits all. Yeah, customer takes it and then we don't know.
Madeleine Jenkins

Next up is Ruben Devos from Capital for Growth.
Ruben Devos
Equity Research Analyst
0:43:20
Yes, good afternoon. I just had a follow up on silicon carbide, but I think you touched upon it already. It was around your comments on benefiting over proportionally when the cycle would return. I think you talked about a more diverse set of customers, so that might be an explanation, right.
Ruben Devos
Equity Research Analyst
0:43:42
Just curious around what degree of confidence you have, right, to make that statement of outgrowing the market. Even outside, like automotive, how does the pipeline shape up? You know, thinking about industrial as well in silicon carbide. Thank you.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:43:59
Thanks a lot. I think your question hints very well towards the future direction of silicon. Let me go a little deeper to expand on it. Maybe some of the backgrounds, the technical backgrounds are interesting. The first generation of silicon carbide devices which we have seen, I would say in the last five years, with a very simple MOSFET consisting essentially of just one thick layer, one thick epi layer. Now what I mentioned, the next generation of devices which to the expectation of all market participants will be the main volume in the next wave.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:44:40
Everybody expects the next wave of growth, 2027, 2028, exact timing to be TBD, to be super junction MOSFET. This is a device where this one thick layer is split into three or four thinner layers, each of them about 1/5 or 1/4 thick of the initial one. It's not just one big epi, but the wafer would be put into a tool four times. You make one thin layer, then you do some device processing and then the wafer returns to the silicon carbide epi tool, comes the next thin layer and so on, multiple times. This super junction technology shifts the operating point from one thick layer which, let's say, has in the past been deposited, let's say, in about one hour to two hours processing time, now into multiple thinner layers depending on which type of equipment.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:45:34
Let's say it now takes 15, 20, 30 minutes instead of one or two hours. The wafer gets into the equipment multiple times. With that, the complete dynamics about the productivity of the tool, the key KPIs, and so on, is shifting because essentially it's a very different operating point. You can buy, in an analogy, a car which is perfect as a city car, small and nice and fits into parking lots, but doesn't drive very fast. You don't care. A perfect travel car for long distance travel or a nice sports car for going up the mountain pathways or driving races. Each of the operating points has a different optimum. This new operating point about thin layers, to our calculations and also to the feedback we receive from customers, is very beneficial for the batch tool which we are offering.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:46:28
This is the reason why we've made these positive earlier statements. Let me come to the second part of your question. The other part of the market which may provide further growth, I think it's still a little further out than 2027, 2028, is the market for industrial applications. That market could probably towards the end of the decade grow very big. What we are talking here is about the following. Today we use the silicon carbide devices mainly in switch mode power supplies or like power devices for the car, the main inverter, and in voltages 650 to 1200 volt. We can also make silicon carbide devices which have 3,000 volt or 6,000 volt or 10,000 volt, much, much higher voltage classes. The industry is working on that. It was, for example, one of the elements in the Nvidia power architecture.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:47:25
I think everybody here in this call has the chart of the architecture. If you look at the chart of Nvidia, on the very front end, you come from the grid and you enter the grid into the data center at voltages around 14 kilovolt. That's 14,000 volt. This down conversion from over 10,000 volt, eventually down to 1,000, is done by silicon carbide, and then from 1,000 to 1 is done by gallium nitride. You cannot only use the silicon carbide in a data center for these high voltages, but in the entire grid. We all know as more and more renewables are being used worldwide, I think China leads the pack with driving down the costs of solar and wind, but the whole world is following. We need much more active grid stabilization, load management, active management, and so on and so forth.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:48:22
The worldwide power grid will experience over the next two decades massive investments into switching infrastructure. Today, this is all being done by transformers. I think everybody knows next to the highway, like these transformer stations standing. In the future, many of those will be done by active switching, and this will all be done by silicon power devices. All the leading grid suppliers, whether this is a Siemens, an ABB, a Schneider Electric, General Electric in the U.S., are working on such devices. It's a nice end segment for silicon carbide. However, I think this is a longer term trend. I would not put the years 2027, 2028 on it. I would rather put 2029 onwards as a nice trend for the turning of the decades on this trend.
Ruben Devos
Equity Research Analyst
0:49:13
All right, great. Thanks for the context, very helpful. Just my second question related to optoelectronics.
Ruben Devos
Equity Research Analyst
0:49:23
Basically, I think you've called co-packaged optics as a key driver for indium phosphide adoption. How quickly would you expect the market to move there from pilot into volume, co-packaged optic to deployment? You've very helpfully framed the tool market size for silicon carbide and gallium nitride in your slide deck. May I opportunistically ask whether you've done a similar exercise for the G10-AsP platform? Thank you.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:49:51
Thanks, thanks a lot. I take the suggestion. It's a good one. Let's take that on our action item list. He smiled around me here in the room. Yeah, it's a good one. We don't have it yet for today, so I cannot give it to you. Maybe in the next earnings call. Now to your question about the sizing and what we see for the optoelectronics market.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:50:14
Unfortunately, it is much more difficult to predict than for the GaN and for the silicon carbide market. Let me try to illustrate to you why. In GaN, in SiC, we talked at least for the main volume segment, for pretty standardized segments and types of devices. Right. For GaN we talk 20 volts, 100 volt, 650 and an exotic 1200. Silicon carbide, 650, 1200. Now I was talking a bit about the very high voltages. You can put it into two or three classes. Unfortunately, the optoelectronic market is extremely fragmented. We both see that in the number of players. I don't know, there may be a couple of hundred electronics producers and companies, while in power electronics we talk probably about maybe a dozen or two dozen, three dozens maybe at most. It's extremely fragmented and such are the different technologies which is competing with each other.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:51:14
The good thing is this is physics. They all have in common. As of today, they need a wide band gap semiconductor. Yeah. Gallium arsenide or indium phosphide for generating the light. Then the way the light is being processed, whether this is on an indium phosphide or gallium arsenide based photonic integrated circuit or whether the light coming on is put into a silicon photonics, you can use silicon, silicon silicon dioxide waveguides and switching devices. This is extremely diverse and therefore very difficult to predict. I wouldn't dare at this point to make a prediction where it goes. We are aware that all the guys who are working on the leading edge CMOS nodes and also doing heterogeneous integration, all of them work on multiple technologies.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:52:03
Even for the big guys in the industry thinking at TSMC, it's difficult to really say, this technology is winning out against the others.
Ruben Devos

Next up is Andrew Gardiner from Citi. Good afternoon.
Andrew Gardiner
Head of European Technology Equity Research
0:52:26
Thank you for taking the question. I just had one on the margin outlook into next year that you provided us, Felix, saying that you thought EBIT margin next year would be in line, perhaps better year on year. Can you just sort of give us some of the drivers there in terms of, you know, gross margin? I mean obviously you've given us the mix in terms of opto and GaN up and SiC down. How would you sort of quantify that in terms of magnitude of gross margin change next year? Also, you've done a sort of workforce reduction earlier this year.
Andrew Gardiner
Head of European Technology Equity Research
0:53:05
Given the still slow market in SiC, do you see any need to continue to reduce OpEx or are we far enough through this down cycle now where you just sort of have to weather it because you can see the long term opportunity? Really there's not much change, incremental change in terms of OpEx into next year. Thank you.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:53:25
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot for the question. I think part of the answer you've given. Let me try to give an end to end consistent picture. We were referring to EBIT margins really to bottom line. I have not given indications on the gross margin. Not more quantitative. Right. I was really mean EBIT margin. I think there's three drivers behind our indication towards. We wanted to give you a very clear indication that the margins is not getting worse yet despite the top line suffering probably a bit.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:54:01
I think there's three drivers behind it. On the one hand we see margin wise a bit stronger product mix. I indicated the gain of output that helps a lot. Secondly, we will see the full year effect of the headcount reduction which we conducted early in 2025. There's also cost and restructuring costs in 2026. We get the benefits of that. The third topic is we use the slow period of the cycle right now for some operational improvements, be it working on our storage topics, be it working on logistics topics, be it currently working on our operational efficiencies. We have quite a bunch of these things ongoing which are just making our operations more fluent, which reduce the external spend that's going out the door all the time, and we expect some of those effects to kick in.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:55:00
Based on those three effects altogether, we expect in terms of absolute terms a stable bottom line or percentage wise stable or even improved bottom line despite the probably slightly weaker top line. I think that's important in the end for you guys, also then to everybody here in this call, to give an indication where does it look on the profitability.
Andrew Gardiner
Head of European Technology Equity Research

The next question comes from Aditya Metuku from HSBC.
Adithya Metuku
Senior Analyst
0:55:37
Yeah, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, I just wondered if you could give us some clarity on what drove the push out this year. Which end market drove the reduction in outlook for the year?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:55:56
Sorry, I didn't acoustically, the line was very bad. I didn't get the question. Could you repeat it please?
Adithya Metuku
Senior Analyst
0:56:04
Sorry, apologies.
Adithya Metuku
Senior Analyst
0:56:07
I was just wondering if you could give us any color on what drove the reduction in guide in 2025. Where did you see this push out? Which end market?
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:56:17
Ah, okay, sorry. Now I get it. Thanks, thanks a lot. Honestly, this was all across the board except for the laser market. I think the laser market we've indicated is strong and continues to be strong and growing into next year. As we have just discussed, we have seen a weaker than expected GaN in silicon carbide initially as we started into the year. For us it's always very difficult to predict the full range and we have put the full guidance range accounting early in February 25th. Looking now seven months back, in our full guidance range we have accounted for both a slow market scenario which now is unfolding.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:57:10
Therefore, we now look at the lower half of the guidance and early in 2025 with the other end of the guidance we have also taken into account a more positive market environment. As we all see, the more positive market environment for power semis for electric vehicles is not yet unfolding. The upper half therefore had to be corrected now down to the lower half. We are narrowing down the lower half of the guidance.
Adithya Metuku
Senior Analyst
0:57:36
Understood, got it. Just on the LED and the micro LED markets, you talked about seeing signals of improvement. I just wondered if you could give us a bit more color on what exactly you're seeing, especially on the LED side. Is it driven by China? Is it anything construction related? Just any color you can give us on these two end markets in terms of the signals of improvement.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:58:04
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:58:06
On the LED market, this is typically almost exclusively a China-only market, I think we can say, because of cost and volume effects. We all know China is very, very strong these days on display making. It used to be, as you have indicated in your question, historically there used to be a lot of the LEDs going into construction. In China, they put these big, big walls on the skyscrapers. As we all know, the China housing bubble has collapsed. That was also the reason why the segment was dead for us for two years. Now we are seeing the classical LED market coming back with what we call fine pitch displays, and especially display backlighting, local dimming, local backlighting of display. You can achieve magnificent effects by either having white LEDs behind your LED display.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:58:57
You can create a beautiful black, or you can produce quite some nice bright colors on it with that one, and that's even going now into turning into RGB. The good news is it is revenue already today. The bad news is it makes it much more difficult for micro LED to gain ground in the televisions because the normal displays are already getting much improved quality. Let's see what it means for the micro LED. The other point which I was indicating, we still see that on micro LED research work is ongoing. We've seen some first devices. I was relating in my prepared notes to the Garmin watch, which is the first micro LED watch coming out, quite high prices and unfortunately with low battery lifetime. We are seeing that coming, and we see a lot of companies currently doing work on AR glasses and VR glasses.
Felix Grawert
CEO
0:59:52
You may have seen the glasses launched by Meta. There's much more stuff in the preparation. I think this is a new device category which will really come into the market quite soon, and we see some moderate demand for that also next year, as I've indicated in my prepared notes. Again, it's far away, to be clear, it's far away from the micro LED massive investment wave that all of us, two, three years ago, were expecting, where we would expect that micro LEDs are penetrating everything from smart watches to notebook displays and televisions. That one we are not seeing yet. We still see the research ongoing, so many companies are still working on it, but we don't have it here in our view when exactly. That's
Adithya Metuku
Senior Analyst
1:00:40
got it. Just one last question. With TSMC getting out of the GaN market, I just wondered, do you see a market for secondhand tools, for your GaN epitaxy tools, and would that affect demand maybe next year or the year after? How do you see the implications of TSMC getting out of the GaN market?
Felix Grawert
CEO
1:01:02
I see it as a bit of a reshuffle which happens normally in all the markets where there's a bit of a slowdown in the market. I think we see the same in silicon carbide. Some players are exiting, some others use the opportunity to buy some used tools to get a hold of or to get used to it and then newly to enter the market. I think it's a normal play that happens in a softer market environment for the overall market.
Felix Grawert
CEO
1:01:34
For us this has essentially no implication because whether a used tool is installed or whether a tool is installed at company A or changes the ownership and is later on installed within the factory of company B, it doesn't change the overall installed capacity in the market or doesn't change the market dynamics. For us as an equipment maker, we support customers when they need help in either way, sometimes for moving to it, for reinstalling to it, but it doesn't change or doesn't impact the market.
Adithya Metuku

Understood, thank you.

1:02:17
The next question comes from Michael Kuhn from Deutsche Bank.
Michael Kuhn
Senior Equity Research Analyst of Small and Mid Caps
1:02:20
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll start with, let's say, the usual update on 300 millimeter GaN. I think it's quite well known that Infineon Technologies is quite advanced in that context, and obviously no big surprise, they are cooperating closely with you in that regard.
Michael Kuhn
Senior Equity Research Analyst of Small and Mid Caps
1:02:48
When should we expect tool orders to arrive, and let's say outside Infineon Technologies, what's your view? How many companies are currently working on the transition and preparing orders?
Felix Grawert
CEO
1:03:00
I think with 300 millimeter GaN, the market unfolds pretty much as we have expected. If you recall, we stated earlier that we see the 300 millimeter GaN as a subsegment of the overall GaN market. Initially targeting the lower voltage classes means 100 volt, 20 volt, maybe 200 volt. Maybe at a later time, also 650, but really starting at the lower voltage classes and we get confirmation from many customers. What we had expected early on is that customers are really targeting to switch and to reuse existing silicon MOSFET or silicon IGBT capacities and to rededicate existing fab for gallium nitride.
Felix Grawert
CEO
1:03:53
Of course, customers need to buy a new EPI tool because the silicon EPI tool is a completely different tool from a gallium nitride EPI tool. In any case, there's a new tool demand for gallium nitride tools. However, the market adoption and the customer decision to the largest part depends on the installed base of factories. Customers who have today their silicon MOSFETs running in a 200 millimeter silicon fab are likely to switch to a 200 millimeter GaN tool. Customers who today are running the silicon MOSFET in a 300 millimeter fab will want to switch and rededicate their 300 millimeter fab to a 300 millimeter GaN fab. That is the market dynamic. Based on that dynamic, you know, we never comment on customers unless we have a joint press release with customers. Allow me to describe the trend without names as we always try to do.
Felix Grawert
CEO
1:04:50
We really see customers who have installed 300 millimeter silicon capacity are switching now and starting to switch and have plans. The many, many, many other customers who have 200 millimeter silicon fabs continue to work on gallium nitride 200 millimeter. As a result of that, our strategy going forward is that we will support both groups of customers. GaN 300 is not displacing GaN 200. We have our GaN 300 millimeter roadmap. We're very happy with the results that the 300 millimeter tool is giving. At the same time, we also maintain an active 200 millimeter GaN roadmap where we also work on improvements. We have multiple very close customer collaborations on 200 millimeter tool improvements or even next generation tools for 200 millimeters.
Michael Kuhn
Senior Equity Research Analyst of Small and Mid Caps
1:05:39
Understood, thank you.
Michael Kuhn
Senior Equity Research Analyst of Small and Mid Caps
1:05:43
On cash flow and working capital, given that you don't expect top line growth next year, how much more would you think you can further optimize working capital? Because I think you mentioned you see further potential also into 2026.
Christian Danninger
CFO
1:06:04
Let's focus maybe on the inventories. The rest of the working capital is always a little bit arbitrary, the receivables and the down payments. On the inventories, our key ambition is to drive them down further. It's a little bit difficult yet to predict, not knowing the exact product mix and so on. At first, high level expectation would be another 20% down. I would be more ambitious. Let's check.
Felix Grawert
CEO
1:06:41
I would say by the end of this year I would expect inventory $275 million plus $15 million, to give you a number. Let's see how close we come. Maybe next year, $200 million. Let's see, something like this.
Michael Kuhn
Senior Equity Research Analyst of Small and Mid Caps
1:06:54

Head of Investor Relations
0:00:20
Good morning, everyone. This is Aude Rodriguez, Head of Investigations. Thank you very much for attending the call today. François Jackow and Jérôme Pelletan will present the third quarter revenue. For the Q&A session, they will be joined by Emilie Mouren-Renouard and Adam Peters, both Group VP, overseeing respectively EMEA and North America. Adam is on the phone with us from the U.S. In the agenda, our next announcement is on February 20, 2025, for our full year 2024 results. Let me now hand you over to François.
François Jackow
CEO
0:00:59
Thank you, Aude, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to be with you today to walk you through the very solid achievements of the group in the third quarter of 2025. Of course, we are still operating in the same turbulent environment that has defined the market since the start of the year. Despite these conditions, I am glad to report that Air Liquide is maintaining a very strong momentum. We are delivering consistent sales growth that demonstrates far more than just resilience. We continue to grow. Also, we are firmly confident in achieving our margin improvement target, driven by the structural transformation underway across the group. At the same time, we've had, again, significant success in business development, securing new contracts, and reaching a new record high backlog. Let's turn to slide three. The numbers speak for themselves.
François Jackow
CEO
0:02:11
Sales grew +2% on a comparable basis, maintaining the same positive trajectory in spite of everything. All the key indicators are very well positioned and reflect our strong performance again this quarter. IM pricing remained accurate, increasing above 3% in Q3. This shows a sequential increase versus Q2 2025, demonstrating effective management in a demanding environment. The momentum on efficiencies remained very positive, with more than 20% growth compared to Q3 last year. This means that over the nine months, we have already delivered 15% more efficiencies than in the whole year 2022. This performance is highly encouraging, as it clearly validates that the structural efficiencies from our major transformation program are delivering. I personally like this very much, as it allows us to positively improve the margin while accelerating our investments for the future. Cash flow remains extremely robust, growing +7%, excluding the currency impact.
François Jackow
CEO
0:03:34
Our ESG KPIs remain on track in Q3. Finally, our investment backlog reached a new record high level, approaching €5 billion for the first time in our history. This is a solid, tangible indicator of future growth, which will begin to flow through as the projects under construction are going to start up. In summary, this has been a very solid quarter, perfectly aligned with the positive trend of the first half. These results provide clear evidence that we are firmly on track to deliver our commitments in terms of both current performance and future growth. You remember that last quarter, we introduced the four growth engines of the group. This is not just a concept. When we look at slide four, we see concrete wins and illustrations this quarter of how those four growth engines are in action.
François Jackow
CEO
0:04:41
First, we're talking about low CapEx growth by getting more out of our existing assets. This quarter, we signed, for example, new contracts to supply hydrogen to two of the largest U.S. refineries. This is a great example of low CapEx growth and the benefits of Air Liquide's assets. We will leverage our existing pipelines and infrastructure for new additional sales, while limiting the investment to only $15 million. We're simply integrating new compression and distribution gear. Capital intensity is around 0.5 for this project. These types of projects are clearly a reservoir of growth in a lower volume environment because it lets us boost sales without the usual capital expenditure. Our second growth engine is investing in our core activities. Our electronics leadership is a key part of this. We closed two major long-term contracts with leading semiconductor manufacturers this quarter.
François Jackow
CEO
0:05:53
The first was a €250 million investment in Dresden, Germany, our largest ever electronics investment in Europe. The second was a €130 million investment for two carrier gas units in Singapore. An additional illustration is in home health care, which is another growth driver of our core activities. In Q3, we signed a new large contract in Spain to provide home health care for patients with chronic respiratory conditions. We're investing in an innovative approach where we're using unique proprietary digital and AI solutions to ensure cost-effective personalized care. In the current very variable environment, we expect home health care to be a steady growth driver for the group. The third engine is the energy transition. A great example, confirming our leadership position in this market, is the €500 million investment we decided this quarter for the Alligator project in the port of Rotterdam.
François Jackow
CEO
0:07:04
This massive 200-megawatt electrolyzer will notably supply TotalEnergies with green hydrogen through a long-term contract. Finally, our fourth growth engine is acquisitions. In Q3, we announced the agreement to acquire DIG Air Gas in South Korea. This is highly strategic because it gives us a stronger foothold in the world's fourth largest industrial gas market, which is expected to double in the next 10 years. Critically, DIG's footprint and operations are also a perfect complement to our current activities in Korea. At this stage, the closing process is going as expected. We also continued making small targeted bolt-on acquisitions to increase density in our existing operations, like the announcement yesterday of an acquisition to strengthen our footprint in India. All in all, the first three growth engines are currently fueling our €5 billion backlog.
François Jackow
CEO
0:08:12
When you add the major DIG Air Gas acquisition and our bolt-on operation, that figure gets close to €8 billion in total capital deployment, securing future growth. Return on investment remains, of course, a key priority for the group. In spite of the increased investment in the past three years, and thanks to the improved margins, our recurring ROCE remains at plus 11% at the end of September, above the 10% threshold of the advanced target. I will conclude on slide five, showing the robustness of Air Liquide's equation in the current environment, combining very strong delivery of today's performance and steady ability to invest for the future. We proved once again in Q3 that we are on track, thanks to our proactive management of our transformation and strong position on growth opportunities.
François Jackow
CEO
0:09:13
We are highly confident in our ability to navigate the evolving global landscape and continue delivering value to our shareholders. Thank you very much for your attention. I now ask Jérôme to present the details of the Q3 performance.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:09:32
Thanks, François, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our numbers in more detail. Coming back to Q3, I'm now on slide seven. Group sales have been resilient overall, with a growth of +1.9% on the comparable basis, excluding energy pass-through and forex. There is no significant external scope effect in Q3 2025. Published sales are down -2.4%, widely due to the negative forex effect of -4.2%, mainly due to USD and the nearly neutral energy pass-through effect of -0.1%. Gas and services sales achieve a +1.9% increase year on year, and engineering and technology external sales increase +1.7%, while resources are still mostly dedicated to building the many internal projects in the backlog for large industries and electronics. I am now on slide eight. Growth in Q3 for gas and services has been driven by the Americas, while EMEA and Asia were broadly flat.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:10:37
On a business line standpoint, we can see that healthcare and industrial merchants drove growth in Q3, and electronics is also a strong growth driver if you exclude the sales of equipment and installation. This, once again, highlights the value of our diversified development strategy, capitalizing on the complementarity and right balance among our different business lines and geographies. This resilience, coupled with existing capacity, strong growth drivers, and increasing performance, as explained earlier by François, positions Air Liquide very well for the future. Let us now review more specifically the activity of each of our main geographies in Q3 2025. I am now on slide nine. Driving growth, sales in the Americas delivered a strong +5% on the comparable basis. Large industries posted strong growth despite a high comparison basis in Q3 2024.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:11:32
The business line benefited from the continued ramp-up in air gases from a major air separation unit started in February 2024, solid startup contribution, as well as lower turnarounds during the period, which more than offset lower base business, especially hydrogen, with less import of heavy fuels. As a side note, you may expect a few more turnarounds in Q3. In merchant sales, we were driven by a positive pricing effect of +4.5% year on year, which improved sequentially from Q2. Pricing was driven especially in North America by adjustment on cylinder rental in some regions at Air Gas. Gas volumes were flat, and outputs showing improvement were less negative. Bolt-on acquisitions also contributed to growth. Strong growth in healthcare was achieved through higher pricing in the U.S. and LatAm, coupled with the growing buzz of home healthcare patients.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:12:30
This growth was further supported by the development of the IntelliOx differentiated solution. It offers a digital gauge that provides caregivers with a direct reading of the remaining oxygen time, an excellent example of value creation through innovation. Finally, electronic sales posted normalizing ENI sales versus a record high level last year, offsetting strong growth in advanced materials and specialty materials. Carrier gases were resilient. Sales in EMEA were resilient, with continued solid growth in healthcare. Large industries posted a slight drop. Hydrogen sales were down in Germany, as were cogeneration in Benelux. However, positive air gases overall and robust hydrogen in the Middle East provided a partial offset. In merchants, sales were flat, with still a solid +1.5% pricing despite lower energy indexation in bulk. Volumes were driven down by liquid CO2 and helium, as anticipated. Bulk volumes showed resilience, as did packaged gas.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:13:36
To be noted, excluding the negative impacts of helium, merchant sales in Europe were up +1%. Finally, healthcare's steady +4% growth was supported by an increasing number of patients in home healthcare, which serves diabetes, sleep apnea, and community care needs in Germany. MedGas sales remain steady; Asian sales were resilient. In large industries, there was a continued contribution from startup ramp-up in China and South Korea, but offset by low-based business and a high comparison basis in Q3 2024. Sales in merchants were down -1%, or up slightly, excluding the impact from helium. The regions saw improving pricing at -0.5% versus -1% in the second quarter of this year. China posted a positive +2% sales growth and above +4%, excluding helium, with the growth mainly driven by bulk and onsite. Pricing remains weak in China, hampered by helium and the deflationary environment, as anticipated.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:14:40
Activity in the rest of Asia was more mixed. Electronic sales were flat overall, but were above +6%, excluding ENI, which is normalizing after a record year. Carrier gases maintained a double-digit sales growth, and advanced materials showed growth, while specialty materials were soft. I will now turn to slide 10, where I will comment on our Q3 activity by business line. In merchants, we saw an increase in pricing to +3.1% compared to +2.7% in the second quarter. Overall, volume in gases was slightly up, including bolt-on acquisition, and output volumes were less negative, improving sequentially. The main end markets posted volume growth were secondary electronics and packaging globally, materials and utilities in the U.S., and automotive in Asia. In large industries, startup and ramp-up contribution offset lower demand. Major ramp-up indeed has positively contributed in the U.S.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:15:41
and Asia, offsetting lower demand, mainly in EMEA and Asia, while the base business was more resilient in the Americas. Slide 11, electronics, where we continue to build our leadership position, continues to grow at +6%, excluding ENI. Carrier gases delivered indeed strong growth, with eight main startups year to date, mainly in China, Taiwan, and Japan. Carrier gases and solid advanced materials in China and U.S. almost fully offset, normalizing ENI sales, which are more cyclical and compared to a record high in 2024. Electronic specialty materials were flat overall. Finally, healthcare continues strong growth, again, sorry, high comparable rates last year. Growth mainly comes from home healthcare, notably in Europe and South America, from medical gases in the Americas, and from specialty ingredients.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:16:40
On slide 12 now, as a reminder, our margin improvement objective is supported by a structured plan leveraging our unique strengths and based on three pillars. First, IM pricing continues to be solid despite a high comparable basis, as you see on the graph. To be noted, we have an uptick in pricing from Q2 to Q3, despite the lower index in bulks in EMEA, and we continue to focus on price management and pass-through price versus cost dynamics. Regarding efficiencies, as François mentioned, the strong performance of a +23% increase demonstrates that the structural initiatives from our major transformation program are delivering and strongly supplementing our ongoing efficiency program. This impact is, of course, positive on our margin, as it helps to compensate for some headwind, such as unfavorable currency impact. Lastly, we have continued to actively manage and optimize our portfolio.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:17:42
We have indeed closed eight bolt-on acquisitions year to date, as well as announced our agreement to acquire DIG Air Gas in South Korea, as François mentioned. Meanwhile, we executed three divestitures. Air Liquide continues to focus on strategic, profitable, and margin accurate opportunities. On slide 13 now, the 12-month portfolio of opportunities remains stable at a high level of €4.1 billion. Our total industrial and financial decisions for the quarter were also high at €924 million. This including the FID for the Alligator electrolyzer project in the Netherlands, the electrification of a net separation unit in China, and a large carrier gas project for a leading electronic customer in Germany. Finally, our investment backlog reached a new record level of €4.9 billion, with investment decisions entering the backlog more than offsetting medium-sized startups leaving the backlog.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:18:39
Projects in electronics represent one-third of our total backlog, in line with our growing leadership in the segment. We achieved €233 million of sales contribution for startup and ramp-up year to date, and we remain confident to deliver at least €310 million by year end. To conclude, in spite of the current turbulent environment, thanks to the ongoing demonstrated resilience of our business model and our disciplined self-help actions, we confirmed our guidance. Thank you for your attention. We can now open the Q&A session. Back to you, François.
François Jackow
CEO
0:19:15
Thank you very much, Jérôme. Let's start the Q&A session. Thanks.
Operator
0:19:22
Thank you so much. Dear participants, as you're aware, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one one on the top right keypad and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw a question, please press star one one again. Ms. Campbell will compile the Q&A queue. This will take a few moments. Now we're going to take our first question. It comes from the line of John Campbell from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
John Campbell
Analyst
0:19:49
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions, too, if I can quickly. I wanted to get a sense for the feeling you maybe have on the activity levels in the fourth quarter. It looks to me like organic growth in the third quarter was slightly stronger, perhaps, than some had expected. It looks like in several areas, such as large industries or healthcare, the year-on-year comparison basis gets sequentially noticeably easier in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Any comments you could perhaps give on the fourth quarter and even looking further ahead, perhaps into 2026 for the electronics segment, where organic growth has been perhaps slightly sullied by normalizing equipment sales? That's the first question. The second one, if I can, relates to any of the latest details you can give us on amendments related to the corporate tax rate in France. I noticed there were some potential revisions in an amendment yesterday evening. Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:20:50
Thank you very much, John, and good morning. Regarding the trend, I think overall we are in the same kind of environment. What we have seen in Q3 is, to some extent, an acceleration of the growth in some segments at the end of Q3. To some extent, Q3 was better than what was maybe expected at the beginning of Q3. That's positive news for sure. We do expect Q4 to be above Q3. Again, in the current environment, we have to be cautious. I mean, there's so much variation in the end market and so many things happening from one week to another one, I would say. Overall, the trend should be positive. We do expect momentum to continue in the Americas overall, and also some comparison effect being positive in Europe overall. Regarding the key markets, indeed, as we mentioned, large industries should see some pickup.
François Jackow
CEO
0:22:04
We do expect the same probably for industrial merchants, mostly driven by the U.S., as we have seen in the past quarter. Electronics overall is probably likely to be flat. Let's keep in mind what Jérôme has mentioned about the comparison effect, which is still quite strong. Healthcare is remaining very strong and should continue its progression. All in all, Q4 should see continuous momentum and improvement. Again, in the current environment, let's be careful. You know very well that our strategy has been very clear that in the current environment, and regardless of the environment, we are determined to improve the margin with many actions, which are self-help actions. The transformation program that we are doing is contributing clearly. That should give us a good visibility and good confidence for Q4, regardless of the environment. Jérôme, comments on the French corporate tax?
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:23:15
Thank you very much, John, for this important question. I would say for the question you raise on what's happening right now, it's a bit difficult to comment. It's a discussion. We have potentially amendments, but nothing has been voted yet. I will not comment on the impact of 2026. What I can tell you at least for 2025 and something we already mentioned, the effective tax rate that we can expect for the year 2025 should be around 26%, which is something which is coming mainly from the impact of the ROAT finance for 2025. For 2026, it's a bit early. Of course, we'll come back later when we have more certainty on the topic. Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:23:59
Thank you very much, Jérôme. Thank you, John. Next question, please.
Operator
0:24:03
Thank you. Just give us a moment, now we're going to take our next question. It comes to the line of Alejandro Bello from Santander. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Alejandro Bello
Analyst
0:24:13
Yes. Hello. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is about the investment backlog you highlighted in 2025. The contribution of this backlog is about €300 million, €340 million. If you can give us some guidance or some outlook about next year, your expectations of the contribution from the new projects, from the startups. The second question is about the self-help programs you mentioned about efficiencies. We have seen this acceleration of more than 20% year to date. If you can elaborate about which are the sources of these additional efficiencies and the outlook for next year as well, if you can continue to generate these efficiencies. Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:25:00
Merhaba, good morning. Thank you very much for those two questions. Jérôme, do you want to take the two questions, actually?
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:25:06
Yes, François, I can take it. As related to the backlog, you're right. The backlog is a record high, nearly €5 billion. It's a historical backlog. Of course, just to remind you, it's made by projects that are signed so that we deliver growth in the coming years. We are pretty clear, you know, that for this year, the impact would be at least €310 million. That's where we stand right now for the contribution. As you see, it starts to be a significant contribution on the top line. As related to efficiencies, you're right. Also, we're very happy with the trend on the efficiency and plus 23% versus last year. As François said, we're at a number that represented the full-year impact of 2022. Just have in mind that these efficiencies are rising. They are multiple.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:25:57
You know, that's the result of the transformation program that we are, you know, that we're executing right now, that we're already commenting many times. There are different folders. There is, of course, an acceleration in industrial efficiencies. You know that we have created the Group Industrial Efficiency, the Group Industrial Direction. This is accelerating, and we're very happy with the trend coming. We have also an acceleration in procurement as well, which is also delivering. We have also a contribution for all the restructuring measures that we are setting, which are also delivering. All in all, plus 23% is a strong number, and it's much better than what we're able to do in the past. We can be very happy with, of course, the impact on the margin that we're translating into.
François Jackow
CEO
0:26:44
Thank you very much, Jérôme. Next question, please.
Operator
0:26:50
Yes, of course. Now we're going to proceed to our next question, and it comes to the line of Thomas P. Wrigglesworth from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Wrigglesworth
Equity Analyst
0:27:00
Thanks very much for the opportunity to ask questions. If I may, firstly, on the large industries Europe, you call out hydrogen in Germany. Is that purely the force majeure, or are you seeing other impacts weighing on that market? Secondly, kind of more of a longer-term question. Obviously, CBAM is coming in next year. Do you think that will drive an acceleration in the investment opportunities set that you see? Do you think people are going to start to react now to CBAM, and there's been a wait and see? Alternatively, do you think people will now start to look to shift capacity out of Europe into other geographies because of CBAM and the fact that it's actually more efficient to do more environmental/green/renewable projects in the Middle East and the U.S.? Any comments there would be very helpful. Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:28:02
Thank you very much, Tom. I will ask Emilie to speak about the hydrogen in Germany, and I will comment on the CBAM.
Emilie Mouren-Renouard
Group VP EAMEI
0:28:11
Yes. Thank you, François. Good morning, everyone. On the hydrogen in Germany, it's mostly related to events at our customers indeed. We shouldn't read too much into that. Overall, in Germany, the business and the activity was resilient, which given the current context is already good news. You've seen some good level also of project development. You've seen recently the ELBE announcement where we are investing €250 million in Germany in the semiconductor industry. You see the economy, despite the headwinds, is resilient. We also hope that the infrastructure fund driven by the German government will deliver results and positive impact on us. We shouldn't read too much into this hydrogen in Germany, mostly due to customers.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:29:09
Thank you very much, Emilie. Regarding CBAM, you're absolutely right, Tom. This is coming into force in Europe. It's going to create a new environment. It's a little bit early to say exactly what's going to happen in the industry. If I step back and I look at the impact for Air Liquide, I think overall it's going to be a positive trend because at the end of the day, it's really putting value on carbon and low-carbon products. Today we see industries which are getting organized in Europe to drive decarbonization, for sure. What we see also, and I had many discussions with customers in different geographies, is that they are starting to decarbonize their own processes to be able to import to Europe. This is the case, for sure, in China, which is driving decarbonization opportunities in China, but also in the Middle East and in the U.S.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:30:12
As you know, we are clearly a leader in terms of solutions to decarbonize the manufacturing processes. We will capture the opportunities being in Europe or being in the other countries. All in all, I think it's a very positive signal towards the decarbonization of the industry.
Thomas Wrigglesworth
Equity Analyst
0:30:32

Now we're going to take our next question. The question comes to the line of Tony Jones from Rothschild & Co. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Tony Jones
Analyst
0:30:46
Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I've got two questions, if I may, too. On comparable growth, good results at 2%, but I just wanted to break it down into the growth factors. If I weigh price from merchants, that gets me to about 1.3%, 1.4% of the group. New projects just over 1%. That implies underlying volumes are down around 1%. I think, firstly, is that correct? Secondly, is that the right sort of run rate we should be thinking as we go into the early part of 2026? My question is on uses of cash. Air Liquide's not got a lot of debt, and your choices are either cash return or CapEx. Instead, we've seen more acquisitions. Could you talk a little bit about the selection criteria for that? When you're making your acquisitions, is this about accessing new growth or a clear margin expansion? Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:31:54
Thank you very much. For the first question, Jérôme, do you want to comment on that? I will make some comments on the strategy for the acquisitions.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:32:03
On the comparable sales, you know, we are basically having, I can break it down rapidly by subsegment. That would be helpful. In merchants, we have +2.7% growth, with pricing at +3.1%, with improved volume. In large industries, we have basically startup contributions that offset low demand. Electronics, we have growth, but you know it's negative because we have a strong ENI comparable last year. In healthcare, it's growth, you know, coming from volume and price. As regards to volume coming in the months to come, it's a bit difficult to say. You know, we're quite cautious. Overall, we see better, I would say, better volume, especially in our goods. We're still negative orange in the U.S., for example, but it's much lower than last year. All in all, we can see that the trend in Q3 was better than before. Now, maybe you want me to talk about the cash?
François Jackow
CEO
0:33:06
We'll talk about the more, I mean, the strategy for the acquisition. The first thing is that thanks to all the improvements in the profitability, as you mentioned, the cash flow of the group has increased significantly. We have basically the means to deliver and to execute our strategy. The first priority is to invest our core business. You see, and Jérôme mentioned it, we are deciding on new investment. We have a very strong backlog, and we can afford basically to take the opportunity and to seize the opportunities in our core markets and core opportunities. That's number one. Number two, clearly, we have also the means to make acquisitions. When we are making acquisitions, there are different types of acquisitions. There are the bolt-on acquisitions, which are mostly present in IM and in home healthcare.
François Jackow
CEO
0:34:04
The purpose is to increase the density, to take position, to consolidate some key markets, or sometimes to enter into new areas which can complement what we have. Typically, what we have done in India is the illustration of that, a very good complementarity to our existing footprint, allowing to cover better some key markets. At the same time, there are some strategic opportunities, whether we see the opportunity to take position in key markets. The one that we have done in South Korea is exactly this. It's positioning us for the future and for the growth. As I mentioned, and Jérôme mentioned that previously, of course, when we look at the acquisition, there is a strategic fit and the opportunity to grow. Our acquisitions are there to grow the business and to develop the business.
François Jackow
CEO
0:35:04
Of course, we are looking at the positive contribution of those acquisitions, either because those are existing businesses with good profitability or because we see synergies and integration. Typically, the bolt-on acquisitions, for example, the one that we are doing in the U.S. or in China, are in this category. We can improve the profitability because of the integration in a much larger and more efficient organization. Once again, this is part of the capital allocation of the group, targeting growth, but of course, contributing positively to the net profit improvement of the group.
Tony Jones
Analyst
0:35:44
Thank you. That's really helpful. Appreciate it.
François Jackow
CEO
0:35:47
Thank you very much. Let's take the next question, please.
Operator
0:35:51
Yes, of course. Just give us a moment. The next question comes to the line of Chetan Uttashy from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Operator
0:36:01
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of questions. First is on your pricing in merchant in the U.S. You're noting some of that is because of the higher cylinder rentals. I'm just curious whether this is more a pass-through of higher running costs because I suppose you also have to pay more for sourcing these cylinders, or is this real incremental sort of, you know, benefit for Air Liquide from higher pricing in the U.S.? The second one was in your Large Industries business. I'm a bit surprised that Asia underlying is weak because, you know, especially in chemicals, when we look at the production of chemicals in China, it's been growing very, very strongly at the expense of, of course, Europe. I was surprised that Asia is actually not up in terms of onsite. Any indication on dynamics in Asia? Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:37:03
Thank you very much, Chetan, and good morning. Adam, can you speak a little bit about what we see in the merchant in the U.S. and the good momentum overall?
Adam Peters
CEO North America
0:37:17
Yes, absolutely, François. Chetan, thanks for the question. Looking at the IM business in the U.S. in particular, I'll speak to the pricing point as well. I think we've seen, obviously, a resilience in the gas side, which has been great, and that's maintaining well. We've seen sort of an inflection point on the hard goods piece. This is a positive piece that we've seen, particularly towards the end of the quarter. It's a little bit early to say that there's a trend in terms of volumes on the hard goods side, but certainly a nice inflection towards the end of the quarter, which is great. On the pricing in particular, we always try to stay ahead of the cost curve. What we do is we monitor very closely, as you know, price pass-through and making sure that what we do from a pricing standpoint contributes positively to margins.
Adam Peters
CEO North America
0:38:11
This is very well ingrained into our normal operating model for all of our associates across the U.S. in terms of our pricing campaigns, our pricing tools, and the like. We maintain a good momentum in that regard. Even when we think forward about cost increases related to inflation and the like, our goal is to stay ahead of the cost curve and make sure that what we do from a pricing standpoint is accretive to our margins.
François Jackow
CEO
0:38:40
Thank you very much, Adam. Regarding the large industry in Asia, I think, Chetan, what you should look at is clearly the different impacts. We have seen a positive contribution of startups of the business, but clearly, there has been significant turnaround in some key facilities impacting us. I think what you should read there is mostly the impact of the outage and the maintenance at some key customers, especially on the AECO business, but also Air Gas in some cases, especially in China. That is probably the reason for the uncorrelated performance of large industry in Asia compared to what we see from the demand side. Again, it's mostly related to specific maintenance and turnaround at customer sites.
François Jackow
CEO
0:39:43
Are these turnarounds in chemicals, I suppose? Because AECO.
François Jackow
CEO
0:39:48
Yes. Those are mostly chemicals. The AECO, it's mostly the gas supply, and the Air Gas also is mostly for the chemical. That's why you see this impact.
François Jackow
CEO
0:40:01
Understood. Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:40:03
All right. Thank you very much. Next question, please.
Operator
0:40:07
Yes, of course. We are going to take our next question. It comes to the line of Jean-Luc Romain from CIC Market Solutions. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Jean-Luc Romain
Research Analyst
0:40:18
Yes. Good morning. I would like to have a little more information about your project.
François Jackow

0:40:24
Jean-Luc, sorry, can you speak up? It's difficult to hear you.
Jean-Luc Romain
Research Analyst
0:40:30
I would like to have a little more details about your acquisition project in India. How does it compare to the acquisition project in South Korea? I think it's smaller, but I would love to have an idea of the relative size between both companies. My understanding is that the company you're buying in India is a kind of a subsidiary of, or was the subsidiary of a Chinese industrial gases company.
François Jackow
CEO
0:41:02
Thank you very much, Jean-Luc. I will ask Emilie to speak about this nice acquisition in India.
Emilie Mouren-Renouard
Group VP EAMEI
0:41:13
Good morning, Jean-Luc. Yes, we've announced that we are in the process of acquiring Novair, this industrial gases company in India. It's a small acquisition. It's below €100 million. It's a small scope. It's really very different, obviously, from the acquisition we are doing in South Korea. It's a bolt-on acquisition, like we said. It's to both densify and extend our presence in India, like François explained. Remember, we are present, or we've been present in India since 1992, both in the gas and service business, as well as engineering and construction. We have a department there which is growing, several manufacturing entities in India, and we just inaugurated our global capacity center there in Pune. Overall, this will expand our presence in India, which we consider to be really an area for growth. It's really well aligned with our growth ambition in this country.

Jean-Luc, I think if I heard correctly, you are mentioning, is that a subsidiary of a Chinese company? It's a private equity fund, PAG, who is the owner. That's why maybe you thought that. It was a private equity fund who owned that company before.

François Jackow
CEO
0:42:47
Thank you very much. We have a next question, please.
Operator
0:42:54
Yes, of course. We're going to take the next question. It comes to the line of Laura Farfret from BNP. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Operator
0:43:03
Yes. Thank you and good morning. Two questions, please. The first one is on helium. It seems to be getting worse to the point where Gazprom is reported to delay the second stage of their expansion. You're now talking about pressure in Europe as well. Can you help us understand the magnitude of the worsening for you? Also, how do you see the risk of a spillover also coming to the U.S.? I understand there are sanctions, but it seems that the sanctions are not really having any impact, certainly on your European business. The second question for Jérôme on the $100 million positive impact from the accelerated cash depreciation in the U.S. Is it 100% of the potential for you at this stage, or is there more to come? Also, can you talk about the magnitude of the equivalent measures in Germany? I think that's also something that they are working on from next year.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:43:57
Good morning, Laurent. Thank you very much. For the helium overall, let's keep in mind that helium represents 3% to 4% of the turnover of Air Liquide. In terms of impact on the sales, it's quite limited overall. We have seen the market being clearly disturbed by, as you mentioned, from the sourcing piece, Russia and Gazprom, with some products flowing in some regions of the world which are not following the sanction on this. Also, from the demand side, we have seen lower demand in some key markets. As far as Air Liquide is concerned, we are managing this business very tightly. The impact on the negative in terms of volume and what we see in some markets on spot pricing is very limited. Keep in mind that we have worked a lot on the supply chain by diversifying our sources of helium.
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
0:45:04
We are not taking any product from Gazprom, of course, but also having the cavern, which is for us a great way to manage the fluctuation between the market demand and the production side. Also, and it's very important in the current timing, we have developed, I would say, an original marketing approach in the past few years where we have converted many of our contracts to medium-term to long-term contracts. Probably 70% to 80% of our volumes are under those types of contracts, which is giving us very good stability and visibility in terms of market. This is true for the IM market, but also for the electronics market, which is growing. All in all, yes, there are some disruptions in this market today, but I think we are managing that very well overall as far as we are concerned. For the Jérôme.
François Jackow
CEO
0:46:11
Yes, of course. Thank you very much, Jérôme. Good to hear you. You're right. The recent adoption of the OBB legislation, bonus tax depreciation, allows for 100% tax for fiscal depreciation on new projects, which is a significant increase because we have 60% in 2024 and 40% in 2021. The impact in Q3, we are benefiting from a one-off positive cash impact of $100 million. Q1, Q2, Q3 figures, and that's where we are today. We will continue to benefit from this increase in the fiscal depreciation because, you know, we'll continue to invest in the U.S., as you know. Definitely, it's a very good thing for the cash flow. As related for Germany, you know, there are discussions on corporate tax, I know, but it's a bit early to say. Of course, we'll come back to you when we have more clarity on that regard, if I may say so long. Thank you very much, Jérôme. We have another question, please.
Operator
0:47:19
Yes, of course. We are going to take our next question. It comes to the line of Geoffrey Robert Haire from UBS. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Geoffrey Robert Haire
Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director
0:47:27
Yeah. Hi, Garth Larson. Good morning. I just wanted to ask quickly about the backlog, obviously going up to $4.9 billion. Could you just give some explanation as to what growth you've seen? With the DIG Air Gas acquisition, what do you expect that to add to the backlog when we get into 2026 when the deal is completed?
François Jackow
CEO
0:47:49
Thank you very much, Geoff. Maybe let's comment a little bit by geography, what we see in the backlog, and what we see in terms of business development opportunities. Adam, do you want to comment on quickly what you have in the backlog and what you see in terms of business development opportunities, both, I guess, in AI and electronics? Same for Emilie, maybe in the key region?
Adam Peters
CEO North America
0:48:13
Yes, absolutely, François. Starting with the Americas, and Geoff, thanks for the question. The backlog remains strong. I think one of the comments that François made was around the four growth engines that we have. If we look at existing assets and how to leverage those, that certainly plays into our backlog. It's a low-capital intensity growth that we see happening in the near term, which is great. We don't have to wait for full construction on those assets to deliver on those hydrogen opportunities that we see right around the corner. This is one that we see contributing to growth in the near term, being 2026, 2027. When we look at other opportunities, we see we have a number of projects which are under execution today in the electronics space in North America, as well as in the typical large industry space across the U.S.
Adam Peters
CEO North America
0:49:09
and a little bit in Canada. The development piece continues to be extremely robust for us in North America. This is one where we're looking at not only the development on the energy transition side, where we continue to follow that very, very closely, including projects like ExxonMobil, which continue to be developing well. We also see it in other areas on the traditional side of industrial gases, around the steel sector, around refining, and the like, and certainly on the electronics space. The backlog continues to be strong in North America, and the development activity continues to be very strong as well. Maybe I'll stop there and turn it over to Emilie.
François Jackow
CEO
0:49:52
Thank you very much, Adam. Emilie.
Emilie Mouren-Renouard
Group VP EAMEI
0:49:54
Thank you, François and Adam. In Europe, I would say the business development is still very active. Two things. On the backlog first, we still have a good backlog. The projects that are in our backlog are strong. They are with long-term contracts, with solid customers. They progress as planned, and they will deliver results. We've had two additional projects like you've seen: ALBE in the semiconductor industry in Germany and Alligator electrolyzer in the Netherlands for a 200-megawatt electrolyzer. Backlog, again, is strong and solid. For what is being developed right now, we continue to see a good pipeline of opportunities and active project development, I would say both in energy transition as well as in other activities, core activities. Two other sectors where we see maybe the most drive are RFNBO hydrogen. There's still room here for good projects with strong customers, and we have solid uptakers.
Emilie Mouren-Renouard
Group VP EAMEI
0:51:02
Second, in the cement industry, cement players are continuing on their journey for decarbonization. We are here to support them, and we have active discussions with them. Overall, I would say momentum is still here. You've heard the recent wins and really major ones in Europe. Air Liquide continues to be in a leading position in energy transition and overall broadly in the industry in Europe. We are well positioned to seize any opportunities whenever and wherever they happen.
François Jackow
CEO
0:51:36
Thank you very much, Emilie. Maybe I will conclude with Asia. I know because Emilie is very positive about Europe, and she's right, actually, because we see quite a bit of opportunities for sure. I will conclude with Asia and close the loop on your question, Geoff. We see a sustained pipeline of opportunities in Asia for sure. There are two main drivers as far as we see currently. The first one is electronics, clearly, where we see again and again a strong pipeline of projects, which, by the way, give us the opportunity to be quite selective in terms of strategy and in terms of profitability for the project. As we are number one globally and number one in Asia, I think clearly we see this as a strong potential.
François Jackow
CEO
0:52:32
We continue to see projects being developed around decarbonization, either around carbon capture or conversion of some units to limit the carbon footprint, which, by the way, closes the loop to what we mentioned before about the CBAM. A great illustration of that is the momentum that we see in China, still very strong, both in terms of electronics along all the types of demand in the electronics industry, but also decarbonization, mostly conversion of some projects using steam from coal towards electricity, with a very significant carbon footprint reduction. Extremely positive for the planet, but also for us as we are able to secure long-term contracts. There's probably more to come soon on that topic. In other countries, we see also, depending on the country momentum, you had a specific question about Korea and DIG. Of course, we still need to wait for the closing to happen.
François Jackow
CEO
0:53:38
As I mentioned before, everything is well online. We have a very solid portfolio of projects. We have more than 20 projects which are under execution within DIG. We do expect this to contribute. This is not taking into account what should come, which is the next wave of major electronics investment in Korea, driven mostly by AI, with some of the key players who have announced the project but not yet launched the start of the project. All in all, very strong pipeline of projects in Asia. I do believe we have maybe two more questions before we stop. The first one, please.
Operator
0:54:26
Yes, of course. The question comes to the line of Georgina Fraser from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Georgina Fraser
Equity Research Analyst
0:54:37
Thank you so much. Good morning, everyone. I've got two questions. The first one, if we can just really zoom out, how do you explain the lack of growth in Large Industries over the last four years and what's needed to resolve that situation? The second question is, the super strong backlog, it does seem like despite all of our fears, the energy transition is still a big part of the driver of the backlog. Can you talk about how the capital intensity of the backlog is evolving? Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
0:55:11
Thank you very much, Georgina, and good morning. Good to hear you. The first one on the large industry, clearly, we have mixed trends in this segment. We have seen projects, and we are investing on projects mostly driven by the energy transition. At the same time, we have seen the declining base or declining volumes in many of the industrial locations. Those are the two effects. Taking into account that it's quite stabilized today in terms of decrease in the volume in most of the region of the world, the most impacted one has been Europe, clearly. If you look at the operating rate of the large industry assets in Europe, it's lower than usual for sure. For the U.S., it has been stabilizing overall.
François Jackow
CEO
0:56:11
When we talk about the new project and the contribution of the new project, you have seen quite a bit of investment, as we discussed before. We have to take into account that only a small portion of the new investment in large industries is already startup and contributing. Keep in mind that many of those projects, they take three to four years to build, especially the one in the energy transition, which are a little bit longer. You don't see the full benefits of the new investment in large industries, which means that all in all, the new startup and the small contribution of the new investment barely compensate the decline in the volume. Again, this is a segment where we have clearly a reservoir of growth. The contract that we signed in the U.S. is a clear illustration of that.
François Jackow
CEO
0:57:07
With only a small investment, we were able to leverage our existing pipeline and existing assets, which were not fully loaded, and get new sales at a very low capital intensity. What is needed is basically a demand, underlying demand. Whenever it will happen, we are in a very well-positioned to capture this growth with no or minimum CapEx in large industries. Regarding the backlog and the capital intensity in the backlog, I think overall, the capital intensity is a little bit more difficult to read than previously for different reasons, as I explained before to some of you. Clearly, we see that the capital intensity, which is the ratio between how much capital you invest and how much sales you get, is directly impacted by the cost and the price of energy. Today, we see that the price of energy is very different from one region to another one.
François Jackow
CEO
0:58:18
This means that the capital intensity of the backlog is highly dependent on the geographical split of the project within that backlog. That's one element. The second element is that we see that in the energy transition, there are more projects where, for example, the customer is supplying the renewable electricity. That's the case for TotalEnergies in Normandy. We basically sell to them, I mean, the hydrogen, which means that at the end of the day, the capital intensity of this part of the project is higher than a classical project, which means that all in all, it's very difficult to predict. It's a little bit higher probably than a few years ago when the energy overall was quite low in terms of price because on average, the energy is higher.
François Jackow
CEO
0:59:12
That's what I can say for this capital intensity, which leads me to another point, which is the fact that in the future, it's going to be more and more difficult to use the capital intensity the same way, ratio of sales versus the investment. What you should be looking at is the return of the capital implied and employed, and then looking at how much profit or EBITDA is generated by the investment, which I think would be a much better way to see the contribution to the growth of the investment that we are doing. I hope that was clear, Georgina.

Thank you. We are going to take our last question for today. Just give us a moment. The question comes to the line of James Hooper from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
James Hooper
VP and Senior Research Analyst
1:00:14
Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I've got two final ones, please. Firstly, on electronics, on the slides that you showed, it was plus 6%, excluding ENI. Can you give us some indication of when you expect ENI to get more positive? Thinking about the component parts of the growth, how do you expect this to evolve in the coming quarters and years? Secondly, about China and the Asia business. The plan was last week, and the initial details of the five-year plan have come out for China. How do you think that, going forward, this will affect your Chinese business? What do you think it means for demand in the rest of the region? Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
1:01:02
Thank you very much, James. For the first one, Jérôme, do you want to comment on the electronics, and I will comment on China?
Jérôme Pelletan
CFO
1:01:12
Thank you very much, James. You're right to underline the fact that the growth on the electronics is very solid on carrier gas. You know, carrier gas has gone double digits, which is, again, very, very strong. We expect this growth to continue in the years to come because that very much reflects our leadership in this side. For ENI, it's a bit difficult because, you know, by definition, it's more volatile. We expect this to be more normalized during the current course of the next year, maybe around Q2 probably. Again, don't pay too much attention on this because, by definition, it's a more volatile market. Thank you.
François Jackow
CEO
1:01:59
Thank you very much, Jérôme. On China, as you mentioned, last week, there was the big meeting to set basically the course for the next few years. It is a little bit too early to conclude on exactly what's going to be the contribution. Overall, what we can take already out of the discussion and some of the communication is clearly that there is a strong focus on industry and manufacturing to make sure that it stays a key pillar in the economic development of the country. At the same time, the decarbonization is still, of course, on the agenda. I think those are very important for us overall, given our footprint and our offering to the market. I see that as being positive and potentially very positive for the growth opportunity in China.
François Jackow
CEO
1:02:52
I think one of the effects clearly which is needed is to continue to build the confidence of the end market, taking into account that this is one of the key factors to increase also the local spending in China, which is something which is important for the state of the economy. All in all, clearly, we can see that already as a sign for more quality growth in China, in the industry. Again, given our footprint, we will be able to seize those opportunities, being in the industrial merchant overall, in the electronics, or in the large industry. Thank you very much. We will conclude this session. Thanks again for all your questions. I would like to just quickly summarize some key takeaways. In Q3, we once again deliver continuous growth and, as you have seen, a strong operational performance. All this while, and we discussed quite a bit, successfully.
François Jackow
CEO
1:04:00
Projects for the future. Combining our four growth engines with our ongoing transformation, we are, with all the management team, fully confident in our ability to navigate these turbulent times. We will continue to deliver both on performance targets and growth, creating value for our shareholders. Thank you very much for your attention, and we wish all of you a very good day. Bye-bye.

Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:00:44
Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to tell you about these nine months. First of all, about the market. At slightly over +3% in the first nine months, the global market remains dynamic. In that context, our like-for-like growth sequentially accelerated, reaching +4.9% in the third quarter. That is, of course, adjusted for our IT transformation in the U.S. last year. As promised, the contribution from our Beauty Stimulus Plan accelerated. We rolled out our first half innovations and launched new products, including our two latest fragrances, Prada Paradoxe and Miu Miu Mutiny. Both are off to a good start. If I had to name some of my key highlights for the first nine months, I would say the following.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:01:31
First, the gradual recovery in our two largest markets, Mainland China, where we clearly outpaced the market, and the U.S., where CPD gained market share in each of its categories for the first time since 2021, proof that innovation really is a game changer in beauty. Second, the ongoing strength in hair care and fragrances, now 30% of our sales, but also the bounce back in makeup, where we grew almost three times above the market. Third, the continued dynamism in e-commerce that plays to our strength, enabling us to outperform in the fastest growing channel. On Saturday night, we announced the acquisition of Kering Beauty, including the Creed niche fragrance brand, as well as the beauty and fragrances licenses of Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and, when available, Gucci. I'm extremely excited about this transaction.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:02:27
Not only does it cement our existing leadership in luxury beauty, I also see enormous potential for each one of these four brands. We have proved our ability to turn licenses into billionaires. Today, YSL is as big in beauty as it is in fashion. Prada crossed the €500 million mark just four years after joining the L'Oréal Luxe family. The future to Ruth smells good, and I look forward to writing this new chapter. I'm truly delighted to do it with Kering, a trusted partner for more than a decade and a half. With that, we are all ready to take your questions.
Operator
0:03:06
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. If you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. Please use your handset before asking your question and set your microphone on mute when you ask your questions. The first question is from Guillaume Gerard Vincent Delmas of UBS. Please go ahead.
Guillaume Delmas
Analyst
0:03:32
Good evening, Nicolas, Christophe, Laurent, Eva. Good evening. Two questions for me. The first one on North America, because you had a slow start to the year. If I remember well, market growth accelerated from the middle of Q2. I think since then, we've seen some pretty impressive scanner data for L'Oréal, particularly during the months of summer. A bit surprised that your adjusted like-for-like in North America was 3% in Q3. That seems to be a little bit of a deceleration compared to your adjusted like-for-like of, I think, around 5% in Q2. Could you maybe help us unpack what looks like an apparent slowdown? Is it maybe because of a material discrepancy between sell-out, selling in the region? Any color on this performance would be helpful. My second question on North Asia.
Guillaume Delmas
Analyst
0:04:30
It's always a bit of a mixed bag with contrast developments between travel retail, Mainland China, and Japan. Wondering if you could touch a little bit on all the different moving parts for Q3 and what did drive this material step up in like-for-like. Maybe more of a crystal ball exercise at this stage, but any indications on the upcoming 11/11 and whether the nice developments seen in Mainland China in Q3 could be maintained or even accelerated in the first quarter. Thank you very much.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:05:03
Okay, so we'll share the first question with Christophe, and I'll tell you about the news from the market itself and our performance. Then we'll try to explain the differences between selling and sell-out. I think the first and most important thing to say is that we've indeed seen a real acceleration of the North American, particularly the U.S. market over the year. As you said, over the summer, our outperformance has increased, particularly in CPD, where we were below market for the beginning of the year, and we have accelerated. If I look at the total beauty market, excluding hygiene, where we don't compete in the U.S., Q1 was flat, Q2 was at +2%, and Q3, which was around 3.9% or close to 4%.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:06:03
It's a real acceleration of the market, and we've been indeed outperforming the market in North America thanks to an acceleration in mass, a continuous stellar performance in PPD in the Professional Division, which is even before the addition of Color Wow, which joined us in September, was really great. LOF has been pretty consistent, overall, overperforming the market. LDB is recovering. Fantastic performance of SkinCeuticals, good performance of La Roche-Posay, and CeraVe has finally gone back into a slightly positive territory, not just because of hair care, which is doing good, but also because thanks to moisturizers. Christophe, on the discrepancies between selling and sell-out, and that overall, as you can hear, I'm pretty bullish for the U.S., and I'm very happy of the performance of our CPD teams, which is, of course, helped by a fantastic comeback of L'Oréal in makeup, continuous performance in hair care.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:07:23
We see, we hope that the market will remain as dynamic in the later part of the year as it was in Q3. Christophe, maybe on selling?
Christophe Babule
CFO
0:07:32
Yes, of course. I want to reinforce the message that the fact the market has been accelerating in Q3, that's a very positive figure, and it is reflected also in our selling. Adjusted off the IT transformation impact, North America has been growing at an adjusted rate of 3.8% and lifting, therefore, the total growth at the end of September at 3.1%. I think when we look at the sell-out, L'Oréal is overperforming the market. The only discrepancy is on LDB, where we still have the problem of inventories compared to last year, but besides, on all other divisions, we see the sales improving.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:08:20
Now, if we go to North Asia, you're right to say that it's a mix of different situations. Let's start with what's, I would say, going in the right direction, which is mainland China. The market is now, year to date, at plus 1%, so it has continued to slightly improve. It was flattish in the first half. Our estimation of the Q3 was around plus 3%. I'm always very careful about China because one quarter doesn't make a trend, but overall, the market has gone into positive territory. It's been boosted by, of all our channels, the one that has improved the most in Q3 is luxury, which has allowed us, and which we have outperformed, which has allowed us to improve our performance versus the market, the Chinese, the mainland China market. Overall, China has stabilized. We see a slight uptick in consumer confidence.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:09:31
We see a stock market that has gone back to the 2019 level, which is good for luxury consumers' morale. I wouldn't get overexcited because there are other macro employment statistics that are not as positive. Let's say it's in positive territory. That's true also for other markets, such as Japan, which is benefiting from Chinese stories, from Korea. Overall, that's going in the right direction. What's still not improving is travel retail. It's improving a bit, but it remains in negative territories. Travel retail Asia is negative in single digits, but with, as we commented in our last call, a significant difference between the downtown stores, which are double-digit negative, and the airports, which are doing better. Travel retail is not positive. Hong Kong is in the same bag, but overall, all in all, you saw the results.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:10:38
As we're entering the end of the year, of course, the big question will be, because you were talking about, should we see a repetition of this improvement on Q4? As you know, this is the big moment for Double Eleven, which is the big promotional event in China. It's too soon to say anything, so it will, of course, the performance of Q4 in China will be, of course, very much dependent upon the dynamism of Double Eleven. Too soon to tell. We'll tell you as much as soon as we know. Overall, we are gaining share in China on three divisions out of four, big time in professional dermatology, and we continue to gain despite our high share in luxury. We are below market on CPD, where the competition is fierce. The good news is that the proportion of luxury is increasing, so that's good for us.

Yes. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I have three. The first one, I don't really expect you to answer this question, but I will ask anyway. Could you give us an idea of how the $4 billion tag is split between the acquisition of Creed and the beauty licenses? My second question, still about the strategic deal with Kering, you mentioned that you are creating a 50/50 joint venture. Could you give us more details about the services and products that might result from this? Could you also tell us what know-how and expertise Kering will bring that you do not already have internally? My last question is about the Armani succession. You mentioned being interested only in the beauty business.

Just want to remind one point, which is very important, is that the price of the deal encompasses the totality of the scope and includes 100% of the acquisition of the house of Creed, together with the long-term license or the rights for three emblematic houses. The price, of course, is for the total deal. For the time being, there is no way to disclose what is our own valuation on those different assets. On the joint venture, on well-being, longevity, it's very early days to give you details. It will take the form of a joint venture between Kering and L'Oréal with a clear goal, which is responding to the strong demand for services and experiences linked to well-being, health, and longevity. It's an ambitious project. We'll put joint resources in it.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:14:08
We will bring our expertise of skincare, of longevity, the longevity research that we have. We will also bring what we've learned from our services we offer in the Carita store that we have in Paris. Kering will bring their expertise in experience luxury, their clienteling. They are used to focus on high-net-worth individuals, which are the primary targets of this type of business. I think it will be a great collaboration. It's a bit too soon to tell, to be honest, but we are both very excited about it because it's one of the megatrends of the moment. I think you will not have missed it. More in the weeks and months to come, but that's how we see it. We're really excited about it.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:15:13
As far as the Armani brand or company, Armani Spice, concerned, I will repeat what we have said, is that, first of all, and I never want to miss saying it, is that we are all very sad of the passing of Mr. Armani, with whom we've collaborated for 40 years. We are very honored that in his succession and in the instruction that he left with his heir, L'Oréal is considered as a potential acquirer, at least of the first part of the first 15%. We said we would consider all the options. It's a bit too soon. The family is mourning and focusing also on driving this business. The only important thing I can confirm today is that the deal we just did with Kering does not prevent us from considering any of the options that are on the table with Armani. We'll rediscuss it in the future.

Olivier Nicolai

Hi, good afternoon, Nicolas, Christophe, Laurent, Eva. I've got two questions, please. Going back to the deal with Kering, I think you mentioned in the press that you were expecting Creed's sales to potentially triple over time. Could you give us perhaps your initial impression on the brand and where do you see the main source of upside? Just regarding Gucci, I think you mentioned that, I mean, essentially, you said that it's by 2028, I believe. Could you see a scenario where you could get a license before that date? In the meantime, if you can't, what is the risk that the Gucci license, to some extent, could deteriorate between now and 2028?
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:17:17
Okay. As far as Creed is concerned, the house of Creed, it's a beautiful brand. It's the number three brand in the top three of the niche fragrances markets, which happens to be the fastest growing part of the fragrance market itself. The niche, which are products that are more valorized, around €200 and more, has been outpacing the overall fragrance market. It happens to be a segment where we are just represented by the collection inside our couture brand. We are underrepresented and undershared. For us, it's already a strong step in this market. We think we plan to accelerate both because we think this part of the market is going to continue to grow fast. I just come back.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:18:22
For the last couple of weeks, I was on a trip in Saudi, which is a fast-rising market, which, like the rest of the Gulf, has an absolute love for fragrances, and not just for blockbusters, but really for expensive niche fragrances that they layer. We see the same in other emerging markets. Of course, we see this in the rest of the Western world. We think that there is going to be organic growth from the segment, but also that we will bring our expertise. We have, I think, proven that we had the capacity with our olfactive department to create one after the other great juices, great fragrances.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:19:05
By the way, even though it's not the question you asked me, I'm happy to report that both Prada Paradoxe and Miu Miu Mutiny are off to a very good start, both entering the top 10 in the market where they have been launched. We think we can bring our knowledge in fragrances and also our clout because with the number of brands that we have in beauty and in luxury beauty in particular, when we are negotiating with retailers, with space, etc., we can probably have some leverage as it relates to Creed. Very, very excited about it and looking forward to working with the teams that have already built such a great success story. As far as the Gucci license, it belongs to Kering to comment on that. I never mentioned the timeline, but it seems that the market had a pretty clear view on it.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:20:11
We are not privy of their discussions, and it wouldn't be appropriate for me to discuss neither with Scotty nor about the details of this part. We'll see. For us, we are patient and we wait. As far as your question on deterioration, we've had experiences in the past of taking over licenses from other big groups. In the end, it has always gone well. These brands are brands that have passed the test of time. I don't think a couple of years can make a huge difference.

Nicolas Hieronimus

Ashley Wallace

0:21:12
Okay. My first question is on 2026. Last year, at the Q3 results, you very helpfully gave us some market growth expectations for 2025. I was wondering if you'd be willing to share your market view on 2026 already, and do you think next year, L'Oréal can see stronger organic revenue growth than in 2025? If so, what are the drivers of that acceleration, maybe from a regional perspective? Then my second question was a follow-up, actually, on the U.S. I think Christophe mentioned that excluding IT phasing, your sell-in was up 3.8%. If I'm not mistaken, you said you estimated the U.S. market growth was at 3.9% for the quarter. Maybe you can help give us a sense of your sell-out trends in Q3, because it sounds like sell-in was below sell-out. Therefore, maybe we can also expect some type of restocking in Q4.
Ashley Wallace
Analyst
0:22:03
What do you think about this? My last question is on fragrances. I think there's some debate now in the market that the fragrance cycle is slowing. Do you see any signs of this? It sounds like it's not impacted the launches for Prada or Miu Miu Mutiny, but what about the other parts of your fragrance business? Can you just remind us if the sell-in for Prada Paradoxe and Miu Miu Mutiny was in Q2 or Q3, or maybe across both quarters?
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:22:27
It was in Q3.
Ashley Wallace
Analyst
0:22:28
Thank you.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:22:29
The selling for Prada and Miu Miu Mutiny was in Q3. By the way, our growth on fragrances year-to-date is just shy of +10%, and we are gaining share. Overall, our fragrances, you know, there are always some brands that, depending on their comparatives, have highs and lows, but our fragrances are doing great. We have multiple brands in the top 10 in both male and female. Libre is number two female fragrance in the world. We've launched, as you said, Prada Paradoxe. We've just launched also a new Ralph Lauren fragrance, Ralph, with Usher as a spokesperson. Overall, our fragrance business is doing good, and the niche fragrance business is also continuing on the market to grow. Yes, the market has slowed a bit, but the fragrance market remains the fastest growing category of beauty.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:23:34
I think today we are probably slightly above mid-single digit for the market, which is twice the speed of the beauty market overall. We remain very confident in fragrance, and we see it continuing to grow with several factors, as we commented. Of course, you know the growth rate is slowing down a bit, but there are still more people using fragrances, more young people having this, what I would call the wardrobe strategy in fragrances, i.e., having several fragrances depending on occasions. By the way, what's interesting is that men in fragrances are right now going faster than female, which reflects the entry in the market of multiple young men and boys that are very excited about, you know, including Paradoxe from Prada. Overall, you know, I remain confident in fragrance. I would say something on that.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:24:40
One of the consumer trends that we see everywhere next to the medical safety trend is this indulgence, feel-good. I mean, we all see the world we live in, and people want things that make them want the bliss of something that smells good. Overall, I remain confident on fragrances. I think your first question was on the U.S. Our sell-out in Q3 was shy of +6%, so above the market. We have, of course, you heard the comparison of the IT system last year. Most of our divisions are in terms of inventory, with absolutely zero issue. We have, as always, a little bit of pipe of the holiday sets from L'Oréal Lux, but like last year. Everything would depend on the success of the holiday season. As fragrances are overrepresented in this holiday season, I think we are confident for the rest of the year.

Ashley Wallace

Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:26:23
No, frankly, I don't know. What I know, when I compare to other industries, I've looked at the list of consumer goods and other industries, and I don't see many industries that grow above +3%, which tends to confirm that the beauty exception continues, whether I don't know if we should call it the lipstick effect or the smell good fragrance effect. I think that the market has accelerated slightly in Q3, and hopefully, it will continue to go in the same direction for next year. Frankly, with the world we're in right now, I'll refrain from prognostics, if you allow me.

Celine Pannuti

0:27:19
Thank you very much. Sorry, I was late joining. Just following back on the discussion just now about market growth, did you mention what market growth was in Q3, and are you still expecting? I think you were expecting about mid-single digit in the second half. Do you think that's happening? Can you talk about, it seems that China is slightly improving, but can you talk about what's going on in Latin America, Europe, from a market standpoint, and whether you think that mid-single digit is where the market can be at some point? The second question is on Europe. We have seen an acceleration. We are hearing nonetheless that the consumers are a bit more under pressure in that region. Can you talk about what drove that performance and what to expect from this market going forward?
Celine Pannuti

0:28:22
Maybe one last question on quite a big change in your Executive Board was announced a few weeks ago. If you can give us a bit of the rationale behind those changes. Thank you.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:28:35
Okay. I'll start with market growth. We consider that because every time we talk about the market, we don't have the full data. We'll go back to the first part of the year, tell you what's our assessment of Q3 and how we see the year. Overall, we see that in Q1, the market was slightly above +2%. It was just slightly below +3% in the first half, which meant Q2 around 3% and 4%, somewhere like this. Our best estimate at this stage for Q3 is that the market growth was pretty similar to that of Q2, maybe a touch better than Q2 because, as you said, the Chinese market was a bit better. The U.S. was a bit better. Latin America was a bit softer, but still in the +8%. It's a good market growth, but it was softer than the first part of the year.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:29:38
Europe was pretty stable with a robust around +4%. It means that our assessment is that the market at the end of nine months is slightly above +3%. For the full year, 2025, our estimation is that it will be close enough to the +4% I was mentioning. Of course, you know it's, as I say, it's money time at the end of the year between Chinese Double Eleven and holiday season in America and Europe. Fingers crossed, and we have lots of ammunitions to drive that market because it's an offer market. That's my first take on the market. Yeah?
Celine Pannuti
Analyst
0:30:28
Can I just get in there? Did you say that time was plus eight, and then can you just explain why you had a much weaker performance in the quarter then?
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:30:42
I just swiped the plus 8 on Latin America. The market was around plus 8. We've had a pretty good performance overall in Latin America. The market was at plus 9 in the first half, plus 8 in the second. In sell-outs, year-to-date, we are above the market, plus 10 on the market at plus 8. We are not underperforming. We never look at the quarter over a quarter because there are some fluctuations of invoicing. Three divisions are outperforming: PPD, Lux, and CPD, big time with hair care. We were slightly below on LDB. Selling should be viewed on a nine-month rather than quarterly basis because there, again, are several IT-related factors that are distorting the quarterly rate. We are very happy with overall our Latin American situation. The market is a tiny bit slower, but as I said, plus 8 is a pretty, pretty decent growth number.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:31:52
Lots of positive things overall in Latin America. Now on Europe, I think the good performance came from market share gains. We've been gaining market share in, if I look at nine months, we are gaining share in three divisions out of four, as in the total group. The gaining is strongly on PPD, on luxury, and at market level on dermatology, and slightly below on mass. Again, increasing and improving, as we do in America, with a strong comeback in makeup, with many initiatives doing a bit better. That's the situation in Europe. I think overall what you have to understand, because it's a bit the same situation in most regions, we really see the acceleration of our new product. We talked about the Beauty Stimulus Plan. It gave us an extra 150 basis points of growth, approximately. We have most initiatives are doing great.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:33:10
It's very, very true in makeup on all divisions. It's very true in hair care. We have many initiatives coming in skincare, and that's going to be helping in China with Helena Rubinstein and Lancome. As I said, fragrances are doing good. The launches are working. As it's an offer market, that's what makes us confident. Your third question, Celine, was?
Celine Pannuti
Analyst
0:33:35
Your executive board.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:33:37
The changes in the Executive Committee. You know, as always, we at L'Oréal try to give our talents and our leaders opportunities to continue to prove themselves and to bring a fresh view on the different regions. We also had the desire, considering the importance of the North American market and the need to have a very strong relationship with the authorities, with the regulators that are current, the CEO, the great David Greenberg, who's one of our strong American talents, to become Chairman because I want him, and I'm going to be, by the way, with him in Washington to have him focus and dedicate his time to this part of both L'Oréal reputation, but also all the work we do on regulation.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:34:38
That has given me the opportunity to appoint Alexis Perakis-Valat, who's done a phenomenal job on CPD, and with a strong comeback, particularly in the North American business in the third quarter, to take America. Then, a chain reaction, Fabrice Megarban, who was in charge of both transformation and our Chief Growth Office, is going to take the Mass Division. He is going to be replaced by Vianney Derville, who's in charge in Europe. Again, a fantastic track record, great contributor of the last couple of years, and pointing to replace Fabrice, to replace, sorry, Vianney in Europe, Emmanuel Goula, who was in charge of travel retail in Praia Suda. He was CEO of L'Oréal Italy.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:35:30
That gave me the opportunity to bring in the COMEX, our first Chinese woman, Eva Yu, who is going to be taking over travel retail, where she had been for a while, the head of travel retail Asia. It's the typical L'Oréal talent development, bringing fresh blood, fresh idea, and fresh vision on every part of the business and continuing to grow people. This is all going to be implemented on 1st of January. They're all in handover right now. I'm pretty sure this is going to be another source of acceleration in the months and years to come.

Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Two for me, please. The first one, could you talk about the level of impact of the Beauty Stimulus Plan in Q3 compared to your previous guidance that the impact will be about 300 basis points versus last year in the second half? Is it there yet? To follow up on that, I appreciate it's too early to talk about market growth next year, but I'll try another way. Any color you can give us on the intensity of launch or Beauty Stimulus Plan heading into next year and any category that you will be focusing? Thank you.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:37:03
As I said, on next year, I'm not going to give you guidance. We've seen a progressive acceleration of the market between the first and second half. We'll see how things evolve next year. What I can see, let's go back to the facts because the facts are the following. U.S. market is getting better. Sapmina, emerging in general, remains dynamic with a slight slowdown, but to a good level of Latin America, consistent growth in double digits of Sapmina. Europe is quite stable. We see China has improved a bit in Q3, as I said. I'm cautious about China because it's hard to know what the next event will truly represent. Overall, you have better America, at least at the same level, if not a better China, stable Europe, and somehow a little bit of reduction of Latin America.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:38:16
It means that the market next year should be a bit better than this year. I'm being very cautious. As far as the Beauty Stimulus Plan, it added 170 basis points in Q3. We'll see what happens in Q4 because this is where the weight of fragrances will increase. We have still a few ammunitions, if I may use that term, that were not launched in Q3 that were, in the end, when I look at Q3, you had the things that were launched in the first part of the year, the new fragrances. We still have a few launches in skincare in Paris, a few makeup initiatives. Hopefully, it will increase even more in Q4. It's not an exact science, but what I know is that it's above last year by, yeah, 170 basis points.

Yes, hi. Just one question. Obviously, this year was all about more innovation to kind of stimulate the market. How should we think about that in the context of next year? I'm not talking about the market. I'm thinking about whether you see the potential to maintain that level of innovation next year, or can you even do better? Thanks.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:39:51
I think the answer is very clear. Yes, we want and will maintain this level of innovation. It's clear that when the context is a bit less rosy, as is the world today, beauty has to play its role of bringing a smile on people's face. We have to do our job in tempting consumers with exciting stuff. We hadn't been doing it enough the prior year because probably there were tailwinds that were carrying the market. Now we have to carry the market, and we do it. We do it both through the launches that are being launched now, and that will, most of them being successful, carry over for next year. Of course, that's what I spend my days right now in the meetings, is reviewing the plans. We have strong plans for 2026. We want to keep that pace very clearly.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:40:52
There is something that we haven't discussed so much in the questions we've had, and which plays also a role in our capacity to overperform the market, which is the role of digital and e-commerce. You know, when we say the market is growing a bit above plus 3%, probably the growth rate of e-commerce is more than twice that. We grow our e-commerce growth at plus 12% right now. We are really doubling down on that because it allows us to reach new consumers, whether in India and Saudi, in the U.S., or in China, where it's the largest part of our business. E-commerce also allows us to penetrate much faster with new products or continuing to animate existing brands.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:41:42
I think in the current context where in the beauty world, offline or brick and mortar is a bit more stable and where e-commerce is more booming, that helps us overperform. That's what we intend to continue to do too.

Hey, just a point of clarification. I think you said on North America that sell-out was 6%. Adjusted sell-in was 3.8%. I think you also sort of suggested there aren't really any inventory issues. I was just sort of trying to square that circle, if you like. If you could elaborate, that'd be brilliant. Thank you.

Jeff Stent

Because I think we have heard the acceleration of makeup that plays a role in our own acceleration. There are category mixes that play, but maybe, Christophe, you want to.
Jeff Stent
Analyst
0:43:03
Yes, I just want, again, to restate exactly the growth. North America in Q3, adjusted, is 3.8%. Therefore, cumulated adjusted is 3.1%. We had a very strong Q3 in North America. This has to be compared, of course, with the situation of the market, reminding two key important factors. First is the fact that we have a business in North America that is heavyweighted on makeup. As you know, makeup is not the most dynamic category right now, even if it's recovering. Also, there is a part of the market where we are not there. Here, I refer to the mass fragrances and hygiene, where it accounts for only 2% of our sales in the U.S., while the market is 14%. What is important is to see really how our divisions are competing in their own territory.
Jeff Stent
Analyst
0:43:55
That's an area where we are very proud because, in fact, we are still gaining market share and recovering. That's why overall the situation of our business in the U.S. is nearly on par with the market, despite those unfavorable factors, footprints.

Thank you. Good evening all. Just sort of three clarification questions, I guess, on my part. Just to come back to Latam, you're talking about the sell-out at 10%, but I think Latam 4.4% organic sales growth with no adjustments involved there. Just trying to understand, is that a disconnect in terms of shipments that we might catch up in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to understand the fourth quarter dynamics. Going back again to the U.S., sorry, just on the U.S. dynamics, you're doing 3.8%, as you say, underlying. I think you said the market did 3.9%. Normally, you're well ahead of the market. I guess what you just said is that you're in line with the market despite the weightings of your business. Just again to understand, was there some deficit in terms of your shipments versus the sell-out in the U.S., or is that aligned?
David Hayes
Analyst
0:45:19
The last question was, is the 1.5 percentage points you mentioned of innovation impact in the quarter, is that at the group level? Is that the right interpretation? Is that something that goes up next quarter, or is that the biggest benefit in the third quarter, or is that something that could contribute even more as you roll those new renovations into next quarter? Thank you.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:45:41
We'll see. In theory, it should go up a bit in the next quarter. It should go up in the next quarter because you have a bigger weight of the categories that are where we have had our biggest innovation, and particularly fragrances that are where we are very strong. As far as the U.S., we were below market on CPD, which weighs a lot. We have accelerated on CPD very significantly over the summer, particularly July, August, and September, thanks to great performance, as I said, on hair care and a great comeback on makeup with both L'Oréal Paris and NYX in particular, significantly outperforming the market. I have to say that you're trying to get the number of recalculations, which I have a hard time now following. I think the message that you have to remember is that the U.S.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:46:46
market is improving, and we are improving faster than the U.S. market. That's, I think, my best shot at your question. You want to say a word on Latin America, Christophe, or you want me to take it? On Latin America, we look at the performance on a nine-months basis, and we're indeed roughly at plus 10% in sell-out, and the market's at plus 8%.

Hi, good evening. Actually, my question has already been answered, but I also have some follow-up questions for Nicolas after this very interesting interview you gave with Luca De Meo in Le Figaro. The first one is on Yves Saint Laurent Beauté. Can you confirm the brand is generating today more than €2 billion in consolidated sales, not at retail value? The second one on Gucci. In the interview, you gave quite bullish comments on the long-term potential of the license. Do you think Gucci Beauty could become, in the long term, your biggest couture brand? I mean, bigger than Yves Saint Laurent Beauté?
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:48:09
First of all, I can confirm that Yves Saint Laurent is bigger in net sales than €2 billion. It's actually not far from €3 billion. It's one of the successes we are the most proud of. It entered the top five worldwide of luxury beauty, with great successes in fragrances, but also particularly in makeup. As far as Gucci, I don't have the exact numbers and data of their sales, but we know it's significantly smaller. As a fashion brand, Gucci is bigger than Yves Saint Laurent. In the long term, over the 50 years we are talking about, which is the term of the licenses that we will get when available, I think there is indeed the potential for Gucci to become, I don't know how long it would take, but it can catch up Yves Saint Laurent, yeah.

It'd be helpful to maybe know how the market is performing today versus how L'Oréal is performing. If you could split that out, how CeraVe and La Roche-Posay are holding up. Secondly, just a quick one, in light of the Kering Beauty deal, does this change your thought process regarding the Galderma stake at all? Thank you.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO

Okay. On LDB, the first thing to say is that it's the one division where there is still a significant discrepancy between our selling, our invoicing, which is a bit less than 4, and our sell-out, which is around 7. The big difference comes from Europe, where we're still offsetting the inventory of the sun care season last year. It's more important to look at sell-out to give you a good perspective. I'll tell you about the brands, as you mentioned. The market in dermo has been slowing. It's globally at +5% at the end of after nine months. It's mostly the North American market that has slowed down with weakness in drug stores and probably a bit cautious consumption on this category of products. L'Oréal is well above that market, and we grow at 1.5 times the market, especially in North Asia.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:51:16
In North America, we are growing at three times the market. We continue to be healthy in sell-out on the market that's a bit slower. In terms of brands, the strongest momentum right now is in brands that are related to aesthetics. I'm thinking about SkinCeuticals, which has a double-digit growth. It's true, it's very strong in the U.S. as it is in China. Hair care is very strong also, both with Dercos and CeraVe. La Roche-Posay is the hair series. CeraVe, which has gone back into positive territory in the U.S., which was very important to me, particularly in moisturizers. I think we are now on the upward trend on CeraVe. We have a number of initiatives coming. On La Roche-Posay, we're launching a new relaunch of Yalu B5, which is one of our best sellers in anti-aging, both with a serum and a cream.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:52:14
We have new intense moisturizers coming on CeraVe. We have acne patches coming on CeraVe. We continue to believe very strongly in the power of dermatological beauty and of brands that are correlated to the world of aesthetics, such as SkinCeuticals, which leads me to a perfect segue to the question you asked me on Galderma. Right now, nothing's changed. The fact that we did this great partnership and deal with Kering doesn't change the situation on Galderma. There's nothing new. We are still in our observation process. Nothing more to say on that topic.

Thank you very much. I want to build on one of your prior comments about the importance of e-commerce to your business and the beauty business. Perhaps just narrowing things down on the U.S., Amazon has become an important channel now. You've done a terrific job with Lancôme there, I think, as the pioneer on prestige beauty. I was wondering if you can talk about the impact you see of Amazon's success on the growth of the beauty market in general, channel dynamics, and your strategy. Thank you.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:54:08
I must say that indeed, first of all, we are very happy with our performance in e-commerce in general. As I said, we're growing double digit. It's around getting closer to 30% of our sales. I think it's 28% as we speak today. Our e-commerce strategy relies on multiple partners from pure players such as Amazon, OT Mall in China, or JD, Social Commerce, and of course, the e-commerce platforms of our brick and mortar partners, be it Sephora, Walmart, in the U.S. I must say that overall, we are very happy of the situation with Amazon because it allows our brands to reach a larger number of consumers.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:55:07
You know we were talking about the U.S., but 10 days ago, I was in India, where it's clearly a game changer for us because whether it's quick commerce or the traditional platform allows us to reach consumers all over the country, which we couldn't do before. Going back to Amazon, it's a very strong partnership. It's recruiting new consumers to the brand. It's also loyalizing some consumers that have discovered some of our brands in other channels. It's a very, very dynamic momentum. I think it is indeed contributing to the growth of the market. We saw at the beginning of the year in the U.S. where there was a little bit of loss of traffic in the brick and mortar world in North America. E-commerce in general, and Amazon in particular, were remaining pretty dynamic.
Nicolas Hieronimus
CEO
0:56:03
Beauty is a category where you need the brick and mortar experience to smell, to touch the textures, to discover the brand, and have the full experience. It's also a category where when you fall in love with a given product, whether it's a new mascara, whether it's a fragrance you love, the capacity to replenish and sometimes even to discover for categories that are a bit less sensorial, there's a perfect complementarity. I really believe in what we call O+O, online plus offline strategy. That's how we grow our brands, making sure, of course, that their equity is absolutely well served and protected in every channel we operate in. I hope that answers your question.

Good afternoon and welcome to all of you present in big numbers here in the room. Welcome to all the followers who are with us for the third time this year for this conference. I will begin, and then I will turn over to my colleagues whom you all know, I'm sure. Eventually, we will turn over to you and your questions. The agenda for this afternoon is as follows. It is quite standard, so I will not go through the agenda. Let me move on to the highlights. I will start in an unusual fashion. We usually focus on the profits, on the P&L, but now I will start with volumes. As you may recall, we said that we would start growing with loans, which has not always happened, but this is our commitment. Last quarter shows that we actually go full steam ahead.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:01:11
All the volumes in all the segments have grown by 2.4% across the bank. We will see the breakdown by business line. The growth is interesting and optimistic, we think. We are now enjoying tailwinds. We will see what happens next, but I am smiling not without prejudice. Looking at the P&L, my smile will be less wide. The profits we made have been stable, but below the previous quarters. The profit was affected by weak fees and commissions in the quarter. More on that later. When it comes to net interest income, NII, we reported a modest drop, but it would not have been otherwise due to the low interest rate environment. Our return on equity net is above 18%, including all relevant factors, including CHF loan provisions. The cost-income ratio has remained stable. What is important is that our loan volumes have grown across all segments. We are.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:02:44
Going in full swing with mortgage loans. We were hardly active in this market before due to political and legal risks, which have fortunately not materialized. We are now very active in this market. My final comment on this slide, something we will definitely come back to later. This is our last—let me put it differently—or maybe not. This is our last conference before we publish our new strategy for 2026-2030. It will be presented on the 11th of December. You are all welcome to take part in this very important event, important to the bank and to the market, I believe. Now, an overview of our pillars. The share of sustainable funding has grown. We are above our current strategic target under the Go Mobile strategy, even though.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:03:58
Winds keep turning in ESG-related matters. We believe it is our responsibility as a major bank to support the energy transition in Poland and to assist our customers in trying to reduce their carbon intensity. In the up pillar, let me share something I like very much personally, the pupil card for pet owners, which is a product aligned with our values while being attractive to our clients. It has caused a lot of positive reaction in the market and created a good atmosphere around the bank. I do not want you to think I am pursuing my own personal interests, but I love dogs. I have three dogs plus other smaller pets at home, including bowlfish. Now, regarding the stronger pillar, one thing we are particularly proud of, our 2024 annual report has been awarded as the best of the best.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:05:11
You cannot get any better, although I will insist that my colleague, VP Konieczny, goes even higher, but he may actually crash against the glass ceiling. What I'm saying is that we are trying to communicate with you, the market, in a clear, transparent manner, sharing top-quality materials. Moving on, let's have a look at the representation of our volumes in figures. I've mentioned mortgages. Significant growth there, gigantic year on year, and very solid quarter on quarter. We remain very active in this market. Our machinery is now well-oiled and working in full swing, so I'm very optimistic about this asset class. Another point I'd like to mention is the continued growth in our offering of investment products and a significant year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increase. Regarding customers, in corporate banking, the chart may not be very clear, but the number of corporate clients increased. The number of.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:06:34
SME customers dropped modestly, but the portfolio mix is better quality than ever before. Now, let's have a look at loans. 2.4% growth quarter on quarter, as I mentioned. Regarding retail customers, let me remind you, we've had a number of quarters where the volume of retail loans decreased because new production could not catch up with repayments. Now, we have more than a 3% growth quarter on quarter and a significant, decent growth in institutional customer loans. Minor growth in deposits, as I've been saying on many previous occasions, and I will repeat once again, we are not in a race to get more deposits than others. We want our deposits to be well-placed, and we want this business to contribute in a good way to our profit and loss account. Looking at the number of customers, one important point, I think.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:07:45
As I've mentioned in previous meetings, this year we've been focusing on cleaning up the customer database in retail. This process continues and will go into Q4, but we plan to complete it later this year by having removed those records in our systems that are no longer active. Where any attempts we've made to activate them have failed, we will instead focus on customers who are active as well as new customers we are planning to acquire. As I mentioned, the growth in the number of institutional customers, both included the corporate and micro sub-segments. Our net banking income, as you saw in the first slide, dropped year on year and dropped quarter on quarter. This is because of the fees and commissions. More on that later. The cost of risk increased quarter on quarter, but remained low, and the quality of the portfolio remains strong.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:09:03
We are not expecting any negative change. The net profit, just under PLN 700 million. Smaller than in Q2, much smaller than in Q3 2024. Due to our cost discipline, the operating expenses increased much less than reported by many other banks who have reported Q3 figures. Less than 2% quarter on quarter, even less year on year, which shows that our cost management system is efficient and that the cost discipline remains in place in the bank, that our internal processes help us to effectively avoid redundant spending. Other than critical expenses, we're looking for savings. We're looking to optimize, and this will never change. This is our culture as a bank. Cost management is our top priority, and we are working hard to improve our efficiency steadily, as we will discuss when we present our new strategy.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:10:25
I've mentioned the cost-income ratio, a small drop in the net interest margin due to the lower rates, cost of risk after nine months, 16 basis points, despite a much higher cost in Q3. This will be definitely discussed by my colleague later on, but a major part of this growth in Q3 was due to a single major exposure to a client. As you will know from media reports, ROE above 18%. Let me go back now to fees and commissions. As you will see, the NFC dropped. That's, first of all, due to the fact that there were no major one-offs in Q3, which we typically report during the year. We are looking into this track record. We will definitely be working very hard to make sure that Q3 was one-off in terms of the NFC being so weak on our P&L. I'm not expecting.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:11:36
Any negative trajectory in the upcoming periods in this regard. Let me hand over to Mr. Dybula, who will discuss the world. Państwu.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:11:46
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The available data indicates that the third quarter was good for our economy. GDP growth has remained at the level of 3.5% year on year. One thing that has not changed, definitely, are the main growth drivers. It is still the domestic demand, both consumer spending and investment spending. What is important, probably from the perspective of the future and the economic outlook in Poland, is that both consumption and investments seem to become more stable. Consumption is increasingly driven by spending on durable goods. This is important because if this spending is increasing, such growth usually does not end after one or two quarters. The case is similar for investments in the enterprise sector.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:13:07
We see rather clear growth of outlays on property, plant, and equipment. This is also a reason for optimism in the coming quarters with regard to the economic growth trajectory. One unknown and a factor of concern is still our external environment. The import from EU countries will bear heavy customs fees due to changed US policy. It is clear that the exports to US markets have suffered in the recent months. All that, however, is still compensated by selling foreign goods to European markets and other large economies. Inflation should not hamper the successful development growth in the future. There is no inflationary pressure at this time. This is due to externalities. The raw materials are relatively cheap or getting cheaper. The dollar is weaker, or the zloty is strong. This mitigates the pressure from imported inflation.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:14:38
The situation is the same in the case of the domestic factor. We can see a clear slowdown of the growth dynamic of wages. This has a positive influence on results. When inflation is lower, interest rates are lower in the third and the fourth quarter. The central bank has continued relaxing monetary policy. I do believe that yesterday's announcement is not the end yet. Although I do not believe we should expect that at every meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, we will see a decrease in interest rates. The process will probably be more contingent on incoming data. However, I do believe it is not the end yet. We are not yet at the target level of interest rates. Good business dynamics, low interest rates. This is a good time to take a loan. And indeed.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:15:50
Loans are growing, both in terms of new sales and new volume, and it is growing quite fast. I do believe that in the next months or quarters, this is not going to change in any significant way. As for deposits, we still have a surplus, or the growth dynamics of deposits in the non-financial sector is still faster than the growth rate of loans, but we all know it is related to the fact that we have a strong influx of funds from abroad. The second thing, the budgetary deficit, high budgetary deficit, is financed by national banks. This has an impact on growth of deposits as well, and it is not going to change in the coming quarters. Thank you very much, and now I turn over to the other colleague.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:16:52
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, we've already experienced nine months of this year.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:17:08
Only the last quarter is still ahead of us. As we look at it, we have over PLN 2 billion of net profit for 2025. It is built on robust income from all usual sources, I mean usual for a universal bank. It is supported by a disciplined cost management policy, where year on year, we only noted a very small increase. This puts us way ahead of our players in the market. During those nine months, we have also noted a significant decrease in dynamics of new Swiss franc cases and new litigations. This allows us to create provisions for those cases with less intensity, which does have also an impact on the net result of our bank this year. On the balance sheet side, you can see a rebound, like my colleagues said, with regard to loan activity.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:18:24
We see an increased scale of lending, and despite the fact that the bank, as was mentioned before, does not conduct very aggressive policy. For receiving client funds, nonetheless, the funds are coming in. Since we offer products for all segments of the market, deposit balances at our bank are increasing as well. They have also increased materially year on year. As for indicators, KPIs, the bank, of course, meets all the standards. After nine months, we have a bit over 18% of return on equity with an interest margin of 3.43. If we focus on the loan portfolio, one important thing that I would like you to remember is that our bank is back on the growth path in practically all the market segments, both in retail banking, based on robust increase in property financing, real estate financing. Also in the area of corporate banking, enterprise banking.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:19:48
One thing that makes us very happy is that we see growth, like Michal said, both in working capital financing and investment financing. That is always contributing to the stability of the book of loans. As for Swiss francs, if we compare the dynamics of cases in flow and the models that we apply for recognizing trends and creating provisions, you can see that year on year, we have 47% less inflow. This is a very material change. This also helps us to be quite optimistic about the future in terms of provisions in the future periods. We have continued our activity in terms of individual amicable settlements with our clients. As of the end of September, we had over 6,500 such settlements accepted. As for the deposit position of the bank, on one hand, the bank is very careful, very prudent in terms of pricing.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:21:17
We try to diversify our sources of financing in terms of product segments and prices, while at the same time offering to the clients the opportunity to get better yields by using investment funds. With regard to which we also noted a significant growth. Speaking of investment funds, it is pretty much a stable, permanent growth story. We see growing interest among our clients. On one hand, it is related to seeking more attractive opportunities to invest any financial surplus in the environment of declining interest rates, in expectation of this trend to continue. Our clients prefer debt instrument funds, short and mid-term funds on that market. I am sure we would love to continue with the kind of dynamic that we've had so far. Going back to performance, the largest part income from interest, net interest income. We see that despite the going back to.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:22:46
Growing lending activity, we still see. A pressure. Towards the net interest income coming from declining interest rates. To a large extent, we are able to compensate it by. Income from interest in. Hedge accounting. As well as. The policy. For. Obtaining. Varied sources of financing and looking after margins in that area. We can see a slight declining trend in terms of net interest income. This is because we are at the interest rate decline part of the cycle. Looking forward. And looking at our sensitivity to interest rate changes. We continue to anticipate that the. Interest rates would continue to decline, and our sensitivity is approximately 100 basis points. This is about PLN 180 million. As far as. Income from interest is concerned, we are still rebuilding. Reconstructing that. Stream. Of revenues in the bank and adapting it to the new level of interest rates.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:24:15
As for fees and commissions, this was not our best quarter with regard to income from fees and commissions. As we analyze the dynamics and the impact of individual constituent parts, we do believe that the main source for that, or the main reason for that situation, was the success of previous quarters. In the previous quarters, the banking activity, especially corporate banking in the large enterprises sector, we had a number of large transactions that were, if I may say so, very calorie high in terms of volume. If such large transactions did not occur in the third quarter, the quarterly dynamic, of course, shows a noticeable decline. As for card operations, it is card transactions. In our bank, this position is also sensitive to clearing streams with Visa and MasterCard. These have different.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:25:34
Structures in different quarters, and this has overlaid the dynamics that we have noted in the third quarter. As for commercial and investment activity, we have very good dynamics year to year. Also in quarter to quarter. A very similar situation as in revenues from fees and commissions. No recurring major transactions in the third quarter, major volatility of the currency market. For obvious reasons, the clients were less willing to hedge with interest rates in an environment where there is not really much uncertainty with regard to interest rates. Everybody is anticipating they would be declining. For that reason, our quarterly production and this contribution of this source to P&L account was smaller. Nonetheless, please note that year-on-year dynamics is robust, and we still believe that this is a solid contributor to building the bank's profits. As for the costs, we have already mentioned the cost management discipline.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:26:59
We definitely look at every PLN we spend from both sides. It does not mean that our bank has suspended investment activity or made any other dramatic moves. No, we do continue. We actually increase our investment activity in certain areas. Even this year, I am sure that you see more. We are more visible in terms of marketing activity, for example. Where we rationalize more is the area of broadly understood external services, advisory services. Those are being reviewed and verified. The entire cost management discipline is not based on one single title. It encompasses multiple other smaller activities that together have an impact on the bank's costs. LLPs, that is something for Wojciech to discuss, I guess.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:28:09
Good afternoon. Two quarters into the year, our cost of risk in Q3 was very, very limited. Linked only to one of. We set up provisions.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:28:34
Long ago against potential losses on individual clients once the credit holidays are over and they are repaying their loans once again. These provisions have not materialized, and we do not want to keep holding them, so we have released these provisions. On the other hand, we have set up prudent provisions against the photovoltaic farms as a segment. For the time being, this provision has not materialized in any way. It is just out of being prudent that we have set it up. One other event we have mentioned before, one group of companies in the chemical sector with its project. On the one hand, the capital group, our exposure after restructuring is now very, very limited. It is marginal, I should say, but it is fully covered by provisions. With respect to the project, the provisions were set up.
Wojciech Kembłowski

At a level high enough, there is no need to set up any more. We are not anticipating to set up any additional provisions in the future. Regarding the loan portfolio quality, very stable, around 3%. That is the NPL ratio. Less than PLN 2.8 billion and falling. Restructuring continues successfully across all the segments. I should like to say that, as every year, we do restructure the retail portfolio in Q2 and restructure other portfolios in Q4. We will be selling assets. You do not see that yet in the numbers. With stable quality of the portfolio, with good sales, the NPL portfolio will definitely remain stable in terms of a percentage and the volume. The mix of the portfolio and the stages, these are all very stable. Stage one, stage two, stage three have been stable. Also stable across the segments. That is because we set up the provisions.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:31:09
The coverage ratio has thus increased. With sales in the next quarter, the coverage may fall because we are always selling impaired loans with the biggest coverage with provisions. I am expecting continued stability in this regard. Thank you. Now, let's turn to the capital position of the bank. I would like to point out two or three highlights as a result of our efforts to strengthen the portfolio of equity instruments, including tier two. We are working on this portfolio regularly to protect its size and cost levels. Our dividend policy, which we have pursued, where the profits are shared with our investors while also at the same time improving our capital position. With all that, the bank's capital position is robust and complies with all the regulatory requirements. Most importantly, perhaps, it positions the bank to further grow its commercial banking, its lending.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:32:58
We have all the necessary resources to grow and to prepare for absorption of new good business. That is all from me. Thank you.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:33:09
Thank you very much. As usual, the final slide in this presentation. We look forward with optimism because we are optimistic. It looks likely that Poland will continue to grow as an economy. We think in 2025, 2030, the CAGR will be more than 3%. If Poland actually becomes one of the top 20 economies in the world, you can talk about an economic miracle. I think it is thanks to the very hard efforts of all of us: entrepreneurs, managers, employees. Despite headwinds and obstacles, the rates have been falling, and then they will continue to grow. We have to adapt to this environment, and we will. As regards the challenges ahead, what is of special concern is that yet once again we are facing.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:34:20
Political interventions. On the part of the government and hence parliament. I have been vocal about it. I have published on this topic. I've been saying that an increased corporate income tax for a single industry to be maintained higher forever is unfair, inappropriate, most likely also, and this is something the Polish Banks Association have said, unconstitutional. I'm very sorry to say that whoever is in power, they don't understand that Poland needs an efficient, growing, technologically and intellectually advanced banking industry to be protected, definitely not to be interfered with by means of asymmetric interventions. This is a classical example where short-term interests in view of the public deficit are given preference over harmonious development of the Polish economy. I regret that very much. When I look at Q3, and I'm not going back to the fees and commissions now, I'm very happy that.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:35:41
Our volumes have budged and that we are now growing with wins in our sales. What I haven't been quite clear about is that in addition to corporate and micro customers, we can see an increase in the database of our wealthy customers and wealth management and private banking, where relationships with individual customers are very, very close and strong, which is in line with our strategy. I'm happy to say that we come up with avenue ideas to support the acquisition of new clients and that the acquisition with a capital A will continue for many more quarters to come. We want to grow. We want our customers to bank with us through many different segments and products. We believe that NFC will be back on track. With the help of the market, the trading income should also be back on track because it's down across the market.
Przemysław Gdański
CEO
0:36:44
Our market share is very much like 20% of the market. A big market share, but unfavorable, inauspicious market conditions. I'm optimistic about the future, though. Our priorities are acquisition, more active lending, reflecting on volumes, better efficiency, better processes. We are always working to improve our processes. We want our customers to have a smooth, positive, unhindered experience with our bank, something we are working on very hard. Intensity is something we are saying again and again. We will share more details on the 11th of December. You are welcome to attend our event. Now, we are ready to take your questions in the Q&A. Somewhere at the end of this presentation, we have a slide for that, I'm sure. Here we are. Let's open the Q&A officially now. Do we have any questions in the room?

Kamil Stolarski

I must say I'm very happy that the bank is growing again. It's one of the questions I heard a lot as an analyst. Why is BNP not growing? Now you are selling again. Selling mortgages after three years. As Mr. Gdański said, you were not very active. Could you comment why for such a long period of time your bank refrained from selling and now you are very busy? That's my first question. Number two, when you published your last strategy three years ago, your bank was in full swing. Then a few quarters later, the sales were put on hold, in fact. My question is about the strategy. When you publish your new strategy in December, is it important or is it just words on paper? No, no, no, no.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:39:22
Thank you for both your questions. Let me take your first question.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:39:25
First, if you put it to us first, it might be easier to forget as we speak. Now, at some point, we made a decision to sharply reduce the sales of mortgage loans. We said we limit ourselves to selling to our existing customers and selling green mortgages. That was because of the credit holidays and our concerns, unjustified as it were, that any continued assistance to mortgage borrowers, unjustified as it were, would continue. The credit holidays were extended. We were right, although the scale and the size of that program was reduced. I do not know if it is political of me to say so, but we were trying to protest. You cannot do that, we thought. The first credit holiday program was scandalous, was unnecessary, very expensive, very frustrating, unheard of in other European countries. We decided.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:40:41
We do not want to increase the risk of having to face the same story later in the future. We understand that a mortgage loan is a core product for a retail bank. At some point in time, we decided, okay, it seems nothing as painful will happen to us again. Let's go back to that market. Let's oil the machinery. Let's start the production. Our factory is now turning out that product in full swing. We are not going to slow down, I think, even though the risk of interventions going against our sector is still high, as reflected in the higher CIT story. The strategy. We announced our strategy in early 2021. It was developed in late 2020. The war in Ukraine broke out. Am I correct? Are these the correct dates or not? Correct me if I am wrong. Early 2022, that is what I meant.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:41:58
I remember. We had the long debate in the management board whether we should publish our strategy now that the war in Ukraine broke out, or should we correct it? We published the original strategy. We set a number of strategic objectives in the strategy, which we are now either delivering or exceeding. The strategy directed our efforts. It set out directions for our growth over the years. For us, a strategy is a fundamental document, which defines our investment decisions, the targets for the managers and the management board of the bank. It talks about what is really important, the directions we want to go. Clearly, this is also true of the strategy we will publish on December 11th. The fact is the world keeps changing incredibly fast. There are lots of interesting papers deliberating whether midterm strategies make sense anymore.
Wojciech Kembłowski
VP of Management Board
0:43:14
Maybe we should just be focusing on tactical day-to-day management. I think you cannot go in the right direction unless you have a clear direction to go and a clear reading of how much you've covered and where your destination is. This strategy will be very important for us. As you definitely know, we have been working on the strategy together with our Supervisory Board. We hope it will be subject to corporate approvals the day before the publication. It is a serious document that we take very seriously.
Kamil Stolarski
Analyst
0:43:50
Thank you very much. Follow-up question. I have other questions as well. I don't know if I may ask them. Maybe one question regarding this quarter. The fees, commissions, and FX. You are the last bank to report before Handlover, and you have reported that you have less the corporate business that has an impact on lower.
Kamil Stolarski
Analyst
0:44:28
Fees and loan. You said there was a trend to take CIB clients from other banks. Has a client left you and you had to account for it? Or what is happening?
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:44:41
Let us answer collectively. As for FX, the entire market has slumped. I have recently presented a comparative analysis. We do prepare a benchmark analysis looking at not all, but the ones that are particularly relevant to us, the banks that are particularly relevant to us. Except for one that started at a very low base, all of them have noted a slump in FX performance. That is one thing. The other thing is that this year we had a one-off transaction, very high in volume and very complex. It supported our result in this position to the tune of tens of millions.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:45:39
None of our clients left, but our baseline was very, very high. This declined. FX performance stems from absence of one-off, the high volatility, and the fact that the clients are convinced that the only way for interest rates to go is down. Hence, volatility is close to zero. This is the situation. As for fees, I would like to give the floor to Mr. President.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:46:15
In case of fees, as I tried to explain, we are dealing with a very similar phenomenon, the recurrent business. If you look at our quarterly flow, we have a normal quarter without one-offs. Since in the first and second quarter, we had, on one hand, support in card area, Mastercard clearing. We usually clear this kind of support in the first quarter of the year, and that is why the first quarter is always higher.
Piotr Konieczny
VP of Management Board
0:46:54
On the other hand, we had those transactions that Mr. President has mentioned. They do have a fee component or a commission component. Large transactions by large corporations have significantly increased the baseline, especially for the second quarter. In Q3, we did not have such windfalls, such major transactions. We have returned to the standard level.
Kamil Stolarski
Analyst
0:47:25
Thank you very much for your comment. The final question is about the strategy. Since this topic resonates, I would like to ask this question. The BNP is working on strategy as a group, I believe, and some other changes were announced. Probably the BNP is considering its group as a whole. Have you heard any information that BNP Paribas Poland would be considered non-core?
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:47:56
Let me answer this question. We are a little bit out of phase in terms of working on strategy.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:48:04
The strategy for the entire group will be announced at the beginning of 2027. In the meantime, the areas which, either like us, are at the end of their previous strategy or need to change the strategy, are developing their strategies, like Ashmesh in France. We were not given to understand anything like that, like what you suggested. If we look at what the BNP Paribas Group is saying, we are a European leader. We are the largest banking group in the European Union. Poland is the sixth-largest economy in the EU and the fastest-growing market in the EU. It would be difficult to imagine continuing the European strategy and exiting such a significant market. Another element we are not mentioning is that since these are our sister operations, in Poland, we have a number of companies.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:49:17
Belonging to the group, Arval, number one in the market. A factoring company, Cardiff, insurance business. Shared services centers, a number of those. In these areas, new competence centers, IT hubs are being created. The business of a number of those companies is very strongly correlated with the bank. For Cardiff, we are the main distribution channel for the insurance products. We sell to our clients the services of long-term lease provided by Arval. Factoring, this is obvious in a corporate world of SMEs. We have this woven basket of businesses that keeps growing the economy. I am definitely not concerned that we would find ourselves outside of the Paribas Group, within which we are very comfortable. Are there any more questions in the room?
Andrzej Powierża
Analyst
0:50:36
Good afternoon, Andrzej Powierza, Citi Handlowy, Brokerage Office. A detailed question. May I ask you for an estimate?
Andrzej Powierża
Analyst
0:50:50
What percentage of personnel costs are the costs of IT personnel? I esteem you very highly.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:51:00
I'm talking off the top of my head, so the estimate is very, very rough. It is something between 13% and 15%. I don't know what was the background of your question, but we are managing personnel costs very proactively as well, and we intend to continue in this manner.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:51:30
Have we got any questions in the room, or shall we move on to questions online? Let us move on to questions online then. Mr. Tadeuszak, what was the number of disputes in the third quarter with regard to unauthorized transactions? Let me answer this question indirectly. The bank is a party to a procedure with the Office for Competition and Consumers. We are in a dialogue for resolving the unauthorized transactions, both historically and in the future.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:52:13
This year, we have established a total of approximately PLN 49 million worth of provisions. This has not changed. I think I would stop at that. I do believe that the dialogue that ourselves and other banks have with the Office for Competition and Consumer Protection will eventually deliver a solution. Another question, subjectively about finance. Are you expecting a major or even minor war in terms of loan margins at the mortgage market? They are very high despite the demand for loans. Will BNP Paribas enthusiastically offer loans based on floating rate, or will you remain with a fixed rate? Everything we do, we do enthusiastically. Let me start from the end of your question. Nonetheless, we do believe that the loan that is fixed rate or at least periodically fixed rate is something that we should focus on. While.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:53:33
Pollster, which is not easy to pronounce, we will continue to adopt it in line with market trends. Price war on mortgages, I would not expect one. We are talking about creating very long-term assets. The impact of a margin over such a long term is very important. I assume that the market will behave rationally. The demand is high, the supply is high as well. I do believe that the market will develop a balance that will be acceptable, both for our dear borrowers and reasonable for lenders. A question from Trigon. Is the bank planning any legal action with regard to unconstitutionality of CIT increase together or with Banks Association? The bank has spoken out on it via various publications and speeches. We talked about how unfair it was to increase the CIT for banking sector only.
Michał Dybuła
Chief Economist
0:54:50
We suggested that in other countries, a different type of solidarity solution was implemented. This remained without reactions. The Polish Banks Association, of which we, of course, are a member, is very active in this area. As for legal matters and unconstitutionality, we do not consider individual action on this matter. We assume that potentially such actions will be undertaken on behalf of the sector by the Polish Banks Association. Thank you very much. Those are all the questions. If there are no more questions, thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for coming here in numbers. Thank you to all those who found the time to join us over the internet. Once again, let me invite you to join us on December 11th. Have a good rest of the day and good rest of the quarter. Thank you for your attention."

Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining AXA's Nine Months 2025 Activity Indicators Call. Our Group CFO, Alban de Mailly Nesle, will walk through the highlights from the press release that we published last night, after which we'll be ready to take your questions. With that, I turn it over to Alban.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:00:53
Thank you, Anu, and good morning to all of you. Thank you for joining the call today. Let me start with the key highlights. On Nine Months 2025, overall, we delivered a solid performance, with total revenues increasing by 7% to €89 billion. This reflects the strength of our franchise, which, as you know, is well-diversified by line of business, with 60% in P&C and 40% in Life and Health. It is also balanced between B2B and B2C. All our geographies are delivering a consistent execution of our organic growth strategy, which is one of the key levers of our current plan. We continue to operate at a high level of capital, with a solvency ratio at 222%. In the quarter, the Group's financial strength was further affirmed by the decision from Moody’s to upgrade its rating from AA3 to AA2.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:01:58
Let me now go through the key numbers of the release, and I start with P&C. P&C revenues were up 5% to €46 billion, well-balanced between the Group's three equally sized businesses, comprising one, large and specialty risks at AXA XL; two, small and medium sized risks in France, Europe, and international markets; and three, personal lines. At AXA XL Insurance, premiums were up 4% to €13 billion. Prices were up 0.3% on renewals, with the deceleration versus 1H25 predominantly in property pricing, which was down -4% in nine months versus -2% in 1H. This does not surprise us, given the low level of industry net cat losses. In financial lines, we see the quantum of decline starting to flatten. In casualty, pricing is +7% ahead of loss trends.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:03:08
Pricing in the majority of our business remains attractive, and we are growing with returns in excess of our cost of capital. In addition, our retention continues to be high. Based on what we see today and how we expect the market to evolve in the near term, we believe we can maintain AXA XL's profitability in dollar terms in this plan with a number of levers. First, better investment income. We are still replacing lower yielding assets by higher yielding assets. Two, expense management. Three, given that we are a large net buyer of reinsurance, through more favorable reinsurance pricing. Our commercial lines, XXL, comprise small and medium sized risks. You know that some of our competitors classify those as retail lines. In these lines, premiums were up 4% to €15 billion, with resilient pricing and good volume in France and international markets.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:04:22
We expect margins to expand further as higher pricing is earned through. In personal lines, revenues were up 7% to €15 billion, with good growth in both motor and non-motor. Our competitive positioning is strong. We saw close to a €1 million increase in net new contracts while we increased prices by 5%. That will drive further margin improvement as it is earned through in the next month and year. We have good momentum in personal lines, both on pricing and on volumes. Finally, in reinsurance, revenues were up 8% to €2.4 billion, primarily driven by volume growth supported by alternative capital. Our reinsurance business is today well-diversified, with the majority of premiums from non-property lines. Partnering with alternative capital will help us better navigate the cycle and manage profitability. One last point on P&C. Our net cap experience was below our operated annual budget, in line with 1H level.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:05:47
As a reminder, we managed net cap together with PYD and discount benefit. Moving on to life and health. In short-term business, revenues were up 5% to €13 billion, reflecting disciplined pricing. In long-term business, revenues were up 11% to €29 billion, driven by strong performance in unit-linked, up 17% from successful sales initiatives across all geographies. Protection was up 11%, notably in Hong Kong, reflecting a commercial campaign, as well as in Switzerland and in Japan. GA savings were up 6%, mainly driven by growth in France and in Italy. Next, on net flows. There were €5.6 billion positive year-to-date, compared to €0.9 billion last year, driven by the strong sales that I've just described and a decrease in surrenders. The improvement in net flows reflects the success of our initiatives to rejuvenate the life and savings business and will fuel our earnings growth over time.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:07:13
Moving on to new business. Life and health PVP was up 1% and NBV was down 1%. The NBV margin declined slightly to 4.5%. This results from strong sales in savings and protection, with life PVP up 7%, but that was offset by disciplined pricing and pruning measures in the multinational health and protection book, which is currently reported with AXA France Business. Overall, these measures delivered a 50 bps improvement in our health NBV margin. Life saw an unfavorable impact from actuarial changes implemented in the fourth quarter of 2024 in Japan. I want to clarify two things. One, these changes that we made last year in Japan. Do not impact profitability in the short and medium term. We can discuss that in the Q&A if you want.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:08:20
Adjusting for this change that we did last year, new business CSM on a real like-for-like basis would have been up roughly 6% at nine months 2025. Moving to solvency II. Our solvency II ratio was at 222% at the end of September, up 2 points from the first half, mainly explained by three items. First, plus 7 points from normalized capital generation, minus 6 points of accrued foreseeable dividends and annual share buybacks. Second, plus 2 points from the sale of AXA Investment Managers net of the full €3.8 billion of antidilutive share buyback currently being executed. Please note that we have taken the full impact of the share buyback, though only 63% was completed as of October 28th. Third, minus 1 point from the negative impact of debt redemption executed in July.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:09:29
We have disclosed some additional details in our press release on the impact of the end of the transitional period in solvency II. On a pro forma basis, adjusting for the loss of eligibility of grandfathered debt, you will see that our solvency ratio will still remain at strong levels. From what we saw from the European Commission a couple of days ago, we are confident that the solvency II revision, of which we will have the benefit in 2027, will lead to a significant increase in our solvency. Given the recent focus on French political risk, I would like to clarify two things. One, our solvency II ratio has zero sensitivity to the OAT spread widening. Two, on the topic of French politics, we have received many questions on the various budget amendments currently being discussed in the National Assembly.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:10:33
These discussions are similar to the ones we had last year. There is a long legislative process still ahead, and the final budget could look very different from what it may seem today. Last point on our balance sheet, given the recent rate events in the U.S. Overall, we have a high-quality investment portfolio reflecting disciplined asset allocation over the years. The vast majority is liquid fixed income invested in high-grade ratings. We have a balanced portfolio of alternative credit with strong safeguards. It comprises largely of residential mortgages, infra and agency debt with high rating, guarantees, and low leverage. We have €8.8 billion of middle-market lending book, which is highly diversified, with an average ticket size of €8 million. Skewed to non-cyclical industries. We have a private equity book of €18 billion, also well-diversified and focused on EBITDA-positive companies.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:11:49
Thanks to our strict investment guideline, we have extremely limited or no exposure to credits which have been in the news recently. To conclude, we believe we show very good numbers overall, with continued growth momentum. This is driven by our diversified and balanced business model. We are executing on our plan with disciplined growth. This gives us confidence to deliver 2025 UEPS growth at the top end of our three-year plan target range of 6% to 8%. I'm now happy to take your questions.

Firstly, on AXA XL, can you give us an update on pricing versus loss trend by main category of business in the third quarter, please? Linked to that, the volumes at AXA XL were flat in Q3 compared to last year. Could you give us some color on your growth appetite in this part of the cycle and where you're seeing the best growth opportunities, please? Secondly, on health, can you please come back on the points you were making on the French multinational health portfolio? Can you remind us the measures you're taking there and when you expect the volumes to recover and if there will be an impact on margins once that happens? Thank you.

Thank you, David. First, on pricing versus loss trend.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:13:42
If we look at the various lines, if I start with the financial lines, which is the line that started first to be softer, at this point in time, the pricing is down 4%, but clearly we see a flattening of that decrease. I think we're getting to the bottom of it. Obviously, minus 4% is below loss trend. Second, in property, as I said, we see a softer market driven by net cap. We will see benefit on net cap reinsurance next year. There again, the minus 4% is below loss trend, but I would insist on the fact that property is extremely profitable. Third, in the large lines, is casualty. Casualty is up 7%, and it is above loss trend. Overall, it's true that two of the three lines have pricing which is below loss trend.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:14:59
What we believe, and what I said in my introductory comments, is that we have other means to offset this pricing impact. Again, reinsurance, because clearly from the discussions we have with reinsurers, prices will come down in 2026. Second, investment income. Third, expenses. There is also, as you point out in your second question, the volumes aspects. At AXA XL, we are growing in a number of places. We are growing, for instance, in property, because, as I said, that's a place where pricing is good. We are also growing in specific areas that have a very dynamic momentum. When I think, for instance, in energy property, revenues for the first nine months are up 61%. You see that there are areas I mentioned this, but we also have mid-market in the U.S., which, as you know, is one of our growth initiatives.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:16:09
We are up 37% on that line. We shouldn't believe that this environment is negative, because soft or lower pricing doesn't mean unprofitable. It's still very profitable business in the vast majority of our lines. There are a good number of areas where we can grow volumes profitably. On your question on health, it's a specific business which today is reported in AXA France numbers, which is a multinational business. On this, there are two things. One, we changed some actuarial assumptions from last year, notably on mortality, because we realized we had probably too optimistic mortality assumptions, and that's an impact on our NBV, not NBCSM, but NBV, because it's a short-term business. Therefore, we are making sure that the pricing of that business is in line with our new assumptions. It's as simple as that.

The next question, sir, is from Michael Hutner of Berenberg.
Michael Huttner
Insurance Analyst
0:17:33
Thank you very much. I was finding it hard to find questions because you're so complete. Could you go back and could you give us a little bit more feel for the credit mix and exposures? I know you gave us a large array of numbers, but how can I ask it? Here, I'm not even sure. I mean, AXA's, it looks okay. What could be, if I look at it in terms of hypothetical, what could be the worst? Or if we imagine things getting a little bit worse, where would you see the risk? I think that's the best. Very, very briefly on U.K. Motor, no, U.K. and Ireland. We had this lovely presentation, I think, a month ago, but U.K. and Ireland, the pricing worsened in Q3. I just wondered if there's any comment there. Thank you.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:18:38
Thank you, Michael.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:18:41
On the credit mix exposure, I believe we have a very robust balance sheet and credit quality. Just to remind you before I talk about numbers, we sold AXA Investment Managers, but we retained 300 investment professionals in AXA. From those 300 professionals, around 50 are credit analysts. We do our credit analysis ourselves, and we give what we call the credit universe to AXA Investment Managers so that they know what to invest in when it's about listed exposure. On corporate bonds, starting with the liquid part, we have roughly €110 billion of corporate bonds with, on average, a single A rating. More importantly, we have less than €3 billion in triple B minus exposure. That's always the thing to look at because that's the risk of fall and angel. We are not concerned by that exposure.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:19:50
More generally, we have strong guidelines, notably when it comes to trade sectors. Your question was probably more on the illiquid or the private credit part. On this, we have €65 billion, but out of those €65 billion, as I've mentioned, €8 billion is really private credit, meaning loans to mid-market corporates with high diversification because it's €8 billion, but it's on average €8 million lines. You see that you have 1,000 lines. We are giving guidelines to our GPs when it comes to the covenants that we want. We want first lien, we want certain trade sectors, and they have to comply, obviously, with those guidelines. We don't give them full liberty, full freedom on the selection of the various lines. That explains why we were hardly exposed to the names in the press over the last weeks.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:20:59
In addition to that, we have residential mortgages from the Netherlands, from Switzerland in particular, for €18 billion. We have CLO tranches, AAA and AA, for another €18 billion. There, again, given the seniority, you would need a 40% loss on the CLO total to touch the first euro of our exposure in those CLOs. We also have infra debt for €8 billion. I'm looking at what am I missing. Yes, we also have commercial real estate debt for €7 billion. Diversified and, again, very well structured and with clear guidelines for our GPs. What could be a worst case? It really depends on the scenario, but as it is today with decent GDP growth all over, I'm not worried on our credit exposure. On U.K. and Ireland motor, what happened in the U.K. was that the start of the year was. Soft, but then it's stable.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:22:28
Over the last four or five months, pricing has been stable in the UK with decent profitability and growth in volumes. In Ireland, we've seen some more pressure on pricing recently. Yes.
Michael Huttner

The next question is from Andrew Baker of Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Baker
Head of European Insurance Research
0:22:56
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, just on the French buyback and dividend tax proposals. I appreciate what you're saying. It's very early. The outcome's uncertain. Are you able to just give us a sense of how you expect the process to play out? I guess, what are the key dates that we should be looking out for next? Secondly, on the grandfathered debt, should we expect you to do any further redemptions and reissuance for Solvency II eligible debt?
Andrew Baker
Head of European Insurance Research
0:23:23
Are you happy for the full impact to hit the ratio given, obviously, as you said, you've got the Solvency II review benefits coming through thereafter? Thank you.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:23:31
Sorry, Andrei. I'm not sure I understood your second question on the grandfathered debt.
Andrew Baker
Head of European Insurance Research
0:23:35
Obviously, you've done some work on that already in the second half. Should we expect you to do more? I think you've got €3 billion or so left. Should we expect you to sort of do more redemption and some reissuance for Solvency II eligible debt? How much are you willing to actually let hit the Solvency II ratio?
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:23:54
Thank you, Andrew. I'll start with the second because it's easier and faster than the first. On your question on grandfathered debt, the grandfathered debt will de facto become senior on January 1. Our view is that we will take an economic view on that debt.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:24:18
Either we need it for cash purposes and we would keep it, but at this point in time, we have plenty of cash at AXA IFA level, or we will repay it, but we don't have a lot of needs for senior debt. By the way, we don't have a lot of needs for additional subordinated debt either, given the likely increase in solvency that we will have in 2027. Now, on the political process in Parliament, first, what you understand is that today, the budget is voted line by line, amendment by amendment. That's a way for some political parties on both ends, to put it that way, to show to the electorate that they're taking the right measures. At the end of the day, next week, there will be a vote on the total budget law. It's not unlikely that that law is not voted as such.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:25:36
It then goes to the Senate. There is a back and forth between the Senate and the National Assembly. At the very end, if it's within time, the National Assembly has the last say on the budget. If it's not within time, which is 70 days, so that's probably until mid-December, I would suppose, we have no budget as such, which is exactly where we were last year. The Parliament votes a so-called special law, which is, in fact, a copy-paste of the current budget. That's exactly what happened in 2025. They couldn't agree to a budget at the end of 2024, voted that special law, and I think it was a unanimous vote of all parties because they all realized that, as opposed to what's happening in the U.S., we can't have a shutdown. That's simply not happening in France. You have a special law, which is the reconduction.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:26:48
I'm not sure it's English. It's a French word. Sorry for that. So Gallicism. The repeat of the current budget would have a slightly, but only slightly, positive impact on our budget deficit because you gain the inflation, fundamentally, on the tax threshold that you have. That's the process in the next two months. We'll see where we land.
Andrew Baker

That's really helpful. Thank you so much.

0:27:16
The next question is from Thomas Bateman of Mediobanca.
Thomas Bateman
Director of Equity Research
0:27:23
Hi. Good morning, all. Thanks very much for taking my question. The first question is just on AI. I think it's a year since you presented on the topic. I was just wondering if you could share roughly how much you're investing and how you evaluate capital allocation to these types of projects versus alternative uses of capital. The second question is just on leverage.
Thomas Bateman
Director of Equity Research
0:27:50
I was just wondering what's the best way to look at it. Obviously, you feel quite comfortable under your own gearing metric, but we seem to be quite close to the limits on Solvency II. I was just wondering what you think is the right lens to look at leveraging. Thank you.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:28:04
Thank you for your two questions. On AI, obviously, AI is very much front and center of our IT investments. To give you an idea, approximately 40% of our IT spend is investments. That being said, to be ready for AI, you need to have prepared your systems from the ground up. You need to have moved to the cloud. You need to have the right data set, and that's also where we are investing in. We are investing in getting out of mainframe.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:28:44
We have almost finalized our transition to the cloud, but you need to be ready. There's a lot of traction, obviously, and we're getting ready for that. I wouldn't say that it's only AI. It's everything that you need to get to the use of AI. When we say AI, it's predictive AI, generative AI, and agentic AI. On leverage, you're right that with the debt that we have today, the one which is grandfathered and the one that we've just issued, we have saturated our tier two capacity to the point that, as you may have seen in the press release, roughly $300 million of tier three is now a haircut. With the end of the grandfathering, the current $4.2 billion, of which you saw that we repaid $1.2 billion in October, will disappear from the tier two and tier one pockets.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:29:54
That will give us additional capacity if we want to issue in the next years. As I said previously, given what we have issued, given the uplift in solvency that we'll have in 2027, we see little needs, everything else being equal, to issue further debt.
Operator
0:30:14
The next question, sir, is from Farouk Hanif of JP Morgan.
Farooq Hanif
Head of European Insurance Equity Research
0:30:23
Hi, everybody. I hope you can hear me with my new headset. I wanted to go back to the point you made about investment income and expenses as a way of maintaining profitability at AXA XL. Of these two things that you mentioned, I mean, what's new? I'm guessing when you refer to investment income, are you talking about the fact that yields have remained higher than you planned? You're not talking about taking more risk.
Farooq Hanif
Head of European Insurance Equity Research
0:30:55
On expenses, can you talk a little bit about what would go beyond your current plan so we can understand what to add going forward? My second question is just on your credit exposure. I believe that a large proportion of this is in participating funds. Could you just talk about the shareholer versus policyholder split, roughly, so that we can have some extra comfort on that? Thank you.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:31:20
On the exit investment income, the short answer is, no, we're not taking more risk. You have two simple factors. One is we're simply growing the balance sheet with revenues, and growth in balance sheet simply means higher investment income. Second, it's the fact that we do have higher-yielding assets. Plus, I believe, but I may be wrong on this, that we probably have seen the trough in terms of PE distribution.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:32:04
You start to see a rise in M&A in the U.S., and that could lead to better distribution from PE funds going forward. I'm not counting on this. The other two factors are sufficient, but it could come on top. On expenses, I think at some point there is the project that you have and the plan that you have. By the way, we will keep investing in our initiative in the U.S. where we want to accelerate in ENF and mid-market. When the market becomes softer, there are also a number of projects that you can postpone, you can reduce, and so on. You have flexibility. I believe there's also further transformation in AXA XL on the expense side that we can think of. It will take a bit of time.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:33:02
Maybe it will not be all done in 2026, but for the next period, I believe we have some room to reduce expenses at XL and notably through AI. On credit exposure, we disclose in our financial supplement the part which is in participating fund. On average, it's 60%. I think you have some details of that in the financial supplement.
Farooq Hanif

The next question is from Andrew Crayon of Autonomous.
Andrew Crean
Senior Analyst
0:33:49
Good morning, all. Two questions. Firstly, on AXA XL's $13 billion of revenue, could you give us a bit more of a split in monetary terms between the different areas? Firstly, how much is U.S. and how much is non-U.S. of that? Secondly, when you go into the U.S.
Andrew Crean
Senior Analyst
0:34:12
side, could you give us a sense as to how much that is financial lines, property, large corporate, and then the bits which you're interested in, sort of the mid-market and the specialty lines? The second question is you've talked about the benefit of Solvency II reform in 2027. Could you give us some sense as to what you think the points benefit of that is and compare and contrast that with the potential impact on your solvency if you did a burn down or recreated the global financial crisis of 2008, 2009? What would that do to your solvency?
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:34:55
On XL, as you know, we don't disclose a lot of details, but I would say the following. One, it's roughly 50% U.S., 50% non-U.S. in terms of revenues. On volumes, I think the important thing to have in mind is the flexibility that we have.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:35:26
I gave you an example. You saw that financial lines had a soft market over the last three years. Financial lines, probably seven years ago, was $1.3 billion revenues. It went up to $2.5 billion with the hard market. It's down to $1.2 billion. You didn't see it overall because that was compensated by growth in other areas. That's the way we want to manage AXA XL, growing in some lines, decreasing in some others where it makes sense. I would insist again that we want to grow because most of our lines are still in very profitable territory. On the Solvency II reform, we are waiting for the final confirmation of the trilogue, as it's called, to have the final number. What we've said for a number of periods now is that the impact should be between 10% and 20%.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:36:36
At this stage, it's probably at the upper end of that range. I want to be cautious on this because it's not finalized yet. Things could change, and we need to take that into account. That gives you a view on how it would compare, for instance, to the points we would lose on the financial crisis. As you know, it's 30%. To be very transparent, I have not yet recalculated what the sensitivities would be in the new framework post-Solvency II revision.
Andrew Crean
Senior Analyst
0:37:19
Okay. Albert, you can't do any more on the U.S. business. In terms of looking at the different areas other than what you said about financial lines, is that where you're sticking?
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:37:33
I mean, at this stage, again, we need to be fair in our disclosure, and we are not reporting more detail than this publicly. I'm sorry for that.
Andrew Crean

The next question is from Dominic O'Mahoney of BNP Paribas.
Dominic O'Mahony
Senior Equity Analyst
0:37:58
Hello. Hello, and thank you, Adam, for such detailed responses to the questions thus far. I've got a few left. Just coming back to the AXA XL investment opportunity, I suppose I had assumed there would be some headwind from discounting from here given some of the movements, especially in the U.S. Is that fully offset, you think, by the net financial result dynamics? That's all sort of within your thinking on the sort of flat dollars of earnings. Second question is just on the retail side, and I suppose retail and SME side, there's been some commentary that frequency has been quite benign across some European markets. I was curious to hear whether that's been your experience, and if so, what you think might be driving that.
Dominic O'Mahony
Senior Equity Analyst
0:38:58
Then thirdly, just coming back to the Solvency II reforms, the percentage points could, of course, be quite large. Do you think it changes anything in the real world for you? Do you think it actually impacts your remittance capacity when you think through what sorts of entities are going to see the benefit and what drives their remittance capacity? Do you see any impact there, and/or do you think it changes your incentives on asset allocation? Do you anticipate any mix shift in that? Thank you.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:39:30
Thank you, Dominic. On AXA XL investment and discount. As you know, discount has two components. One is the rates, and you need to look at, on average, the five-year rate. There is some volatility in that rate coming from the tension between budget deficits on one hand and lower growth on the other hand.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:40:04
Our belief is that it will remain at a high level compared at least to history. That's the first point. The second point is also the duration of your current year claims. You saw that in half-year, for instance, we kept a strong level of discount benefit because the mix of lines was skewed to more long-tail lines, which is normal because when you see that casualty in AXA XL has price increases of 7%, by definition, you grow your casualty lines faster than your short-tail lines. That also explains why we believe that the discount benefit should remain at a reasonable level and therefore should not be a strong headwind going forward. On frequency for retail, yes, I think it's true that we have better frequency in motor than last year, simply also because it was less rainy in Europe than last year. That's as basic as that.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:41:22
We do see an improvement, and that's why when we see this, plus the 5% price increase on average in motor, we believe that we have some room to improve margin. On the Solvency II reform, what I would suggest is that when we disclose our numbers in February, we give you the full view on how much it will really mean, both in terms of solvency and in terms of remittance. I think at this stage, it's too early given that we don't know yet what the outcome will be. Sorry for that.
Dominic O'Mahony

Michael Huttner
Insurance Analyst
0:42:15
Thank you so much. Just to reinforce buying, so I'm working out that it's a $300 million benefit.
Michael Huttner
Insurance Analyst
0:42:23
I just wanted to see if my math is right. I'm assuming very rough numbers, $2 billion kind of protection, so $3 billion premiums. My numbers are probably incredibly wrong. Price decline of 10%, so that's $300 million. Then on Japan, you said if we asked, you'd explain why the low margin is kind of not particularly meaningful for earnings now. Thank you.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:42:48
Sorry, Michael, could you repeat your first question? I'm not sure I got it.
Michael Huttner
Insurance Analyst
0:42:54
It's just on the benefit of lower reinsurance cost. I tried to work out a number. I mean, it's a bit, I'm assuming $3 billion total premiums, 10% decline, that's $300 million, but I have no idea. I'm just making it up. I just wanted to know.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:43:10
Okay. I would say what we see is clearly a market where prices are coming down, notably on nat cat.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:43:22
It's also positive for reinsurance buyers on long-tail lines, but the more important impact will be on short-tail property. It's probably a bit difficult to say at this stage how much it will be, and it's still being negotiated with our insurers. I would rather not taint that discussion with reinsurance, and I will tell you in February what the outcome is. Net net, there is obviously a strong benefit for us. On Japan, the actual changes we made in Japan were the following. We realized two things. One was that surrenders were slightly higher than what we had projected, so we increased our surrender rate in our projection. As such, it has no bearing or hardly any on next year's earnings because what it means fundamentally is that you will have fewer policies in 20 or 30 years.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:44:30
That's an impact, but not that you will have lower margin next year. Second, there are some products that we modeled better, notably introducing options and guarantees in the modeling, so TVOGs. There again, when you unwind your CSM, you unwind those TVOGs, and that has no bearing on your earnings. This new business CSM last year was impacted because of that in a risk-neutral environment, but with no impact on our real-world earnings short to medium term. Compared to those numbers, we grew new business CSM this year by 6% if you adjust. We believe it's a good performance.

Andrew Baker
Head of European Insurance Research
0:45:41
Are you able to give us a little bit more color on what specific lines you're writing here? I guess I'm just trying to square the 7% price increases being above loss cost trends. Any additional color there would be helpful. Thank you.
Alban de Mailly Nesle
Group CFO
0:45:54
We are obviously writing a lot of lines, both in the U.S. and international. We do primary and excess in the U.S. We do construction casualty and so on. There are different dynamics in those lines. I would say it's probably lower price increases in international casualty and higher price increases in excess casualty in the U.S. Overall, it comes to 7%, but the underlying dynamic of the loss trend is obviously different if you compare Europe and U.S., and even within U.S., primary versus excess.

Yes, thank you, Sharon. Hello everybody, and thank you for attending this conference call. I am today with Thierry Merville, Deputy CFO of Vinci, Gregoire Thibault and the Investor Relations team, and Marie-Amélie Afol, the Group Controller. As usual, I will be brief to have more time for the Q&A session. What are the key takeaways of this publication? First, a solid operating performance year to date, driven in particular by dynamic business levels in energy solutions and concessions. Q3 total revenue was strong and up by almost 5%, 4.7% exactly, and 3.5% like for like. The positive inflection versus H1 reflects both a good momentum across the group's business line during the quarter and also the positive impact of the integration of the recently acquired companies. Some were acquired in 2024, others were acquired in the beginning of this year.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:01:28
Thus, nine months' revenue totaled EUR 54.3 billion, up almost 4% actual, 3.7%, and 2% like for like. International nine months' revenue represented 58% of the total. It was up 5.3% and up 2.3% like for like. We have a significant impact of the acquisitions. Changes of scope over the period represent 4.4%+ impact on the international revenue, mainly coming from the acquisition of Vinci Construction, which contributed for around EUR 600 million, of which FM Conway in the U.K. for almost EUR 500 million. Conway was acquired at the beginning of this year, and the closing was performed end of January. We should mention also the acquisition of Vinci Energies, which boosted revenue by around EUR 450 million on the first nine months, and also, obviously, the integration of Edinburgh Airport by Vinci Airports. Do you remember that Edinburgh Airport was acquired in the first half of last year?
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:02:43
The contribution to the nine-month revenue represents EUR 324 million. On the other hand, exchange rate movements had a negative impact of 1.3% on international revenue, as the euro rose against many currencies, particularly the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Australian and New Zealand dollars, and also several Latin American currencies, in particular the Mexican peso. In France, 42% of the total revenue was up 1.6% for the first nine months of the year, plus 4% in the third quarter, which is a very resilient trend in the current environment. I will come back more in detail on the trends for each business later. Second key takeaway, number two, group's nine-month order intake, EUR 46.9 billion. We see the rather limited decrease of 3% year-on-year.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:03:42
As already flagged in our previous release, this slight decrease is due to the high comps because Vinci, you remember, won several very large projects last year, particularly the two HVDC platforms for Cobra IS in the North Sea for German utilities. On the other hand, we should mention the integration of Conway, which partially balances, but not entirely, the impact of the two platforms. Beyond that, it's worth noting that order intake in Q3 2025 posted a positive inflection and was up 4% versus Q3 2024. Order intake for flow business, which accounts for the large majority of the group's revenue from the energy solution and construction businesses, remains firm and increased by more than 2% in the first nine months. This is despite a reinforced selective approach in some areas, for instance, in Latin America for Cobra IS.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:04:50
We should mention also the fact that the level of order intake in the first nine months was higher than that of revenue, both in energy solution, EUR 22.3 billion versus EUR 20.7 billion, and for VINCI Construction, EUR 24.6 billion versus EUR 23.8 billion. This means that the order book continues to grow at a good renewal rate. Thus, the order book of Vinci maintained a high level of almost EUR 71 billion at the end of September, which is a growth of 6% year-on-year. This is for each business: VINCI Energies +8%, Cobra IS +6%, Construction plus 4%. It represents 14 months of average activity. International made up 70% of the order book versus 68% last year.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:05:41
Such a robust order book gives good visibility and enables Vinci to continue to remain extremely selective in a turbulent economic and geopolitical environment and continue to give priority to the margin improvements and to the cash generation. Regarding the financial position, the net financial debt of the group at the end of September is well under control. It amounted to EUR 21.4 billion, which is a difference between a gross debt of EUR 33.7 billion and a net cash of EUR 12.3 billion. The net debt is down EUR 800 million year-on-year. Obviously, Vinci's liquidity remains substantial, apart from the cash I just mentioned at the end of September. We should mention also the EUR 6.5 billion of revolving credit facility, which is unused at the holding level.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:06:37
As a result, with such a sound financial position, Vinci is well prepared to continue to develop in good condition and with serenity with a disciplined cash allocation policy. Let's now have a closer look at the main divisions. First, concessions. Concessions, nine months' revenue of EUR 9.4 billion at 5%, mirroring solid growth in both pax numbers at airports and traffic on motorways in France and abroad. For VINCI Autoroutes in France, nine months' revenue, EUR 5.2 billion, up 2.7%, with traffic up 1.4%, of which light vehicles 1.5% and trucks 0.8%. This is despite two fewer working days versus last year. In Q3, traffic was only slightly up, plus 0.3%, with the trucks up 1.2%, despite unfavorable calendar effects. One fewer working day in Q3 versus Q3 last year. VINCI Airports' revenue, EUR 3.7 billion, was up 6.6%.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:07:47
After a firm demand of travel during the summer, the worldwide network of VINCI Airports welcomed 253 million pax in the first nine months, up almost 6% year-on-year. You already received last week the details of VINCI Airports' performance. Let's remind that the traffic growth was particularly remarkable in Japan, boosted both by the World Expo of Osaka and the renewed momentum of routes with China. Traffic was up 12% in Japan. Mexico, where routes with the U.S. remain dynamic, plus 9.6%, and the recently acquired Edinburgh, +7.3%, and Budapest, +12% airports, which benefited from demand for flights to the Mediterranean destinations in particular. For energy solutions, made up of VINCI Energies and Cobra IS, revenue totaled EUR 20.7 billion, up 7% on an actual basis, including an 8% growth in Q3. This was driven by business outside France, which accounted for 69% of the total revenue.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:09:02
Order intake remained firm overall. The momentum confirms that the energy solutions business is strongly positioned in its markets, which are supported by positive megatrends in electricity production and transport and digital infrastructure, as well as in defense and sovereignty challenges. In energy solutions, let's have a look at VINCI Energies first, which printed once more a very strong performance. Nine months' revenue of VINCI Energies amounted to EUR 15.3 billion, up 5.6% actual and 2.5% like for like. Business levels remain firm in most of VINCI Energies' markets: France, +4% in Q3; Germany, which is VINCI Energies' largest market outside of France; Belgium and the Netherlands; Scandinavian countries; and the U.S.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:10:00
Order intake remained solid and was up 2% in Q3, 1% in the first nine months, so that the order book of VINCI Energies reached an all-time high of EUR 18.1 billion, of which 62% outside France, up 8% year-on-year, representing more than 10 months of VINCI Energies' average business activity. Furthermore, please note that VINCI Energies remains active on the M&A front, having completed 25 acquisitions in the first nine months, which represent a cumulative annual revenue of more than EUR 400 million, of which 80% in Germany and 8% in North America. The main transactions closed in late August were R+S Group and Zimmer & Halbrig in the building solutions businesses in Germany. In addition, keep in mind that the two other significant acquisitions announced in July should be finalized by the end of the year.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:11:00
These are Wertzinlich Sun Electronics in Germany, which operates in the field of electrical system integration and automation for the German Navy in particular. The second one is Energobit in Romania, which specializes in engineering and works for electrical infrastructure. Overall, these 25 companies newly acquired or about to be acquired will generate a combined annual revenue on a full-year basis of over EUR 600 million, mostly in Europe. Within VINCI Energy Solution, let's now move to Cobra IS. Nine months' revenue of Cobra IS amounted to EUR 5.4 billion, up 10% actual and like for like, which illustrates the strong momentum of Cobra in most activities.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:11:51
EPC projects, representing 43% of the total revenue, delivered a stellar growth of 32%, resulting from progress on strategic energy solution and sovereignty projects in many countries, including Germany, with its HVDC converter platforms and the country's first LNG regasification terminal, then Brazil with power transmission lines, and Australia with the start of a large power transmission contract as part of the PPP of 35 years. On the other hand, flow business activities, 57% of the total, remain in Europe at a very high level. Outside Europe, the slight decrease reflects an increase in activity in some Latin American countries in addition to adverse currency effects. Order intake decreased, but again, to put things into context, remember that the level reached last year was outstanding. Remember, it included, in particular, two orders totaling EUR 2.5 billion for offshore wind farms, energy converters platform in Germany.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:13:02
Remember also that these very long-cycle HVDC platforms projects will not generate revenue before several years because the yards, the two yards of Cobra IS in southern Spain, are overbooked, but they will provide us with a long-term visibility. The order book of Cobra IS at 30th September 2025 remained at a very high level and amounted to EUR 17.3 billion, up 6% year-on-year, which represents more than two years of Cobra IS average business activity. Please also note that some projects won and announced recently are not yet in the order book of Cobra IS, of which the electrification of the rail network, Rail Baltica. Vinci Construction should be noted. First, that the revenue of VINCI Construction rose by 4% in Q3, 3% on the like-for-like basis, with growth driven by France, up 6%.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:14:01
As a result, VINCI Construction revenue in the first nine months of the year reached EUR 23.8 billion, up 1% actual, and down 1% like-for-like. Year-on-year, year to date, excuse me, year to date, this change reflects varying market conditions depending on the country and on the business sector since the start of the year. Lower revenue from major projects for reasons relating to the phasing of ongoing projects. Increase of revenue in France thanks to a good momentum, particularly in roadworks, in waterworks, and railworks. Higher business levels in continental Europe and Africa. Stability in the U.S., but decreases in other regions, such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, due particularly to adverse currency effects. Lastly, slight growth in revenue from specialty networks, so les tranches racinées. Q3 was strong as well in terms of order intake, up 12%.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:15:10
As a consequence, order intake at the end of September are back in the positive territory versus last year, slight up by 1%. The order book of VINCI Construction at 30th September 2025 amounted to EUR 35.1 billion, up 4% year-on-year, and representing more than 13 months of VINCI Construction's average business activity. Finally, VINCI Immobilier, the real estate business. Revenue grew by 3% in Q3, limiting the decline in the nine-month period to +2%. The number of housing units reserved by VINCI Immobilier in France at the end of September were down 8%, but rose by 10% in Q3. Probably still much too it is still much too early to open champagne, but a welcome positive inflation risk. Finally, please note that VINCI and ACS Group signed an agreement definitively settling the 2021 acquisition of Cobra IS.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:16:17
The main terms of this agreement signed during the quarter are as follows: one, earnout was set at a fixed amount of EUR 318 million versus a cap of EUR 600 million in the initial agreement, EUR 318 million instead of EUR 600 million, with a balance of EUR 200 million to be paid, which was paid by Vinci in September. We had paid EUR 80 million previously. Second, termination by Vinci and ACS of their original agreement relating to a joint venture carrying out renewable energy projects developed by Cobra IS. In a nutshell, we paid a lower earnout than initially planned while taking back the full control of our strategy regarding renewable energy developments.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:17:10
In conclusion, despite the turbulent macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, the excellent overall performance of Vinci's businesses in the first nine months of the year once again demonstrates the strength of the group's multilocal model, its highly decentralized organization, and its resilience. Vinci therefore confirmed its 2025 guidelines. To wrap up, Vinci expects its total revenue and earnings to rise again in 2025 before factoring in the increase in corporate tax rates in France. Thank you for your attention. Before taking your questions, I would like to emphasize that I will not make any comment on the current discussions at the French Parliament regarding the national budget for 2026, as these discussions are at a very early stage and may sometimes appear as quite erratic. Thank you again. I'm now ready to answer your questions.

Good evening. Luis Prieto here. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple of quick ones. The first one is if you could shed some additional light on why you dropped from the I-285 Managed Lanes process in Atlanta. Does this mean you're no longer interested in the space? The second question is regarding the next steps in Gatwick after September's development consent grant. Thank you very much.

Hello, sir. The speaker line is currently muted, just to confirm.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:19:53
Oh, okay. Yes, we put the line on mute by mistake. The answer for Atlanta is very simple. I think we have explained on many occasions our way of approaching the management market in the U.S. We have no local presence in Atlanta, so we are not comfortable with the local environment. You know that for taking this type of risk, we consider it essential to have a local partner. We don't want to go on our own. We have not a local partner in the area of Atlanta. We analyze the risk, and finally, we consider that the risk reward was not, we were not comfortable with the risk reward situation in this particular case.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:20:33
The second question was, next step is a period which can last between one and two years to get, I would say, remarks from the stakeholder in the area of Gatwick about the term of the proposal we made for extending the capacity of the airport.
Luis Prieto
Equity Analyst
0:21:04
Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator
0:21:08
Thank you. We will now go to the next question. The next question comes from Elodie Rall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Elodie Rall
Equity Research Analyst
0:21:21
Yeah. Hi. Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on the airport division. Maybe a bit of a naive one, but revenues were a bit below our expectations. I was wondering if you could shed some light on it because traffic was up 4.2% in Q3, but revenue only came up at 0.8%. Maybe you can help us understand the impact from tariffs and FX on that division. My second question is on whether you have any views on the German plan. We've seen some preliminary budget for 2026, which look a bit flat. I was wondering if you could give us a bit your views on when you think that these plans will start showing up in order intakes for your group. Thanks very much.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:22:43
Elodie, about the airport business, there is a perimeter effect in France because we have the impact of the deconsolidation of the non-airports this year, which we had not last year. There are also some significant currency effects in Mexico, particularly. These are the main factors that I have in mind to answer your point. As for Germany, you know, the German are very serious people. Before launching in practice what they have said they intend to do, they do a preparation work, which can take some time, both on the infrastructure side and on the defense side. We expect no impact of this plan in the short term. I read somewhere that one of our big colleagues present in the production of aggregates was considering a potential impact not before 2027. Maybe it will be before, but not much before.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:23:48
The good news is that we have much enough job to do. Germany has not a very dynamic demography, and we are very big in Germany. We make a lot of projects in all divisions, and manpower is clearly an issue. If it takes a bit more time to start, in practice, the launching of this plan, it's rather a good news than a bad news. We will see the thing in the long run, rather in the short run.
Elodie Rall
Equity Research Analyst
0:24:20
Okay, thank you.
Christian Labeyrie
CFO
0:24:22
Exposition, which is like the one we made this year, the three significant ones we made this year, is a way to acquire production means. You know, when you acquire a company, it means you acquire a team. You acquire technicians, workers, engineers, etc. It's very important if you want to continue to grow on a very interesting market for us.

One moment, please. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Lemaire from CIC. Please go ahead.
Eric Lemarié
Sell Side Equity Analyst
0:25:09
Yes. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I got two, actually. First, in France, I appreciate that you don't want to make any comments on the current discussion on the budget today. Regarding this political situation in France, do you see any impact on your clients in France? I mean, do you see any investment decision delayed due to this situation? This is my first question. I have a second question on Germany. Elodie mentioned this German plan. Do you see that there could be an acceleration maybe in air models in Germany along with the German plans? Could you remind us today of your exposure to Germany, all businesses combined, including the last acquisition you made in the energy business? Thank you.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:26:14
The potential impact of the French mess on our clients, honestly, so far no. What we expect is an impact on, but this is not due to what is happening at the Parliament presently, it's more due to the election calendar. You know that next year, in March, will take place local election in France, which means electing the mayors of the cities or renewing the existing mayors. This happens every six years. Last time was in 2020, in the middle of COVID. In this period, which is just before the election rendezvous, we see a slowdown in terms of order in the roadwork business in particular. It's not really new, and we know how to cope with that. We have a system in France which permits us to be flexible in the running of the manpower in order to avoid idle costs.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:27:23
We expect that this phenomenon will happen again, which is like it happens every six years. This is not really linked to the discussion ongoing in the French Parliament. The second question was relating to Germany. Do you want to know about the exposure to Germany? Germany, on a full-year basis, but this was last year, so it will be probably certainly more this year, was EUR 5.6 billion of revenue. I suppose this year we should be around EUR 6 billion, but I don't have a precise figure to give you. It will go considering the acquisition that we have closed, which will not produce their full effect on 2025, but more on 2026. I would say around 60% of the revenue we generate in Germany is generated by VINCI Energies, so it's essentially small, low-risk projects in all types of sectors: industry, building solutions, new technologies, infrastructures.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:28:34
VINCI Energies employed more than 16,000 people on nearly 400 sites. We are very densely settled in the country. VINCI Construction, but this is essentially road paving, makes around EUR 1.5 billion of revenue. We have a synergy developed thanks to Eurovia in order to be a leading company on the PPP and the A model or B model market, which consists in modernizing, widening roads, motorways, within the PPP contracts. We have presently five PPPs under operation or under construction. I think one is under construction, four are under operation. Two have a traffic risk, and three have not. Finally, Cobra, but Cobra is gaining ground. Presently, Cobra, last year, performed less than EUR 1 billion of revenue. It should be more this year. This is essentially represented by these large projects in the North Sea. They have also some flow business.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:29:47
Cobra IS is also present in flow business in Germany. Vinci Group is present in Germany in all its activities. It's a major country for us. It's the second after the UK and obviously after France. Outside of France, it's the second largest market for us. It represents around 20% of our present order book.
Eric Lemarié

0:30:15
Thank you.
Operator
0:30:17
Thank you. We will now go to the next question. The next question comes from the line of Nicolas Mora from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nicolas Mora
Executive Director
0:30:30
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple from me. On VINCI Energies, so you're trending around 2%-3% organic growth. Orders are what, stuck between 1% and 2% year-on-year growth. Are we on that same line into the back end of the year and the start of 2026? You're not seeing any, I guess, I mean, you were sounding cautious early on, but you're not seeing any further slowdown. It's just basically slightly hovering above flat, but not much, closing of projects at the back end of the year. That's the first question. Second, on M&A, thanks for the details on VINCI Energies. Outside of very small bolt-ons, and the deal announced late July, is there anything else in the pipeline? Actually, both on VINCI Energies and concessions, we're not picking up much.
Nicolas Mora
Executive Director
0:31:31
I was just wondering if you still had a pipeline ahead of you that was worth maybe mentioning with us. Thank you.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:31:42
You know that on the second question, we never disclosed the potential needs which are in our pipeline. As for the forecast for the year, we stick to what we said in the previous releases about the evolution of our activity and of our margins for all business lines, including VINCI Energies. I have nothing to add to what we have already said and reaffirmed in our present release. I just want to highlight the fact that the order book of VINCI Energies reached an all-time high of EUR 18.1 billion, which is a lot. We present 10 months of activity as an average. It's essentially small projects, low-risk projects.
Nicolas Mora
Executive Director
0:32:39
Sure. In terms of the, let's say, the clean year-on-year, you're holding up okay, but you're not seeing any acceleration from where we stand right now. I guess 1%-2% year-on-year growth in orders is going to translate into kind of similar growth over the next three to six months.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:33:06
I don't know if I mentioned it, but in France, the order book and the revenue in Q3 is up 4%. It's more than the previous quarter. It probably means also that it's not always relevant to analyze very much in detail quarter by quarter because you can have phasing issues and seasonal issues, even for the revenue in the vacation period, for instance. We keep the forecast we already released, and we are obviously very positive. VINCI Energies and Cobra IS are one of the growth drivers of the group for the future, not only because of organic potential of growth, but also potential of acquisition, as you know.
Nicolas Mora
Executive Director
0:33:52
Okay. If I may, last one, just on the net debt figure you provide, I mean, if we go backwards, work from there towards the free cash and net working capital, there is nothing to say on payment cycle, payment terms, prepayments, business. Is it business as usual or there's anything to mention?
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:34:18
The fact that we entered less large projects this year compared to last year, particularly at Cobra IS, has obviously an impact on the cash advance payments. When you have less large projects, you have less advance payments. We compensate this at the level, at least of the order book or the revenue, through an increased flow business activity. We don't have any significant swing to mention at this stage of the year, except remember that last year, in December, we had very significant collections, which we cannot, for the time being, assume that we will have again this year. That's why we were very cautious about any forecast at the level of the working capital requirement variation.
Nicolas Mora
Executive Director
0:35:18
All right. Very clear. Thank you.
Operator
0:35:21
Thank you. Your next question.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:35:24
At the level of the debt, you can see that the debt is well under control, which is a mix of different things: capex, which are more or less stable, acquisitions, which are less significant than last year, and operational cash flow, which is in a good situation. We will have to pay, I will remind you, we have to pay at the end of the year more than EUR 400 million additional tax to the French government. This has to be taken into account also when you try to make projections of free cash flows.
Operator
0:36:03
Thank you. We will now go to the next question. Your next question comes from the line of Graham Hunt from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Graham Hunt
Managing Director and Equity Analyst
0:36:13
Hi. Thank you for the questions. I've just got two. First one on construction, and apologies if I missed this in the remarks. Just the inspection there and in France, is there some pull forward that we should be thinking about for Q4 phasing there? Is that sort of Q3 pull forward some work that helps that number? The second question, just when we think about the overall EBITDA number for airports, how should we think about the new airport that you've added in Cambodia, the management contract there, the operating contract there, sorry? Also, just in light of the pricing that was negative in Q3, should we be factoring anything in there in terms of our estimates for second half EBITDA for the airports? Thank you.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:37:09
Don't comment about EBITDA. That's not the purpose of the release. The purpose of the release is to comment on the activity, the order intake and order book, and the cash position, net cash position, and net investments. It's not to comment about the figures in the detailed figures of the P&L. We don't make any comment about the EBITDA of such or such activity. What was the question about construction? Hold on a second. Graham, about Cambodia, you know very well our activities in Cambodia. We used to be a concessionaire of the Phnom Penh Airport. Our concession contract has been finished, terminated, but we have been quite good since we have obtained to run the new airport, which has been developed by local investors, but which had many lots of money, but maybe not enough practice to efficiently manage an airport. We effectively obtained a management contract.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:38:35
You know, obviously, that's a management contract. You cannot generate the same level of EBITDA in terms of margin versus a concessionaire EBITDA since we don't have, we have not invested any single, I don't know what is the currency of Cambodia. We have not invested a single dollar in this new airport. We are very pleased to have secured this management contract, which permits us to still be a partner to the local authorities, thanks to this management contract, and also to the concession of Sienneville on the coast. The last question was relating to construction. Maybe you remember that in the past, on several occasions, we highlighted the fact that the activity level in construction might change due to some phasing effects on large projects.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:39:26
When you finish a project and you start a new one, it can take some months before you generate the normalized level of activity. It's exactly what happened in the first quarter. In the third quarter, we have some large projects which we won last year, particularly at the Grand Paris Line, 15 West, which is linking our head office in Nanterre to the Bridge of Sèvres in the south-west of Paris. It's a very large conception construction project, which is increasing the pace at which the work is performed. This is part of the explanation. We have some other projects like that which contribute to the growth of VINCI Construction in France in the third quarter.

Marcin Wojtal
Senior Equity Analyst
0:40:40
Oh, yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on your net debt number, which you reported at EUR 21.4 billion, which I believe is almost EUR 2 billion reduction versus H1. Quite a significant number. Could you clarify, is that a good proxy for free cash flow generation in the quarter, which seems to be quite high, or were there maybe some other impacts? I don't know. Maybe a reduction in the debt due to FX effects or any other factors. Thank you.
Christian Labeyrie
EVP and CFO
0:41:15
I will not make comment about the free cash flow for the same reason as I don't want to make any comment about the EBITDA margin. It's not the purpose of this first quarter information. It's a combination of different things: CapEx, working capital change, EBITDA generation, etc., etc. I will not disclose more details. I'm sorry. You have to be a bit patient and wait a few months before you can give more detail, more color about the cash flow situation of the group for this year.

Marcin, just to give you a so that you are not too frustrated. You know that in the summer, we have a very strong activity in the motorways in particular, but also on the airport. We have cash collections, which are at a high level during this period of the year, which is part of the explanation why the free cash flow has improved during the summer. If you look at the curves that we produce on a regular basis to compare the evolution of the free cash flow along the year on the previous year, you will see that it's always the same. Starting in June, July, you have a significant improvement of the cash flow of the group, which is around zero and even negative in the first half of the year. It's a normal evolution, I would say, considering the seasonal profile of the Vinci activities.

Pierre-Roch Pascal, and let us go straight to the key highlights. We had a strong start to the year with a very solid momentum across both civil, aerospace, and defense. Revenue was up 17% year-on-year, nearly 14% organically, reaching EUR 7.3 billion. Growth was, once again, driven by a robust demand for aftermarket across the board. In particular, on civil engines, sales of spare parts were up by 25%, exceeding our expectations, and sales of services increased by close to 18%. On the strategic front, we have made good progress toward the acquisition of Collins Aerospace actuation and flight control activities, with the obtaining of the European Commission approval, subject to ongoing analysis on the divestment of North American electromechanical actuation business and Woodward's suitability as a purchaser. The close of the consultation period by the CMA in the U.K. on this divestment. Decisions are still pending."

Welcome to the Safran Third Quarter 2025 Revenue. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your hosts, Olivier Andriès, Safran's CEO, and Pascal Bantegnie, Group CFO. Mr. Andriès, please go ahead.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:00:18
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Safran's Third Quarter 2025 call. I'm here with Pascal. Let us start with the key highlights of the quarter. Safran delivered another strong performance in Q3, with IT growth driven by increased volume and services. Adjusted sales reached €7.9 billion. Civil aftermarket remained robust, reflecting continued demand from airlines. Spare parts for civil engines were up 16%, largely thanks to CFM56, while services grew by 24%, supported by LEAP, Red Perfect, Hammer contracts. Regarding LEAP engine deliveries, output has improved quarter after quarter this year. After a slow start, we have been able to catch up on delays, and in Q3, we reached a new record with over 500 LEAP engines delivered, up 40% year on year and 25% from the previous quarter.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:01:35
Over the first nine months of the year, we have delivered a total of 1,240 LEAP engines, a 21% increase compared to last year. These strong results also reflect continued improvements across our supply chain. In addition to these strong operational results, we are excited about our recent acquisition of the actuation and flight control activities from Collins Aerospace, finalized at the end of July. The strategic move has already contributed to our Q3 performance. Integration is off to a great start. Our teams are fully engaged and focused on unlocking cost synergies and new commercial opportunities. We are confident that this acquisition will be a strong driver for Safran's future performance. Looking at the year-to-date picture, adjusted revenue for the first nine months amounted to €22.6 billion, up 15% organically, confirming a strong growth trajectory across all divisions.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:02:42
Based on this performance, we are upgrading our full-year 2025 outlook on all metrics. Turning to slide four, let me highlight some of our key business achievements this quarter. Last week in Morocco, we broke ground on a new LEAP MRO facility and announced the launch of a new LEAP 1A assembly line in Casablanca. This expansion strengthens our global industrial footprint and will support the sustained ramp-up of the LEAP engine deliveries in the years ahead, with the capacity to assemble up to 350 engines per year. In defense, Safran and Rheinmetall signed a framework agreement to jointly develop advanced defense solutions, combining our expertise in optronics, navigation system environments, and atomic clocks, time servers, with Rheinmetall's land defense capabilities. At the 2025 Defense and Security Equipment International Show in London, Safran unveiled its next-generation infrared binoculars, setting new standards for tactical observation and situational awareness.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:03:56
Lastly, in Poland, Safran and PGZ entered into a strategic defense partnership to foster local industrial cooperation and innovation. The agreement covers industrial cooperation on the Hammer precision munition and the local production of GeoDix navigation system with PGZ. Let me now hand over to Pascal for more details on Q3 sales.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:04:21
Thank you, Olivier. Good morning all. A few words to start with on the FX, as usual. After a sharp rise in the first part of the year, the euro-dollar stabilized around 1.16 to 1.17 since early July. Our hedging portfolio has remained fully protected so far, with no deactivations to date. The team is continuing to hedge our 2029 exposure at very good rates. Our 2025 hedge rate is confirmed at $1.12 per euro, and the hedge book now totals $54 billion as of end September, unchanged from the end of June. Overall, our approach to FX risk has kept us well protected, ensuring attractive hedge rates and supporting Safran's competitiveness in a challenging market environment. Turning to slide seven, Q3 revenue reached €7.9 billion, up 18% year over year. The currency impact was a negative €300 million, mainly reflecting the euro appreciation against the U.S.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:05:28
dollar, with an average spot rate of 1.17 in Q3 compared to 1.10 last year. The scope largely offsets the negative currency impact, contributing €300 million, primarily driven by two-month consolidation of the actuation and flight control activities acquired from Collins Aerospace. In total, the group generated over €1.2 billion in additional organic revenue versus last year, fueled by growth in every division, with propulsion leading the way. On slide eight, let me now provide a few details per activity. Propulsion revenue reached €4 billion, up 26%. Civil OE grew strongly. Q3 was a record quarter with 511 LEAP engines delivered, up 40% year over year and up 25% sequentially. Civil aftermarket remained very dynamic, with spare parts up 16%, mainly driven by CFM56 and LEAP engines, both of them benefiting from sustained volumes and higher work scope. CFM56 gross prices were up mid to high single digits in August.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:06:43
LEAP also contributed positively over the period. In the first nine months, spare parts sales were up 19.5% at the top end of our guidance. Services were up 24%, mainly driven by LEAP RPFH contracts, but also LEAP engine service contracts. Over nine months, services increased by 22.2% beyond our guidance, but as you know, it has no additional EBIT impact given our profit recognition methodology. Military engine revenue declined year over year, notably due to a softer level of aftermarket activity and slightly fewer M88 deliveries to end customers. Equipment and defense revenue increased by 12% to €3 billion, with both OE and aftermarket growing at a similar pace. Higher OE sales were fueled by aircraft ramp-up, driving increased demand for landing gear, electrical and power systems, nacelles, and avionics.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:07:48
Defense also continued to benefit from strong momentum, especially in the guided bomb, Hammer, missile seekers, navigation, and timing systems. Services continued to perform well, supported by strong air traffic levels, which resulted in ongoing demand, in particular for landing systems, electrical systems, and nacelles. Aircraft interiors, post-deal revenue of €800 million, up 10%. OE sales increased by 12%, supported by steady growth in the cabin business, benefiting from aircraft ramp-up. Business class seat deliveries, however, faced headwinds from certification, which remains a key challenge in the sector. Services were up 7%, driven by cabin activities, with very good momentum in the Middle East and Asia. A few additional points on slide nine. First, on the share buyback program, as of October 17, we hold approximately 5.1 million treasury shares designated for cancellation, and we are currently finalizing the ongoing €500 million tranche, which will be completed by December 5th.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:09:01
All these shares, representing a total of €1.4 billion, will be canceled by the end of 2025. Some updates on the tariff environment. Now that bilateral agreements have been negotiated, we are better positioned to assess and manage the risk associated with tariffs. The agreement between the U.S. and the EU, as well as the eligibility of our products under the USMCA regime, have significantly reduced the amounts at stake. In this fluid environment, Safran remains agile and actively continues to implement mitigation measures and commercial actions. Nonetheless, a residual impact remains, primarily related to flows between China and the U.S., what we call Section 232 on aluminum, steel, copper, or products which are not eligible under bilateral agreements. The net impact on the recurring operating income, which is now included in the full-year 2025 outlook, is expected to be a negative €100million-€150 million in 2025. Olivier, back to you.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:10:14
Thank you, Pascal. Based on the strong performance over the first nine months, we are upgrading our full-year 2025 outlook on all metrics. Revenue should increase by 11%-13%. Recurring operating income guidance is improved by €100 million at midpoint and now includes the expected net tariff impact, as Pascal just commented. Free cash flow guidance is improved by €100 million at midpoint, reflecting the improved business performance. Two of our main assumptions are updated. LEAP engine deliveries are now expected to increase by more than 20% versus 2024. With increased activity in LEAP, maintenance services are now expected to grow by low to mid-twenties, with no additional EBIT associated due to our specific profit recognition methodology.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:11:17
In addition to this outlook, the Collins Aerospace flight control and actuation activity should contribute at around €650 million of revenue, with a mid-single-digit recurring operating margin before separation and integration costs. Overall, Safran remains on track to deliver another year of profitable growth and robust cash generation, supported by healthy demand, solid execution, and the resilience of our portfolio. Thank you. We will now answer your question.
Operator
0:11:53
Thank you. To ask a question, you will need to press star one and one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one and one again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A queue. Thank you. We will now take our first question. This is from Christophe Menard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Christophe Menard
Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst
0:12:23
Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I had two, actually. The first one is on the guidance upgrade on the EBIT. Now that you include the tariffs, it means we have the equivalent of a $200 million incremental improvement. Where is this coming from? Is it essentially spares? Can you elaborate? The second one is on Morocco. You're talking about an increase in production capacity. Is it enough for you to reach rate 75 in 2027, or do you need further investment? Thank you.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:13:03
Good morning, Christoph. I'll take the first one. Indeed, we raise our guidance by €100 million, but as it takes now into account the €100-€150 million impact from tariffs, the underlying performance is a raise of €200-€250 million. It's coming primarily from the spare sales. You can see that at the end of the first nine months, we are at the high end of our guidance, which is mid to high twenties for spare parts sales at 19.5%. To be frank, we could have been more positive at the end of July, but at that time, we didn't have such clarity on tariffs. Now that the dust has settled, it's easier for us to mitigate the impact and quantify the impact. This is the two reasons why we can raise today the guidance.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:14:05
Christoph, I have a second question relating to Morocco. This investment is allowing us to meet the high rates requested by our FMR customers relating to the assembly of the engines and to the assembly of the engines. We have to look at it holistically between the assembly capacity, let's say, from our partner GE and our own assembly capacity. Indeed, this new investment allows us to meet, let's say, the rate increase, the high rate increase for the assembly. The assembly is just the tip of the iceberg because in order to meet rates, whatever, 75 or so, if we speak about Airbus, you know, Boeing has also high rates increased as well, and also Comac is willing to increase. We have to look at the global picture, which is encompassing forging, casting, machining, special processes. Once again, the assembly is just the tip of the iceberg.
Christophe Menard
Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst
0:15:29
Thank you very much.
Operator
0:15:33
Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Ben Heelan, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director
0:15:45
Morning, guys. I hope you're well. The first question I had was on aftermarket. Clearly [crosstalk].
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:15:54
Thank you, Ben. You may have noticed it.
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director
0:15:55
Sorry, I'm sorry, Olivier. You do sound quite ill.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:15:58
It's okay.
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director
0:15:58
I hope you get better soon. The third question is on aftermarket, and clearly, very strong trends through the year. Your partner, GE, gave some building blocks for 2026 on their call earlier this week. I was just wondering, are there any building blocks that you can provide? The mix is obviously very similar, but there's also some differences in how we can think about aftermarket growth and any building blocks you can provide at this point into next year. My second question is free cash flow. You've obviously had guidance upgrades pretty much all through the year. They have been quite material.
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director
0:16:39
I think when I look at what you've done in 2024, I look at what you've done in 2025, it's clearly extremely difficult for you to be as low as what you guided at your capital markets day for your 2024-2028 sort of cumulative free cash flow. How are you thinking about the medium-term guidance here? You're clearly running well ahead of it. When can we expect an update there? My final question is, obviously, you've owned Collins Aerospace for a couple of months now. Just any comments in terms of how it's performing, what you see? Now that Collins is done, where's next from an M&A perspective? Or are you broadly happy with the portfolio as it is today? Thank you both.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:17:27
Okay. Good morning, Ben. I guess your first two questions relate to either the 2026 outlook or the 2028 ambition. At this point in time, now our midterm plan is ready. What we need to do is to compile our midterm plan with the Collins contribution. We acquired this company late July. August, as you know, is not a busy month, at least here in France. We need some more time to compile all this data. We'll come back in February, obviously, with the 2025 results, with the guidance for 2026, notably on aftermarket. We'll discuss our first EBIT target for 2028 and our cumulative free cash flow. I would again agree with the comments you made that we are clearly on the upside, notably on aftermarket.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:18:26
I guess we can now say that we share a similar view with GE on the CFM spare parts momentum, CFM56 spare parts momentum that they disclosed mid-July. We need to quantify the impact at Safran level and come back to you next February.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:18:46
Ben, on Collins Aerospace, I can tell you that the teams are enthusiastic. The ex-Collins teams that were Safran in the UK, in France, and in Italy are enthusiastic to join Safran. They are on board our strategy. They are very pleased to see that we have a strategy going forward with respect to flight controls and the preparation for the next single aisle. Our integration team is fully engaged to get in the timeline that we've committed to, the cost synergies that we can draw from the various activities. We have engaged in that. Typically, our team from the nacelle business have started to connect with our new flight control and actuation and flight control teams, same for our landing system teams, same for our aerosystem teams. We are fully engaged. What is next? As we have always said, M&A is opportunistic.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:20:20
To be very clear on the equipment side, I think we have made most of our moves. We have quite our complete spectrum of activities in safety-critical equipment. I don't expect that there's going to be a significant further move on the equipment side. As we said, we stand ready for, let's say, some bolt-on acquisition, especially in defense, which is a strong area of growth.
Benjamin Heelan
Managing Director
0:20:54
Thank you both. I hope you go well.
Pascal Bantegnie

Thank you. Next question is from Chloe Lemarie from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Chloe Lemarie
Equity Research Analyst - Aerospace & Defence
0:21:07
Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I'd have the first one on the LEAP assembly line in Morocco. I was wondering how quickly it would ramp because I was under the impression it would start operation in 2028. I'm wondering how long it would take to reach the 350 engines per year mentioned in the press release. Also, with this announcement, does that mean that you have finalized discussions with Airbus on the ramp-up to rate 75? My second question was actually on seats. We've obviously seen challenges in certification for a while in the industry now. I was wondering if it affected in any way what you see as the potential margin for the business, and in turn, if it affected your view of how core this business is for Safran.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:22:02
Hello, Chloe. On the LEAP assembly line, we said that the first assembled engine would be the beginning of 2028, if I remember well. It's 2028. We will ramp up, let's say. We are not going to reach 350 in a matter of months, for sure, but I expect that the 350 can be reached by 2030 or so. This is for Morocco. Typically, here, our assembly line in Villaroche, in France, will account for about 65% of our, let's say, global assembly capacity. Morocco, plus we have a small, we have a tiny, small assembly capacity in Mexico as well to deliver engines to Mobile, Alabama. Morocco plus Mexico would account for 35%, roughly. Rate 75, we have, let's say, a new line view with Airbus on basically 2026 and 2027. We have engaged in discussion for the rate 75. The discussions are ongoing at the moment.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:23:40
On seats, this is an area where we had many, many challenges. We have tackled the development challenges. Now the development process is really under control. We have addressed the supply chain issues. Here as well, it has improved significantly. This is an area where we probably were a little bit too shy, if I may say, on extracting the value of our seat business. We've significantly improved our price on the, let's say, most recent wins that we have obtained. This will materialize in the EBIT in two years from now. The pricing is obviously a key element of the, let's say, financial recovery of the seat business. We are still facing some certification challenges, which is an industry-wide challenge on certification. That's where we are.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:24:53
Yeah. Good morning, Chloe. Part of your question, is it still a core business? It is. You know we have not changed our mind compared to the view we shared at the Capital Market Day in 2021. We've said that 30% of the former Zodiac activities were non-core. We have already divested some of them. We may divest more in the future. Seats is not part of our divestment process.
Chloe Lemarie

Thank you. Next question is from Ross Law, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ross Law
Executive Director, Equity Research
0:25:34
Hi, everyone. Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just to come back on LEAP rates, you just mentioned that you're aligned with Airbus for rates for 2026 and 2027, but still in discussions for rate 75. Does that mean that rate 75 could only be achieved beyond 2027 from a Safran perspective? Second one on LEAP again, just in terms of the engine catch-up, you previously said you aim to fully catch up by the end of October, so a few days' time. Given this, obviously, strong delivery numbers in the third quarter, is that still on track? Last one, if I may, just on tariffs. You've quantified the number or the impact for 2025 at $100 to $150 million. This, of course, only applies to a portion of the year. Should we extrapolate this run rate into 2026 until a trade deal is finalized? Thanks.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:26:28
Hello, Ross. On your first questions, what can I say? Rate 75 is under discussion. I have not, to my knowledge, I mean, Airbus has not said that rate 75 would be fully reached full year in 2027, to be very clear. There should be no misunderstanding here. Yes, we have, let's say, a joint vision on the number of engines we need for 2026, 2027, and we are discussing now 2028 and going forward. Are we going to catch up this year? I'm confident we will. We had a very strong Q3. I don't see any reason why Q4 should be different than Q3. This is why we have raised our guidance of deliveries of LEAP for the full year. If we continue on this rate of weekly deliveries to Airbus, we will catch up by the end of October, beginning of November, as we said. I am confident in that respect. I will let Pascal answer on the tariff.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:28:11
Yeah. Good morning, Ross. As you said, in 2025, the tariff story was a bit strange because we had no tariff paid in Q1. Starting from April, we had different trades between EU and U.S., China and U.S., and Mexico, Canada, and U.S. Before we had the bilateral agreements being announced and now signed, we were lacking clarity. To answer your question, going forward for 2026 up to 2030, if I may, I would expect, given what we know today, because this may change, this is still a fluid environment, the net impact to be no more than €100 million per year on EBIT. Okay? I would say, yeah, €80 million, €100 million, could be the right range to think of.
Ross Law

Yes, hi. Good morning.
Olivier Andriès

0:29:31
Morning, Ken.
Ken Herbert
Aerospace & Defense Analyst
0:29:34
I wanted to first ask on the CFM56, can you comment on across the network how much improvement you've seen this year in turnaround times for that engine, specifically on the aftermarket, and specifically when you think you might get back to 2018, 2019 pre-pandemic levels in terms of turnaround time? My second question is for the spare parts guidance this year, can you just remind us how much of that is price versus volume versus work scope for the guide on the parts? Thank you.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:30:17
Hello, Ken. Most of the shops today are dealing with CFM56 and LEAP. What is mainly driving the turnaround time are the two following elements. One is the overall maintenance capacity. In fact, on a worldwide basis, especially in the CFM network, we were short of capacity. This is why we are on a significant ramp-up of our maintenance capacity, and the same for our partner GE. That is one. The second key element is basically the availability of parts. Those are the key drivers of the turnaround time. Because the pressure is very high, both on the maintenance capacity and on spare parts, on parts globally because we have to feed the OE side as well as the aftermarket side, the turnaround time is not the same as the one we enjoyed pre-COVID.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:31:36
On the CFM56, talking about Safran at least, our current turnaround time is around 100 days, which is above, let's say, the typical turnaround time we had before COVID, which was closer to 70 days. That is where we are today on CFM56. On LEAP, the turnaround time is higher, but this is, as always, the beginning of the journey on the LEAP. We are on a strong trajectory to decrease the turnaround time on LEAP globally this year compared to last year and will make more progress even next year. Today, the turnaround time on LEAP, let's say, our target is 130 days. Basically, we are on a trajectory to go down to 100 days in the next one or two years.

Okay. Your second question on the spare parts momentum. You know there are three components within our spare parts index: CFM56 engines, LEAP engines, and GE engines. The largest positive surprise we had so far this year is coming from the GE engines. You know that we have a minority stake on all GE engines, and we do benefit from a strong volume and heavier work scope, sorry, than we initially anticipated. That was the first good news so far this year. On LEAP, I would say it's slightly better than we had expected, but not far from our initial expectation. On CFM56, if I break down volume, it's a mid-single-digit growth, as we've said since early this year. On pricing, we both benefit from the price increase we had in August 2024 in the high single-digit range.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:33:44
We also benefit now from the mid to high single-digit range price increase that we had in August 2025. The good news is coming as well from the work scope, which is higher than what we had expected. Altogether, this is why we have consistently and continuously increased our assumption for spare parts, starting the year with high single-digit plus. Now the guidance is mid to high teens. As I said, we are at the end of the first nine months at 19.5%.

Thank you. We'll now take our next question. This is from Sam Burgess, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Sam Burgess
Head of European Aerospace and Defence Equity Research
0:34:37
Good morning, Olivier and Pascal. Thanks for taking the question. There was clearly very strong growth in services over the quarter. I know you can't quantify this exactly, but can you just give us a sense of the overall proportion of LEAP RPFH within the services revenue mix? Broadly, how should we think about margin there across services relative to spare parts? Is lower but improving the right way to frame it? A second question, if I may, is there anything we should be aware of that may put pressure on the implied exit rate margin going into 2026?
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:35:19
Good morning, Sam. On your first question, LEAP RPFH is the vast majority for services revenues. Growth is coming from, you know, as we recognize revenues as per the cost. It means that we have more costs on these contracts, which is no good news. In fact, the reason behind that is that we have a different mix within our LEAP RPFH contracts today. We were performing a lot of what we call quick turns, so you know low-value shop visits. Now, as there are more shop visits in the mix, so performance restoration shop visits in the mix than quick turns compared to what we had anticipated, meaning more cost, meaning more revenue. This is why we upped our assumption to low to mid 20s.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:36:19
By construction, it has no EBIT benefit because we know from the beginning of the year, you know, the value of EBIT we will recognize under our LEAP RPFH contracts. As we have disclosed and discussed at the capital market, we have a profit recognition methodology, which is fixed, whatever the revenue level is. No EBIT contribution from this upgrade in our assumption. What was, sorry, your second question again?
Sam Burgess
Head of European Aerospace and Defence Equity Research
0:36:51
Sorry. The second question was just going into 2026. Is there anything we should be aware of that may put pressure on the implied exit rate margin given your new EBIT guide?
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:37:04
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I got your question, Sam.
Sam Burgess
Head of European Aerospace and Defence Equity Research
0:37:07
Is there anything we should be aware of?
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:37:10
Is your question FX or not? No, it's not that.
Sam Burgess
Head of European Aerospace and Defence Equity Research
0:37:13
No, on margin, whether there's anything that could put pressure on margin going into 2026 that we should be aware of.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:37:21
Okay. You mean globally or on propulsion?
Sam Burgess
Head of European Aerospace and Defence Equity Research
0:37:24
No, in terms of group.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:37:27
We will guide in February for 2026. Our view is that, if I take businesses by businesses, starting maybe with aircraft interiors, our intent is to improve the operating margin by more or less 200 basis points each and every year if we want to be at 10% by 2028, which was what we discussed at the Capital Market Day. In equipment and defense, I would say before Collins because we have still to evaluate the Collins impact. As you know, it will be dilutive in the first years. Before the Collins contribution, our target is to be at 15% in 2028. We were last year at 12.2%. This year, we expect to improve by at least 50 basis points our margin in equipment and defense. We should continue to grow next year. In propulsion, we posted a very strong H1 at, I guess, it was north of 23%.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:38:36
I remember that we say that the margin should improve by more or less 250 basis points this year. I would maybe revise slightly down this expectation given that we have higher services. As you see, we up our assumption, and it comes with no EBIT, as I just said. We will also increase LEAP deliveries, meaning more revenues, but all that is coming at a loss. In propulsion, I would say 200-250 basis points, but maybe on the low side of the range. Going forward, the key point will be on propulsion, and we will discuss that in 2026, a bit early to tell.
Sam Burgess
Head of European Aerospace and Defence Equity Research
0:39:18
Yeah, great. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Operator
0:39:23
Thank you. We'll now take the next question. This is from Olivier Brochet from Rothschild. Please go ahead.
Olivier Brochet
Senior Equity Research Analyst
0:39:35
Yes. Good morning, Olivier. Good morning, Pascal. I would have two questions, please. In the newspapers a few weeks ago, there were discussions about potential disposals that you could be doing in interiors. I don't know if you can comment about that, but if you are doing these disposals, what will you be doing with the cash, please? The second question is on the tariff impacts on free cash flow. If you could give us a sense of how this would play out in 2025, 2026, compared to the impact that you give for operating income, please.
Olivier Andriès
CEO and Director
0:40:15
Hello, Olivier. We will not comment specifically on basically those articles and those remarks. I will only reiterate what we've said back in 2021. At our Capital Market Day in 2024, we intend to sell and dispose about 30% of the ex-Zodiac portfolio. The majority of this perimeter is going to relate to interiors, the majority. We've also said that we wish, we want to recover, let's say, the performance, the operational and financial performance of those activities before starting a process of disposal. We are on that path.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:41:27
Morning, Olivier. On your question, it's a good question on the free cash associated with tariffs. On the EBIT side, as I said, there's a net impact of a negative €100 million-€150 million in 2025. The cash impact is higher than that for two very simple reasons. First, we have put in place what we call a duty drawback mechanism by which, if you apply, you can get your cash back in some circumstances, but it will take time from the CBP to reimburse you. Part of what we see in EBIT in 2025 will be cash back only in 2026 and so on. As you know, part of the mitigation actions is to take commercial actions with customers, meaning invoicing customers for the tariff surplus. Here again, there is a cycle for cash collection from our customers. You would assume that the cash impact in 2025 is higher than the EBIT impact that we have disclosed.
Olivier Brochet
Senior Equity Research Analyst
0:42:31
That's helpful. Thank you. If I can go back on the disposals, my point was not so much whether you will do them or not. It was more on the use of the cash. Is this something that shareholders should think of as reinvested in the business, reinvested in external growth, or effectively as shareholder distribution?
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:42:57
It depends on the size of the disposal. If we are talking of a few hundred million euros or if we are talking of more than a billion euros, depending on what we can achieve or not. At this point in time, I guess we have a friendly approach to shareholders in terms of dividend and share buyback. We need to execute on that. On M&A, as Olivier said before, you know it is always opportunistic because we don't know what kind of companies will come for sale. We will see with time. We will consider what will be the cash use once we have finalized the divestment.
Olivier Brochet
Senior Equity Research Analyst
0:43:41
Thank you very much. That's helpful.
Operator
0:43:44
Thank you. We have one more question. This is from Ian Douglas-Pennant from UBS. Please go ahead.
Ian Douglas-Pennant
Aerospace and Defence Analyst
0:43:55
Thanks, sir. Thanks for taking my question. Yes, Ian at UBS. Firstly, just a quick one on currency. Could you just remind us of the translational impact here? Your guidance assumes $1.10, and we're obviously a little off that point today. I know you hedge, but what's the translational impacts, please? Secondly, could you help us understand, are you still expecting a kind of fade in the market environment that you're seeing in Q4, which results in weaker revenue growth and weaker profit growth in Q4 as implied in your guidance? Could you just help us understand what the kind of offsets are there, please? Thank you.
Pascal Bantegnie
CFO
0:44:41
Okay. Good morning, Ian. On your first question, to provide clarity on the translation effect. First, in terms of sensitivity, €0.01 of FX change has more or less €150 million of impact on revenues either way. We built our initial guidance at 1.10. What matters is the average spot rate over the full year. Year to date, despite the fact that we went up to 1.17, even 1.18 at some point in time, on average, year to date, it's 1.12. If we assume that Q4 will remain at 1.16 for the full quarter, you would assume that the full-year average spot rate will be more or less at 1.13. Okay? It's €0.03 different from our initial expectation, which means no more than €0.5 billion of a negative impact on the full-year sales. On your Q4 question, lower growth than what we had in the first nine months, but it's simply because of the comparison base, which was quite high last year. I don't see anything specific other than that.

Thank you, Daniella. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to announce another set of quarterly results with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenues, backlog, and EPS. Quarterly free cash flow was solid at $101 million, underscoring our healthy cash generation. I will now highlight and discuss some of the key figures and trends in our financial results this quarter. Third Quarter 2025 revenues were $1,922 million compared to $1,718 million in the Third Quarter of 2024, a solid 12% growth in quarterly revenues year-over-year and 18% growth for the nine months ended 30th September. In the Third Quarter 2025, Europe contributed 28%, North America 21%, Asia-Pacific 14%, and Israel were 33% of revenues. GAAP gross margin in the Third Quarter was 24.9% of revenues compared to 24% in the Third Quarter of 2024.
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:03:16
The non-GAAP gross margin for the Third Quarter was 25.2% of revenues compared to 24.4% in the Third Quarter of 2024. GAAP operating income for the Third Quarter was $171.4 million, or 8.9% of revenues, versus $125.8 million, or 7.3% of revenues, in the Third Quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP operating income was $186.7 million, or 9.7% of revenues, compared with $140.7 million, or 8.2% of revenues, in the Third Quarter of last year. We are very pleased with this margin expansion trajectory. The operating expense breakdown in the Third Quarter was as follows: Net R&D expense was $129.1 million, or 6.7% of revenues, compared to $119.9 million, or 7% of revenues, in the Third Quarter of 2024. Elbit continues to invest in R&D to secure future profitable growth, which will maintain Elbit's position as a market leader in years to come.
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:04:46
Marketing and selling expenses were $91 million, or 4.7% of revenues, versus $91.3 million, or 5.3%, in the Third Quarter of 2024. G&A expenses were $86.7 million, or 4.5% of revenues, compared to $75.7 million, or 4.4% of revenues, in the Third Quarter of 2024. Financial expenses were $34.5 million in the Third Quarter, compared to $45 million in the Third Quarter of 2024. The decrease in financial expenses net in the Third Quarter of 2025 was mainly due to a reduction in the average net debt. We recorded a tax expense of $11.4 million in the Third Quarter, compared to $12.8 million in the Third Quarter of 2024. The effective tax rate in the Third Quarter of 2025 was 8.2%, compared to 14.6% in the Third Quarter of 2024.
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:06:06
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the Third Quarter of 2025 was mainly due to the increase in deferred tax assets. GAAP diluted EPS was $2.80 for the Third Quarter of 2025, compared to $1.77 in the Third Quarter of 2024. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS was $3.35 for the Third Quarter of 2025, compared to $2.21 in the Third Quarter of 2024. Quarterly segment revenue for the Third Quarter of 2025: Aerospace. Third Quarter revenues decreased by 3% year-over-year, mainly due to a decrease in precision-guided munitions sales in Asia-Pacific, partially offset by the increase in PGM sales in Israel and an increase in unmanned aerial system sales in Europe. Revenues for the nine months were up 9%. SIFRAE and CYBER. Revenues increased by 14% year-over-year, mainly due to radio systems and command-and-control system sales in Europe. For the nine months, revenue rose by 15%. Astar NEW.
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:07:31
Revenues increased by 5% in the third quarter of 2025, mainly due to electro-optic systems and electronic warfare system sales in Israel and high-power laser sales in Israel. For the nine months, revenue increased by 8%. Land. Revenue increased by 41% in the third quarter of 2025 due to ammunition and munitions sales in Israel and in Europe. For the nine months, revenues were up 44%. Elbit Systems of America. Revenues decreased by 2% due to a decrease in electronic systems and medical instrument sales, partially offset by the increase in maritime and warfighter system sales. For the nine months, revenue rose 6%. The order backlog as of September 30, 2025, was $25.2 billion, $3.1 billion higher than the backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2024 and $1.4 billion higher than the backlog in the second quarter of 2025.
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:08:42
The increase in backlog during the quarter came mainly from new European orders. Approximately 69% of the current backlog is derived from orders outside of Israel. Approximately 38% of the current backlog is scheduled to be performed during the remainder of 2025 and during 2026, and the rest is scheduled for 2027 and beyond. Cash flow provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was $461 million as compared to $82.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The cash flow in the nine months ended September 30, 2025, was affected mainly by the strong increase in net income. On the back of the continued strength of the company's result, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to be paid on January 5, 2026. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Machlis, Elbit CEO. Butzi, please go ahead.

Thank you, Kobe. Hello, everyone, and thank you once again for joining us today. As Kobe just described, these results continue the growth and margin expansion trajectory driven by strong demand for our solutions, particularly in Europe and Israel. Elbit's seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth further demonstrates our global leadership on the modern battlefield. Our recently tested and proven solutions position us as a leading authority in our rapidly changing industry as defense budgets continue to rise globally and our customers seek cutting-edge battle-proven systems to secure and protect their population. Our portfolio of ever-relevant technologies supports our customers' pursuit of advanced warfighter solutions across all domains. On the back of the strong results, I am proud that we continue to improve the translation of our revenue growth to growth in both profit and cash flow.
Bezhalel Machlis
CEO
0:11:10
This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we delivered positive free cash flow and improved the company's cash conversions. Yesterday, we announced the signing of an international contract for a strategic solution for approximately $2.3 billion. This contract will be performed over a period of eight years. I am extremely pleased with this announcement of the largest contract in Elbit's history. Further testament to the superiority of our product and technologies, we will continue to equip our customers with advanced and relevant solutions. During the quarter, Elbit received another large contract to supply a European country with a range of our solutions totaling $1.625 billion to be delivered over the next five years. The contract includes long-range precision-strike artillery rocket systems and a broad spectrum of unmanned reconnaissance and loitering air combat systems.
Bezhalel Machlis
CEO
0:12:26
Highly sophisticated ISTAR capabilities, including SIGINT, COMINT, and electronic warfare systems, enabled intelligence collection and processing systems, will also be delivered along with advanced electro-optics and night vision systems, combat vehicle upgrades, and protective systems. New orders also included a contract for our Hermes 900 drones, advanced airborne munitions for the Israel Ministry of Defense, and a $260 million contract for DIRCOM systems to Airbus. Following the 12-day campaign against Iran, Elbit has seen growing interest in our solutions, mainly though not exclusively for the Hermes drones, EW systems, and training platforms. The Hermes platforms enable us to cross-sell products from other segments and offer our customers comprehensive solutions. Since its first order in 2011, the Hermes 900 has been selected by over 20 customers worldwide.

In August, we successfully launched the advanced Jupiter space camera aboard the National Advanced Optical System satellite, supporting a wide span of Earth observation missions, including military operations, environmental monitoring, and scientific research. Developed by Elbit Systems ISTAR and EW, Jupiter is one of the world's most advanced space cameras, featuring a very large aperture and an exceptionally lightweight design. The camera is multispectral, offering a combination of imaging channels. During the quarter, we expanded our operations in Europe, opening new facilities in Sweden and Germany to enhance our local delivery capabilities to ensure more secure, faster support to our customers. Being close to our customers is crucial for us. Our enhanced presence in Europe strengthens our ability to deliver modern and reliable solutions at the pace required to ensure the armed forces' capability to defend Europe from its offenders.

In June, we launched PAUS-2, a next-generation infrared missile warning system for fighter aircraft designed to enhance their survivability and operational effectiveness. The system detects a wide range of threats, regardless of seeker type, and provides advanced protection for fighter jets, transport aircraft, and helicopters operating in complex, high-threat environments. At BSAI, we unveiled Frontier, a cutting-edge wide-area persistent surveillance system designed to address the increasing complexity and intensity of border protection challenges. Frontier autonomously operates multiple types of sensors to visually confirm and classify threats, transmitting only the most relevant analyzed information to the appropriate forces. It leverages advanced artificial intelligence to optimize intelligence gathering and decision-making across land, air, and maritime domains. All these notable achievements would not have been possible without our dedicated employees, whose day-and-night commitment to Elbit is truly unique.

Your question about the domestic demand, we can look at this quarter. We had an increase of $1.4 billion in our backlog, $200 million in Israel, and $1.2 billion outside of Israel. We are looking at that as some kind of the nature of the growth of the backlog for the future. We are targeting around a flattish backlog in Israel and growth outside of Israel, predominantly in Europe. That will be the growth area which we see our funnel, we see our opportunities, and we see the demand that's coming out from Europe. We think that this is the place that predominantly will provide the growth in the future in the backlog.

Hi, it's Butzi. Hello. Good morning, I believe. I believe that we'll continue to see growth in this segment as well. First, I would like to mention that our drone mix is embedded on top of most of the Western platforms. It includes our helmet, but not only that. Also, quite a lot of other equipment from us is embedded in many, many platforms in many, many countries, not just in the U.S. We enjoy revenues coming from international sales of Boeing and Lockheed and other OEMs of all the platforms abroad. I really feel that this market, I really believe that this market will continue to grow for us. I would like also to mention UAVs. There is a huge demand for UAVs, for loitering munitions. We have 20 international customers who bought till now the Hermes 900 from us.
Bezhalel Machlis
CEO
0:20:49
We provide not just a platform. We provide an integrated solution which includes all our sensors and payloads from the company. We have a very unique offering to our customers. I see a growing market for UAVs, for main UAVs, but also for small UAVs and for loitering munitions, which are all under the airborne segment. I believe that this segment will continue to grow for the company in Israel and mainly abroad.
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:21:23
Seth, this is Kobe to further add on Butzi's answer. If you look at the three quarters over three quarters last year, the aerospace segment grew 9%. We think that the relevant growth number for the aerospace is a single-digit growth in revenues because this segment is leaning predominantly on the U.S. budget, with a lot of revenue coming from the U.S., which is a single-digit budget growth. For that reason, that is the number that we think is relevant for this quarter, for this segment.
Seth Seifman
Analyst
0:22:09
Okay. Excellent. Excellent. Thanks. If I could add one follow-up question, can you talk a little bit more about the opportunities that are emerging in directed energy? We've seen some of the progress on Iron Beam. Are you seeing a lot of opportunities emerge for directed energy solutions outside of Israel as well?
Bezhalel Machlis
CEO
0:22:34
Yeah. The answer is yes. As you know, we are part of the Israeli program for ground high-powered systems. The laser source is coming from us, and the first system should be deployed by the end of this year, the Iron Beam system. There is going to be, I believe, that next year we'll see many more orders here in Israel for ground high-powered lasers. Based on the success here in Israel, there is a lot of interest in many other places for high-powered lasers and for ground high-powered laser systems. We are part of this solution. Here in Israel, we lead the airborne high-powered laser system. It's still in the development phase. I believe that there is a very big potential for us for this system.
Bezhalel Machlis
CEO
0:23:37
I think that high-powered lasers in the air will be a game changer in the way countries are fighting against drones and against swarms and against cruise missiles. This is still under development, although it's still in development, there is a lot of interest for that for many, many customers abroad. We are not developing just high-powered lasers. We have other types of energy weapons which are in a very advanced phase of development, which some of them are confidential, but I can tell you that they are very unique. We really believe that this energy weapon activity is a very important growth engine for Elbit for the future.

The next question is from Ellen Page of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ellen Page
Analyst
0:24:49
Hi, guys. Thank you for the question. Just the margin was very strong in the quarter on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Can you discuss the drivers of that, and was there any element of mix that supported profitability in the quarter, and how do we think about the progression of margins from here?
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:25:11
Hi, Ellen. How are you? If you notice, there is a very strong expansion in margins this quarter, as you indicated, which comes as a 0.9% improvement, a 1%, shy of 1% in the gross profitability of the company, and additional 0.5% on the operational expenses. We are looking at a 1% expansion in the gross profitability and 1.5% expansion in the operational profitability. Those two are the fruits of improvement in our backlog profitability and for using a lot of operational excellence, both investments and also processes that were inaugurated in the company, including using AI for different purposes of operational use. That is driving not just our operational profitability, but also our gross profitability up. This is the first quarter that we see this kind of expansion in both the gross profitability and the operational profitability.
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:26:34
On top of that, we are also doing CapEx investments, which are yielding fruits, as we discussed many times in the past, the ERP system that is fully operational, the one ERP system that is fully operational in the company, and also robots and cobots that we are also using now mainly in the ammunition and munition factories. If I can summarize everything, we can see that we have our advantages to the size, which with the increase in revenue, we are doing better conversion to profits.
Ellen Page
Analyst
0:27:18
Great. That's very helpful. How do we think about the impact of last operational disruptions, assuming the ceasefire holds? Is that an opportunity for another step up from here?
Ellen Page
Analyst
0:27:38
We are very happy. We're very happy with the ceasefire, of course, and that we prayed, everybody here prayed for that after two years of this conflict. We all hope that this quiet will be maintained here in Israel. Of course, for the company, it allows us to regroup, people to come back from mobilization, and to get back to normal business, which is, as you know, Elbit is mainly predominantly working outside of Israel. This is our strength of doing around 70% of the business outside of Israel. It allows us to invest more in the business outside of Israel and to focus, of course, more about doing the ordinary business as we did before this 7th of October conflict. Of course, this is an opportunity for the company to receive more opportunities and more new business to strengthen our backlog.

0:29:01
Thank you, operator. We have a couple of questions from Chen Kerrit from Excellence. Chen, thank you very much for your questions today. The first one is, has there been any update to the company's profitability target for 2026, 10% operating profit, following the expansion of the order backlog and the improvement in gross margins in the current quarter?
Kobi Kagan
CFO
0:29:24
Thank you, Daniella and Chen. As you know, we're not giving specifically targets and providing guidance. Saying that, we will still maintain our internal targets to continue to improve our profitability. This is, of course, a strong target in the company, as well as cash conversion, which is a principal target in the company to continue the improvement in cash conversion in the company.
Daniella Finn
VP of Investor Relations
0:29:58
Thank you, Kobe. The second question from Chen is, how does Elbit plan to generate added value from the significant expansion in the US DOD's budget? Specifically, is there a concrete plan to pursue an M&A transaction in the US and/or to expand into verticals such as drone swarms or border protection applications?
Bezhalel Machlis
CEO
0:30:23
Thank you. Thank you, Daniella and Chen. The US market is very strategic to Elbit. We see the US as our home market. I'm very pleased with our performance in the US. The last two acquisitions we made, the Night Vision activity and Sparton, the Sonoboy activity, both of them are very successful. Both of them are growing. We certainly look for opportunities for acquisitions in the US. We're exploring the market. I would like to say that in the past, we delivered a system to the CBP for border protection. Our equipment is deployed along the borders. We believe that the current need for additional systems along the borders is very relevant to us, and we are planning to pursue it. The rest of our activities in the US are very successful as well.
Bezhalel Machlis
CEO
0:31:34
Our avionics activities are growing, and our active protection system is doing very well in the U.S. on top of the Bradley flight tank. We will continue to invest in the U.S. We will continue to recruit additional people. We would like to expand our position in this very important market for Elbit.

Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:00:37
Good evening to all of you. Welcome to Kering 2025 third quarter revenue call. I will start with comments on the period, and we'll be joined by Jean-Marc Duplaix, our COO, for some concluding remarks before we take your questions. Starting on slide four, the quarter ended with a series of bangs in the form of highly rated fashion shows and presentations with three debut collections at our four main brands. At Gucci, Demna's La Familia collection and its presentation through a short movie, Tiger, stand out as a bold creative statement. Reimagining Gucci's codes through a modern-day prism, the collection reflects the varied facets of Gucci's personality incarnated by A-list performers. At Bottega Veneta, Matthieu Blazy's inaugural collection opened a new chapter, overlaying a confident vision to the house's artisanal heritage. A subtle reinterpretation of the intrecciato motif and other house codes resonated strongly with audiences.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:01:46
Demna gave the fashion world a refined version of Balenciaga, balancing couture craftsmanship with modern designs and accessories. Last but not least, Saint Laurent staged another powerful show set against the Eiffel Tower. The collection reaffirmed the brand's core identity and showcased a fresh dimension through spectacular silhouettes and innovative materials. All four collections drew wide acclaim and attention, boding well for their rollout in H1 2026. Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga were among the most viewed runway shows with significantly higher livestream and replay views versus last year. Gucci, despite not presenting a runway show, achieved exceptional media visibility and generated record engagement and positive reaction across digital platforms. On slide five, you will find the key figures for the third quarter. Revenue was down 10% reported and 5% comparable, with a significant five-point negative FX impact.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:02:58
The 5% comparable revenue drop comes after a 15% decline in Q2. Of this sequential 10 percentage point improvement, only about half of it is attributable to the easier comps. Looking at retail dynamics, all regions contributed to the sequential improvement. North America and Western Europe posted the best underlying momentum. In terms of KPIs, the drag from traffic moderated with some regions doing better than others. Continued increase in AUR, driven by mix, as well as higher average tickets, provided some buffer to the drop in volume. I would also like to mention that full-price stores performed best, our brand continuing to gradually reduce their outlet footprint and assortment. Online revenue, for their part, started to stabilize. On slide six, you have Q3 revenue by segment. All our segments improved sequentially compared to Q2.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:04:01
In terms of magnitude, Gucci and the other houses posted the best improvements, although starting from a lower point. Bottega Veneta confirmed its positive momentum on a high convex. Saint Laurent's performance started to recover. The improvement in eyewear and corporate reflects an acceleration at Kering Eyewear. Our Q3 revenue breakdown by region evolved from 2024. As a percentage of the mix, Asia-Pacific dropped 2 points and Japan 1 point. The rest of the world was stable, while Western Europe and North America gained 1 and 2 points, respectively. On slide seven, let's move to the Q3 top line by channel. Retail, accounting for 74% of revenue, was then 6% comparable, a significant quarter-on-quarter improvement. Our footprint at 1,758 stores showed a net decrease of 55 units since year-end, of which 14 net in Q3. This excludes Creed integration of its China distribution back in Q2.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:05:12
Gucci was the largest contributor to our network optimization plan, with a net decline of 8 units in the quarter and 26 over the first 9 months. As you know, our strategy concentrates on fewer but higher-quality locations. It also entails gradually downsizing our presence in outlets with 2 additional closures in Q3. Wholesale and other revenue, accounting for 20% of the total, was then 2% comparable. Wholesale revenue at our luxury houses dropped 11% in Q3, primarily due to the strategic downsizing of this channel and softer order intake. While these factors continue to weigh on performance, their impact is progressively moderating. In absolute terms, wholesale dropped more than €330 million year to date. We are in line with our planned trajectory for the year that implied a minor decrease in H2.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:06:13
We are comfortable with our current wholesale setup and number of doors and do not expect any material impact from rationalization in 2026. This decline was partly offset by growth in wholesale at Kering Eyewear and Beauté, up 5% comparable, and by a 1% increase in royalties and other revenue. On slide eight, a closer look at comparable retail performance by region. Overall, it continued to be affected by soft tourism spending, while domestic consumption demonstrated greater resilience. In Western Europe, Q3 improved sequentially, down 7%. Local demand, accounting for 40% of the total, was the key driver. Tourism spending also improved from Q2, but to a lesser extent. North America turned positive, up 3% from a 10% decline in Q2. Sequential improvement occurred across the board, with Saint Laurent and Balenciaga back to growth, Bottega Veneta confirming its strong momentum, and Gucci's drop now just 3%.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:07:25
Looking at the American cluster, it was nearly flat in Q3, marking a notable improvement over Q2, although a bit less than the region. Japan, down 17% comparable in Q3, improved on the back of easier comps, but was still the region most impacted by weaker tourism spending, while local consumption proved a touch better than in Q2. Asia-Pacific declined 10% comparable in Q3, a 9-point sequential improvement. Better trends in the region were driven by mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, but also Korea. However, the overall improvement is in line with the easier comparison base. The Chinese cluster was then high ten, substantially better than in Q2 and H1. In the quarter, more than 30% of spending by Chinese customers took place outside of their home market, and close to 80% of their overseas spending remained in Asia, including Japan.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:08:28
Finally, the rest of the world swung back to growth, up 2% comparable in Q3. Moving to our houses, starting with Gucci on slide nine. Q3 revenue was close to €1.35 billion, down 18% reported and 14% comparable. Retail was then 13%, 10 percentage points better than Q2, driven by North America and Western Europe. AUR was up across categories, mainly through mix, supported by newness introduction in handbags, and average tickets also increased, partially offsetting a milder drop in traffic. Leather goods started their recovery. The injection of novelties, initiated last year and accelerating since, has begun to pay off, particularly in handbags, where we are seeing promising early signs of stabilization. This rejuvenation should gradually strengthen Gucci's carryover base.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:09:32
From the emblem line to strategic revamps of Marmont and Ophelia, and the highly successful launch of Giulio in May, alongside mini GiGi and recent introductions such as Beatrix and Sienna, Gucci's product offering has been significantly strengthened, enhanced in terms of quality, and rejuvenated across all price points. With the La Familia presentation in late September, Gucci has started regaining its fashion authority, reaching a broader audience, including younger customers, and refreshing existing relationships, notably with top clients. As you know, the looks were available only in 10 stores for two weeks, so this will not change our revenue profile in Q4. Women's and men's ready-to-wear accounted for the bulk of the sales. La Familia also supports traffic in stores and cross-selling opportunities for the fall-winter lineup. The full Familia collection will hit the whole network from January onward. Wholesale was then 25% in the quarter.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:10:41
Turning to slide 10, Saint Laurent. Saint Laurent Q3 revenue was €620 million, down 7% reported and 4% comparable. Retail was then 2% comparable, but was up, excluding outlets. North America turned positive, and Western Europe was only down 3%. The house confirmed its high desirability, and new collections were very well received, with both ready-to-wear and shoes up double digits. In leather goods, the revitalization of key lines, such as Lulu, and recent additions to Icar are yielding solid results. The acceleration in innovation and the fine-tuning of the product architecture are firmly on track. Wholesale was then 16% in the quarter, unfazed and further impact from rationalization. On slide 11, Bottega Veneta's revenue came close to €400 million, down 1% reported but up 3% comparable.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:11:45
Retail remained a key driver, up 5% comparable, supported by sustained double-digit growth in North America, despite high comps, and positive trends in Western Europe and the Middle East. Asia-Pacific was nearly unchanged, and Japan was moderately down. Growth was fueled by locals and high-end clients, as well as a continued AUR increase. Ready-to-wear and shoes were the fastest-growing categories, and the launch of the Campana handbag delivered promising results. The value strategy, combined with strong cultural content and an efficient mix of global and local communication campaigns, continued to reinforce the brand's positioning. The acclaimed debut show of Bottega Veneta's new creative director paved the way for a next stage of progress at the house. Wholesale declined 9% on a comparable basis, fully in line with the selective distribution strategy. Our other houses here on slide 12 had revenues of over €650 million on a comparable basis.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:12:57
They were up 1%, with retail unchanged and wholesale up 5%. In soft luxury, our houses also delivered sequential improvements. Balenciaga sharply reduced the gap with last year, thanks notably to positive sales growth in North America, but all regions and product categories did better. Compared to Q2, Alexander McQueen reduced its year-on-year shortfall, with sales of women's ready-to-wear up and a reinforced handbag lineup. Brioni sales were up, boosted by solid double-digit retail increases in key regions. Jewelry was a particularly bright spot this quarter, up double digits. Boucheron's expansion in the U.S. continued to pay off, and the house posted positive retail and wholesale performances in other regions as well. Pomellato also had an excellent quarter, helped by retail up in most regions, with strong showings of Kilo lines and the new high jewelry collection.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:14:04
Dodo recorded another solid performance, and Qeelin achieved impressive growth rates across Asian markets. On slide 13, a focus on Kering Eyewear and corporate, with segment revenues of nearly €450 million. At Kering Eyewear, comparable sales were up 7%. All regions, apart from Japan, turned in positive results, with particularly good performances from Maui Jim and Lindberg, as well as Cartier. The expansion of the portfolio continued thanks to the contract with Valentino, which will lead to a first collection of solar and prescription frames for spring/summer next year. At Kering Beauté, Creed's quarter primarily reflects differences in the calendar of product launches. The new Oud Zion fragrance reached the network in early September and is well received. The other highlight of the quarter was the introduction of the Balenciaga collection of 10 high-perfumery women's fragrances that recorded a hefty sell-out level.
Armelle Poulou
CFO
0:15:14
This wraps up my comments on the quarter, and I will turn the phone over to Jean-Marc for a few words of conclusion.
Jean-François Palus
Interim CEO
0:15:21
Thank you, Armelle. Hello to everyone on the call. As you have seen, the third quarter has been quite an interesting period, during which we started seeing positive signs of inflection. Some were helped by easy comps, others clearly reflect early impacts of our actions. Numbers are one thing. Another, the acceleration of our initiatives to regain our footing and more broadly set our strategic priorities for the coming years. On that front, we have not been sitting on our hands. Luca's arrival has re-energized the organization. He has met with dozens of managers across the group and across regions. We are all working together on developing our strategic plan for the next years. As you know, we should unveil it in the spring of 2026.
Jean-François Palus
Interim CEO
0:16:20
I don't think I will be spoiling the announcement of that plan when I tell you that our number one priority is to reignite the top line. From that standpoint, the progress we made this quarter is encouraging, as is the response to the collections and launches that Armelle mentioned. Clearly, work on the product offer of all our houses ranks high among our strategic priorities. On top of that, as we told you we would, last February or last July, we are accelerating and amplifying our cost and efficiency initiatives. We are further right-sizing the store network and focusing on durably improving sales density. We are enhancing the productivity of our marketing investments, and we are using every available lever to reduce our cost base. Solid progress has been made on all these fronts, and we are keeping the pace.
Jean-François Palus
Interim CEO
0:17:23
We also concentrate on cash generation, and we have launched a group-wide task force headed by Armelle to sustainably optimize inventory and working cap management. Our task is to implement structural solutions to the group's challenges and reduce our sensitivity to cycles. In this endeavor, there are no secret codes. We are assessing every aspect of our houses, from brand positioning to client excellence, as well as the role the group should play in such areas as supply chain, sales through optimization, or customer relationship management. Speed is of the essence, but we are also fully aware that some of these actions will take longer than others. In the meantime, as you have also seen, we have been able to deliver on some key strategic initiatives. The announcements we made on Sunday to join forces with L'Oréal to boost the beauty potential of our houses represent a major step forward.
Jean-François Palus
Interim CEO
0:18:37
This alliance with a global industry leader, a firm with which we share values and have a long-standing working relationship, secures the growth of our brands into beauty at an attractive valuation. As part of the alliance, Creed also gets to integrate into a bigger portfolio, demonstrating the unique attributes of this house and ensuring its next stages of growth. Finally, our plan, joint venture with L'Oréal in luxury longevity and wellness, enables us to combine our strengths in an area that is sure to reach new milestones in the coming years. The deal with L'Oréal will also have a highly positive impact on reducing our debt leverage and other top priorities. Pushing back by two full years, the exercise of the put option for the remaining 70% of Valentino enables us to focus on our existing activities at a time when they require our full attention.
Jean-François Palus
Interim CEO
0:19:43
We are continuing to explore real estate transactions along the lines of what we have already done. As in any negotiation, it would be premature to put a date on them, but we are absolutely confident in reaching a favorable outcome sooner rather than later. A lot has already been done. We will not stop here. We are looking forward to the coming months and to sharing our progress with you. Before we take your questions, I have an important announcement to make. This conference call, number 48, is the last one under Claire Roblet's guidance, as she will soon be taking new responsibilities within the group. Claire's successor will be announced shortly and will be joining us in the coming weeks. I wish to take this occasion to give Claire a warm thank you for the 12 years she has spent leading Kering's financial communications.
Jean-François Palus
Interim CEO
0:20:43
She has done a spectacular job in good and in less good times. We intend to maintain the very high standards she has helped establish and to continue earning the trust of the financial community. Claire, thank you from the bottom of my heart. On that note, we are ready to take your questions. Operator?

Chiara Battistini
Analyst
0:21:51
Hello. Good evening. Thank you very much for the presentation, and thank you very much from my side to Claire for all the work together over the years. First question, maybe on North America, there was a particularly strong read across the board, not just for one single brand. Can you give us more color? Can you talk a bit more about what you've seen with the American consumer throughout the quarter between trust and conversion, and also whether you're seeing new consumers coming, young Americans and maybe aspirational consumers coming back, or rather the high net worth individuals and returning customers across the different brands?
Chiara Battistini
Analyst
0:22:31
The second question on the beauty transaction, I was wondering, are you now happy with the initiatives you've put in place between beauty and real estate in terms of addressing liquidity constraints on the balance sheet, or are you sort of revisiting all options, including potentially other brands in the portfolio? With this beauty transaction and the cash inflow, should we be thinking about possibly also the urge of cost savings, easing to stabilize profitability and availability of cash, or cost savings also remain a key focus at the moment? Thank you.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:23:21
Thank you, Chiara. On North America, we had a sequential improvement that occurred across the board, much beyond the compares. Happy to see Saint Laurent and Balenciaga back to growth, and Bottega Veneta confirming a very strong momentum in the region. In terms of consumer, traffic is improving, but the growth is also helped by the fact that the AUR is going up through mix. In terms of customers, I would say still a good resilience of the high-end customer, but also maybe some good performance on the e-commerce that is generally a channel where we see more aspirational customers.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:24:13
Regarding your question about the beauty transaction and its implications about what we're going to do with the portfolio and the leverage, first of all, I think, and I'm sure that there will be some other questions during the conference about the transaction, but the rationale behind the transaction was not driven by the leveraging ambition that we had. I think it was, at the end of the day, a very win-win deal in the sense that it first fulfilled completely our strategic objectives, as well as the ones of L'Oréal. Of course, it does contribute massively to decrease the debt of the group.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:24:58
That being said, we had started the process of optimizing the structure of our balance sheet that we will not give up in the sense that, as I said, we continue to work on the refinancing of the real estate, which was something already as an ambition when we bought the assets two years ago. Nothing's changed on that side. When it comes to the portfolio, I want to be very clear. We'll review, of course, in a very open manner, as we always did, the relevance of the assets we have in the portfolio. I want to be clear that when it comes to Kering Eyewear, because I read some articles on that, Kering Eyewear is a core in the strategy of Kering, is doing extremely well, is the leader on its segment. You can see that the performance in Q3 was more than robust.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:25:59
We are very pleased with the investments we have in Kering Eyewear, which is instrumental in the development of the group. Beyond the portfolio, when it comes to the savings, we are working on with, under the helm of Armelle, who is doing a brilliant job on that front. To be honest, as I said, we keep the pace because the idea is not to cut the muscle or to touch the muscle, but it's really to be sure that what we are doing and where we are investing, it's always bringing results and return. There is no reason to stop there. I think it's really a good window for us in this period for the industry and for the group to continue this work of streamlining the organization to chase for the maximum of efficiency.

Good evening, Armelle and Jean-Marc. Congratulations, obviously, for this very encouraging development. Jean-Marc, I just wanted to echo your comments on Claire. A huge thank you, Claire, for your time, your patience, and your professionalism. You will definitely be missed. Armelle, if you could please come back on the, it looks like, but maybe I'm wrong, that there was some gradual improvement during the quarter in terms of the trends. If you could comment on that in terms of September and what you've seen so far in Q4 in the Golden Week, that would be question number one. Sorry, just to come back on the sale of the beauty unit to L'Oréal, just to talk numbers to the extent you will be willing to share any.
Ed Aubin
Analyst
0:27:54
I think some of the players have indicated that the cosmetic sales of Saint Laurent is about €3 billion versus Gucci at about €500 million. It looks like there is a really huge opportunity there to grow the business. When you look at that, should we be aware of any fundamental structural reason why Gucci in the medium to long-term cosmetics business should not be more or less the same size? Obviously, Saint Laurent has a bit more heritage there in terms of perfume and cosmetics, but that would be one. The last one, which is quite important and maybe the most sensitive, is for the investors to judge about the merit of the transaction. Obviously, it would be helpful to understand what type of royalty fees are going to be paid by L'Oréal. I think the industry norm is about high single digit to maybe sometimes 10% of sales.
Ed Aubin
Analyst
0:28:47
Again, I don't know what you're going to be willing to share, but if you can just give us a little bit more color in terms of the structure of the deal. I understand that Saint Laurent, the fees are substantially lower than that today that you're getting from L'Oréal. Any comments would be much appreciated. Thank you so much.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:29:06
September performance was in line with the quarter. July was weaker, but it was a month with the first conveys. August was the best month, and then September was in line with the average of the quarter. You know, in terms of current trading, it's very early in the quarter. I'd like also to remind you that the conveys in Q4 is much sharper than in Q3. That being said, retail trends in key regions are in line with Q3, but be mindful that October shows the easiest comparison base in the quarter.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:29:51
When it comes to the size or the potential size of the beauty business for our brands, this business should encompass, at the end of the day, if you look long-term, fragrances, makeup, and to a certain point, the more mature the brand is, skincare. Of course, I cannot disclose any figure. I think that maybe you got some figures from L'Oréal management. It's true that we consider that if you look at the profile of the luxury brand, I would say that we know that the beauty category, if we think in terms of retail price or penetration of the market, should be higher than the one we have currently or that we had historically for Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:30:48
That's the reason why we decided to repatriate these brands and to internalize the business with the success we know because, you know, you may remember that we had very successful launches and we are very pleased with what has been done so far by Kering Beauté. We can imagine also that Gucci brand would deserve, let's say, a higher penetration on that segment, especially if you look at the ranking of the fragrances in different geographies. I think we need to develop more of this business across the board for our brands and that's the rationale behind the transaction with L'Oréal. For sure, I think all the brands, relative to their respective size, have the potential to grow quite massively, with, of course, an incremental level of royalties for us.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:31:42
It does make the transition with your last question, on which, of course, you can imagine I will disappoint you. As we always did with Coty, being very careful about not disclosing any contractual obligations, we will not disclose what is the content of the contract we signed with L'Oréal.

Oliver Chen

0:32:17
Thanks a lot. Claire, it's been really wonderful to work with you as well. Congrats on the next steps. Thanks, Armelle and Jean-Marc. We appreciate it. I'd love, one, you mentioned early signs in handbags and also carryover. What are the early signs you're seeing? Can you accelerate the flow? You've done that in the past in terms of working very quickly there. My second question is on traffic. Is traffic continuing to be fairly volatile? Given that Tiger was such a success, should we expect traffic to get better? It sounds like you're doing a great job with AUR and managing conversion very well. Third, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned reduced sensitivity to cycles.
Oliver Chen
Analyst
0:33:02
I would love for you to let us know what you mean there, in terms of, you know, we've seen so many cycles between hard luxury and softer luxury, as well as thinking about aspirational. Also, beauty is a great category, but it's a great deal you're conducting in terms of partnering with a world leader. Thanks a lot.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:33:26
Regarding handbags, you know that we've done a lot of work since the end of 2024 by reintroducing many new lines in the offer at Gucci, but also at Saint Laurent. The performance that we have on newness in handbags is very positive. We've been suffering from the underperformance of carryover that was offsetting the very good performance of the newness. We are on handbags coming to a point where it equals, and we are very happy to see the performance of the handbags at Gucci stabilizing this quarter. There will be, of course, a lot of new introductions in Q4. You know some of them that you've seen during the cruise show in France, and of course, some other in 2026. The trend is very positive. In terms of %, you know in the mix, you have some seasonal effects.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:34:30
At the moment, I would say in handbags, at the end of September, we were at more than 60% of the sales in handbags were coming from newness. Of course, the newness from last year is now feeding the carryover base. Regarding traffic, traffic improved sequentially during the quarter. It's still largely impacted by Japan and Asia-Pacific.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:35:01
Yeah. I think when I mentioned in my pitch, cyclicality, it's not only a question of the mix of activities we have in the group. By the way, even if the beauty business is no more internalized, what we hope and what is the bet is clearly to increase the level of royalties, which is a solid contribution in terms of EBIT, as you can imagine, and to exploit the full potential of our brands in that segment. In any case, we'll still benefit from this cycle of the beauty business. The hard luxury does represent still a quite substantial part of the business, not yet at the full potential. If you combine the sales of our jewelry brands, but also the jewelry businesses of our fashion brands, we start to have a quite substantial business.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:36:01
It's clear that also our jewelry brands are quite relevant in the different segments of jewelry, meaning high jewelry, fine jewelry, and more accessible jewelry, with also this capacity to absorb some shocks in terms of demand, especially when aspirational demand is weaker. Behind this also, there is the work that we have started at group level and in each brand. That probably, and surely, by the way, Luca will present more in depth and more in detail during next spring. It's a journey that we have started, but clearly, there is the ambition to accelerate this journey, which is to rely more and more on science to be stronger in terms of predictions, in terms of merchandising, in terms of supply chain, so that we can gain in efficiency and to be less, let's say, exposed to aspirational demand, to be stronger in terms of carryover lines, replenishment strategy.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:37:15
That's the reason why we have always said that in our industry, it's a combination of art and science. Clearly, even if we have made some progresses in the past few years, we need to accelerate to be sure that also we have, and that's the spirit of what I was saying about what the group could bring to our brands. It's also some expertise that we will have at group level to push our brands to do better in that direction, which is to be more disciplined in terms of step-through and things like this, which are reducing, obviously, the risk of cyclicality.
Oliver Chen
Analyst
0:37:57
Yeah. Okay. That's really helpful. One quick follow-up on mainland China customer. How would you characterize what you're seeing now? Are you encouraged in terms of rays of light and stabilization, just color on what you think is happening in that dynamic market? Thanks a lot for everything.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:38:16
Consumer spending in mainland China is still not very supportive, but we are seeing some sequential improvements. We are working on the product offers, the retail network, and things are progressing. Of course, we will continue going into Q4 and next year. Things are going in the right direction. We are seeing still some polarization in the customer, but we are progressing in the right direction.

Next question is from Antoine Belvé, BNP Paribas Exane.
Antoine Belge
Analyst
0:39:04
Yes. Good evening, Armelle, Jean-Marc, and Claire. Thanks for all these years of collaborations. Three questions, if I may. First of all, I think you updated a bit the amount of stores that were closed, first of all, at the group level, but at Gucci. Could you maybe comment a bit, giving like not anecdotes, but when you're closing, not only maybe a store in China that is quite close to another, you know, like how much of the business are you recouping? Are you quite encouraged that you're really creating, not losing too many consumers? What's your, obviously, improving the cost base? I understand that it's not a one-year effort, and because I think you're probably waiting for some leases to expire. Net-net, compared to, let's say, the fleet at Gucci at the peak and maybe two years down the road, how many stores could end up being closed?
Antoine Belge
Analyst
0:40:08
My second question on the sort of overall group EBIT for this year. In July, you had mentioned that gross margin in H2 could be quite supported, notably by FX hedging elements. You had given a very precise target for OpEx. Given that Q3, and correct me if I'm wrong, was probably ahead of your own expectations, are you deciding maybe to spend a bit more on OpEx, or are you happy to see consensus, which I think was at $1.7 billion of EBIT, maybe creeping up to $1.8 billion on the fact that also trends seem to be quite good at the beginning of the quarter? Finally, on beauty, $4 billion seems to be a good number for disposing beauty, but I guess it's a combination of two things. One, you know, selling the current business and then probably evaluating what could happen in the future.
Antoine Belge
Analyst
0:41:14
Is it possible maybe to have an idea, especially of the, I mean, are you going purely on the Creed and existing beauty business? Are you going to have to post a loss on asset disposal? If that, what is attributed to that, is less than the $3.5 billion you paid, or actually, that's not the case, and you managed to get an even higher price than you had paid initially? Thank you.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:41:42
Thank you, Antoine. Regarding the store closure, as I mentioned, we are progressing, and we have, of course, 14 stores in the quarter and 55 year to date. As Alpha Fit roughly is attributable to Gucci, what do you mean in terms of recouping the business? It varies from one store to another because it depends on the location. It depends on the store. I could say that generally, we recoup between 30% and 80% of the business. We pay a lot of attention. We generally move the sales assistant from the previous store to the next store. We make sure that we call the clients. We invite them to the new store. I must say we are quite satisfied with the dynamics. It would have to be measured more in the long term, but we are seeing good dynamics in that front.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:42:44
If I may, I will add that going forward, we will continue to work on the network rationalization. Here again, we will have an occasion to be more specific already during the full-year results, but even more during the spring investor meeting. This is an ambition to continue to look at the network, to consider what are the stores which are the less profitable or delivering the lowest returns. We want to concentrate on some key locations and not to distract our brand with too many locations to operate because also it has an implication sometimes, which is to increase the structure and the costs associated with the structure to manage all these stores. We knew, and I think it's among the weaknesses that we have acknowledged in the past few years, was probably that we went a little bit too far in terms of expansion of the network.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:43:46
Without providing any figures, you can assume that in the two coming years, we'll continue to rationalize quite drastically the network.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:43:57
Regarding your second question, I can confirm that we are delivering our plan on cost efficiency. I can confirm the indication that I gave in July, which is that we expect OpEx to be done mid to, I think, a little bit in the full year. Regarding gross margin, here again, I can confirm that we expect gross margin full year or H2 to be at the same level of H1 at constant currencies. Of course, if currency rates stay where they are today, there will be a hedging effect. That will be a tailwind in the gross margin. All in all, you have to keep in mind that FX and hedging combined could have a negative impact up to €50 million in the EBIT. More generally in the EBIT, I also can confirm that H2 EBIT margin will be declining year on year, but much less than in H1.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:45:10
Regarding the price, you said that €4 billion was a good number. That's your assessment. I think that if we reach a deal with L'Oréal, it is because we were thinking on both sides that that was a good number. It's a comprehensive deal, through which L'Oréal and Kering are becoming long-term partners in beauty. This deal encompasses the sale of Kering Beauté as a company with all the subsidiaries and all the activities. It means, in other words, that the sale of Creed as a house, the fact that we are granting the Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga license to L'Oréal. In the price, there is an option or the right to grant the Gucci license, of course, at the expiration of the license with the current terms and conditions we have with Coty. To make it simple, it's Creed plus two licenses plus an option to grant a license.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:46:16
We don't split the price so far. What I can tell you is that in terms of capital employed at group level in our balance sheet, the capital employed attached to the beauty business is below €4 billion. You take it the way you want, but at the end of the story, it will be a net gain before tax for the group. The recognition of this profit is something we need to continue to work on because from an accounting and tax standpoint, there will probably be a need to allocate the price. What has been negotiated is a global price. I think it's a good price for both parties considering the ambitions we have on both sides for beauty brands, but also for the joint venture because don't forget that in the deal, there is a joint venture which is very promising.

Zuzanna Pusz
Analyst
0:47:32
Thank you for taking my questions. I'd also like to say thank you so much, Claire, for all of the years and all of your wonderful help. I agree, everyone will really miss you. Three questions from me. First of all, on the Chinese consumer, in case I missed it, I don't think you commented on the sequential performance of the Chinese consumer. I was just wondering if you had seen any improvement. I think that was sort of the key surprise from one of your peers. If you could tell us a little bit, maybe especially for Gucci, how that cluster has performed. Secondly, on the store network rationalization, just to follow up because Jean-Marc, you mentioned that, if I understood correctly, for the next two years, we should still expect some further rationalization.
Zuzanna Pusz
Analyst
0:48:24
I remember you mentioned in the past that the space would be flat despite some store closures because the existing stores will be made bigger. I just wanted to confirm if that's still the case. Finally, just a follow-up on current trends, I guess I wanted to understand, I mean, the comparable because we don't know the comparable basis across every month. I just wanted to understand because you mentioned August was the best. September was in line with the quarter, which surprised me a bit because I would have thought it would be better given the, you know, sort of a little bit more excitement around Gucci.
Zuzanna Pusz
Analyst
0:49:10
I'm just trying to understand, is it reasonable given that in Q3, you had seen an improvement ahead of the comp and you are seeing comp getting tougher, but is it still likely that Q4 is going to be better than Q3 or that improvement ahead of the comp is sort of a bit slower now and we should actually expect sales to be weaker then, just to get a rough idea around that? Thank you.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:49:41
Thank you, Susanna. The Chinese cluster improved slightly sequentially for all the brands. The improvement is driven both by the domestic market and by the tourist. We saw improvement on the tourist, but still a double-digit negative trend in all regions, especially in Japan due to the higher comp base and also the less attractive price.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:50:15
Yeah. As regards to store rationalization, I think our position has evolved, to be clear, in the sense that it's not a secret to say that the sales density is not on par with our expectations, and I would not dare to say on par with the competitors. There is a need first to recover in terms of sales density. It does mean, in other words, that of course, if you look brand by brand, maybe it's difficult to say that all the brands will see both a reduction of the store count and of the square meters. Globally speaking, at group level, we envisage to reduce the total surface, even if probably the reduction will not be exactly at the same level in terms of % than the total number of stores because still some brands in the group deserve to have a decent size.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:51:22
If we take, and it's always the same example for many years, Bottega Veneta, it's true that now considering the growing share of ready-to-wear collections and footwear and the success of these collections, we need, in some cases, to have larger stores. We have not enough flagship for this brand. Even for Balenciaga, we may have some situations where we will need to consolidate in a larger store. Overall and directionally, over two years, there will be a reduction of the number of stores and of the square footage.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
0:52:02
August was the best month of the quarter on each comp, and September was in line with the performance of the quarter. It's true that we launched La Familia product in September, but it was only 10 stores. You know it cannot change completely the picture on the September performance. Going forward, what we see for Q4 is that, of course, you know consumer confidence is uneven. There is a lot of uncertainty. From what we see so far, I would say that we could expect that Q4 sales decline year on year could be in the same order of magnitude of Q3, despite a tougher comp base.
Zuzanna Pusz
Analyst
0:52:52
Thank you. Just to clarify, basically, despite the tougher comp base, can we expect, is it across the group or for Gucci specifically, Q4 to be in line with Q3?
Armelle Poulou

Thomas Chauvet
Analyst
0:53:29
Good evening, Armelle, Jean-Marc, and Claire. Claire Roblet, sure, thanks to you for over a decade of hard work, great partnership with the analysts. You'll be missed. Thanks again. Three questions, please. One on rightsizing and two on L'Oréal Kering transaction. On rightsizing, if we look at your luxury houses, we exclude Eyewear, we exclude Beauty, your 2025 revenue will be more or less one-third lower than at the peak of 2022, so just three years ago. You say, Jean-Marc, in your concluding remarks, reigniting the top line is the priority. Until then, is there further rightsizing of the cost base that's needed at the Kering holding level, at the individual brand level? Anything concrete, maybe you and Luca and Armelle have started working on beyond what you've already initiated at the end of last year and the distribution footprint rationalization you've just talked about?
Thomas Chauvet
Analyst
0:54:29
Secondly, on L'Oréal, first on the rationale and the opportunity or maybe the missed opportunity. When you took over the Safilo license 10 years ago, ballpark, my understanding is you thought you would do, in the long run, a better job than your license partner in terms of distribution, marketing, production with the right people as long as you learn about this métier. I guess you delivered on those promises. You said, ""This is core. This has critical mass."" Now, when it comes to Beauty, what was the trigger in the last year or so that made you think you wouldn't be able to replicate the same success as you did in Eyewear, to give up maybe so quickly after creating this division? Especially, you could integrate the Gucci license in just three years. Where do you think your lack of competence is relative to L'Oréal? I'm curious about that.
Thomas Chauvet
Analyst
0:55:22
Thirdly, on L'Oréal and numbers, is €4 billion the net amount you expect to cash in in H1 next year? Are there any other deductions or additions to that amount we need to be aware of, particularly who will pay for the potential early buyback of the Coty license? Will you redeem early some of your existing bonds with that cash? Thank you.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:55:54
I don't want to be too specific on your first question because I will not enter into the details of all the things and all the initiatives we have started with Armelle, but also with the HR teams, and also under, of course, the leadership of Luca. What I can tell you is that in the last two years with Armelle, we had already started to tackle what could be tackled rapidly and to grab all the low-hanging fruits in terms of savings. It was easy to do in a way. What we have started to encourage clearly by Luca is to look more structurally at the way we operate, not only in all the corporate organizations at Kering level, but also in the brands, but also when it comes to big platforms like IT or logistics. We know that we can chase some efficiency more.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:56:59
I think what we have started now is something which is more structural, which is to look at the ways we are working. It will continue during 2026. We expect with some gains, and sometimes also with some reinvestment. You know, bouncing back to the first question we had at the beginning of the call from Cara, of course, there is some cost-cutting, but there is some reinvestment. We need also to recruit some talents in the group. I think we will make savings, but we will also try to also boost the efficiency of the organization. Sometimes it will imply to recruit some people to invest in new technologies. For sure, yes, we will continue to work on the rightsizing of the organization. I already mentioned the discussion around retail, which is part of the process of being more efficient. What's the rationale?
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:58:03
To be honest, I will start by saying that we are very proud of the job that has been done by the Kering Beauté team. They did a terrific job. The integration of Creed has been very successful. The launches they made at Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta were absolutely at the top and outstanding with a very good reception. In a way, we have been so successful that clearly it has triggered a lot of also appetite from the market and from our competitors. It is also our duty as a management to regularly review our strategic options.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:58:47
It's true that at a point, you know, feeling that there was some appetite in the market for our activities, we just started an analysis and discussed with the board because at the end of the day, it was a board decision to see if we could pursue our journey on a standalone basis, but if we had also some other routes to go, especially in a market which is probably a little bit tougher currently for the beauty business. In terms of risk and reward analysis, whatever the success we had, and we were confident that we had a very good team at Kering Beauté, and we could have pursued our standalone way quite successfully.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
0:59:30
If we look at the math and we want to go faster to avoid also capital, if we want to optimize capital allocation, considering that it's a quite capital-intensive business, probably more than the eyewear business, we decided to look at the different options. It was a process that accelerated more recently, but it's a process that started before, and that was clearly decided by François-Henri so that we can move in that direction without taboo. It was fully supported by the board. Clearly, with the energy and the vision of Luca, we have been able to accelerate and to strike a deal so very recently. That was the rationale behind this move. Clearly, you know that when we made the move with Kering Eyewear, at that time, the Gucci license with Safilo was already one of the leading licenses in the eyewear business, even the first one.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:00:37
We had quite rapidly a critical scale. We knew that it would be completely different with the beauty business. It was really what we call in the business school a strategic dilemma now. We made all the pros and cons of each solution. The reason for taking that way was not because we were disappointed by the job done by the team, because I think they were above expectations in terms of delivery, and Creed was on par with the initial business plan. I will not comment further as regards the price that has been paid. So far, the plan is to wait for the expiration of the license. We will see if at the point there will be an opportunity to discuss with Coty. So far, as I said, there is an option, and we will see at the end of the license what will happen.
Armelle Poulou

Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:02:00
€4 billion, plus or minus minor adjustments that you have already in the deal, because when you sell a company like Creed and Kering Beauté, naturally, you may have some adjustments depending on the working capital situation or what you know in an M&A deal.

Yes. Hi. Good evening, Armelle and Jean-Marc. Also, thank you, Claire, on my side, for a great collaboration and hard work. I have three questions, please. The first one is on Gucci. The Demna presentation and film is very U.S.-centric, it seems. Do the Chinese react to it? Maybe if you can comment about the performance of Gucci during the Golden Week. My second question is about the wholesale performance. What could we expect by year-end for all the brands, and should we see a further decline in wholesale next year, or have you done for the key brands, especially Gucci? Finally, concerning Balenciaga, the recent Balenciaga stores are big and Demna-driven, and as a consequence, not in line with the new direction of the brand, given the limited financial means, or will you prioritize the CapEx allocation? Thank you very much.
Armelle Poulou

Regarding La Familia, you know it was presented in 10 stores all over the world in every region. It's true that we had a very good response in the U.S., but also in Europe, and also to mention in Japan, especially with local Japan press.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
1:04:01
We have already a pretty good response in China, maybe not with us to the same extent as the very strong one we had in the U.S. Regarding the Golden Week, you know, consumer spending is not very supportive in mainland China. Overall, this year's Golden Week is not changing the picture, even if some brands are posting better results than last year. For wholesale, we are confirming our indication that wholesale should decrease by $350 million, maybe slightly more, over the full year. It decreased already $330 million year to date. For next year, we expect this number to, we expect wholesale to stabilize as we have done most of the rationalization of the doors. Of course, it always depends on the dynamic of the wholesalers themselves.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:05:04
Maybe you wanted to jump on the question of,
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
1:05:06
Yes.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:05:07
Thomas that we had.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
1:05:08
Thomas, I had the answer, but we jumped. Very quickly, coming back on your question regarding potential bond buybacks, we will, of course, and the management of the cash inflow. Of course, first, it's written on our balance sheet. We will balance between cash investment and potential buyback of some bonds, trying to be smart but also always very mindful of our liquidity profile.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:05:38
Maybe a word on the store footprint of Balenciaga. In recent years, we have enlarged, on average, the stores of Balenciaga. First of all, nothing is changing regarding the categories that we have at Balenciaga. It will remain, in any case, a brand with ready-to-wear, leather goods, footwear, with a good proportion of men and women in the collection. When it comes to the size, I'm not particularly worried. When it comes to the denim aesthetic, you see, first of all, that in the first show, there was Pierpaolo, there was a bridge, in a way, with what was the aesthetic of denim. It was a good combination. We don't plan a short-term major reshuffle of the network. All the stores have not exactly the same magnitude in terms of aesthetic.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:06:44
We have already tested some mockups where, obviously, just the addition of a few things and also some painting, additional painting, things like that can easily create an environment that would be very consistent with the new collection. Here again, we don't expect a jump in terms of CapEx on that side. As usual, with Armelle and under the helm of Luca, we will have a global arbitration at group level of the CapEx to be sure that we have to do, we invest rightfully in the right places and especially at the right pace.

Charles-Louis Scotti

1:07:36
Good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have three. Congratulations, obviously, to Claire and best of luck in your role. On the denim first collection, which will be rolled out globally in January, could you remember, also, you mentioned in the past, capsules for Christmas and Chinese New Year, as well as the cruise collections before the presentation of fall-winter 2026, end of February. If I'm not mistaken, could you please update us on the coming pipeline at Gucci? Secondly, the deal with L'Oréal includes as well a joint venture on the longevity, health, and wellness. L'Oréal already gave us some details yesterday about it. Could you tell us more about this joint venture? Is this part of a broader move towards a more experiential luxury, which seems to be gaining a lot of momentum now? Third question, regarding your beauty licenses for Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.
Charles-Louis Scotti
Analyst
1:08:35
You previously had a very selective approach in terms of distribution, which obviously mechanically limits the development potential. This is not, I guess, L'Oréal's strategy, even for the couture brands, except for the private collections. Are you now more open to adopting a maybe less selective strategy that will allow the business to scale up more quickly? Thank you very much.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
1:08:59
The denim collection will be distributed in stores as of January 26. In Q4, there are many initiatives at Gucci. We just introduced a new sneaker, the Gucci Shift. There is also the cruise show collection that is arriving in store in November. Of course, there will be plenty of capsule and animation in December for the Chinese New Year and more generally for the holiday season. That will be amplified by some campaigns. There is already a campaign that you've seen probably on the new Shift sneaker on digital. There is also a campaign on the ski altitude. There will be, of course, the Gucci Shift campaign at the end of the year as it happened last year.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:09:48
I don't know if I can add something relevant to what Mr. Babuild said brilliantly yesterday. I think we are convinced on both sides that definitely there is an opportunity in that segment of wellness, longevity. It's true that it has to do with how luxury experience can expand in different categories, in different areas. We see that today, the high-net-worth individuals and many top clients of our brands are reallocating wallet also to experience, resorts, travels, restaurants, and also wellness and longevity, which has become clearly a topic for the billionaires and high-net-worth individuals. Yes, definitely, we are at the early days of this joint venture. We are convinced that, of course, the idea for us is not to work on products because it's really the expertise of L'Oréal. I think there are a lot of R&D in that area.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:11:05
For us, it's more about finding some synergies, bringing also our capacity to find locations in the city, outside of the city, to create an environment which does correspond to the expectations of these clients, to work on our CRM and database with the top clients we have. This is really what we are targeting, to really provide to this clientele a unique experience, mixing wellness, medical care to a certain extent, and also so that they can enjoy a pleasant environment with a luxury experience. We believe this is a market which is very fragmented, on which there is an opportunity probably to consolidate and to be with this joint venture a major player, considering that our two groups are global and the capacity to enter in the main cities in the world and also to provide unique experiences.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:12:18
When it comes to Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, your question is a good one. I think the plan, you know, that historically, these two licenses of these two brands have been completely under-exploited in the beauty category. We had to rebuild credibility, and we started by launching these niche products, these niche fragrances, very elevated in terms of quality, in terms of price. It was a way to reestablish the credibility of these brands in the beauty segment. Clearly, the plan for Kering Beauté, especially for Balenciaga and to a certain extent to Bottega Veneta, but the positioning of the brands are slightly different. The idea was at a point, once we had started to be credible again, to go down to the prestige segment with a broader distribution, with the usual suspects in terms of distribution. It was part of the game.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:13:23
If I come back to the rationale of the joint venture, of the deal with L'Oréal, clearly, the idea is that, of course, we can scale up that business more rapidly. We are very pleased if we could accelerate the development of these two brands, but starting with Balenciaga in the more prestige segment, considering that, of course, we will, and that was some of the discussions we had with L'Oréal. Of course, we want to keep an offer which is very elevated for the top clients and also to have some fragrances in our stores.

Carole Madjo
Analyst
1:14:09
Hi. Yes. Good evening. A few questions from me as well, and also on my side. Thank you very much, Claire, for all your time. It was really good to discuss with you over the past few years. To come back on the first question being on Gucci, can you help us understand a bit more what should be the position of Gucci going forward? I guess to come back on the point you mentioned before, you talk about trying to reduce cyclicality, about being a bit more exposed to the high-end consumer. Then talk, I think, about being a bit more exposed towards minimalism at Gucci when he does his first fashion show in February. Can you just, I guess, help us envision what could be the new Gucci in terms of pricing point, brand aesthetic, and positioning going forward? That's the first question.
Carole Madjo
Analyst
1:14:54
Second question, just to come back also on the jewelry side in the other houses, which I think has been quite solid for the past few quarters now, can you remind us how big jewelry, so the Boucheron and Pomellato brand mostly, count for now in this division? What kind of potential do you see for these, for those brands, going forward? Thank you.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
1:15:18
Your question on Gucci is an interesting one. I think it will be part of probably a larger strategic update that Luca and the team will give during the CMD in the spring. What I can tell you at this stage, going back to La Familia presentation as an example, it was very positive to see that the looks that Denim presented were large in their style, in the categories. I think it was showing how diverse and rich the Gucci brand can be and very true to the DNA of the brand. Regarding jewelry, I can just mention that if I look at last year, the turnover of our jewelry brands altogether was around €1 billion.

Thank you. Next question is from Luca Solca, Bernstein.
Luca Solca
Analyst
1:16:28
Yes. Good evening. Congratulations to Claire and her next step within the company. Two or three questions. I was sort of detailed questions now at this stage. I was wondering, when you look at the retail dynamics going forward, so the retail network being trimmed and potentially space being reduced, would that go hand in hand with rental costs also being reduced? I doubt that because most likely you would be closing tail stores and you would be beefing up flagship and prime locations. I just wanted to be sure what you thought about this. Maybe a more general question on the EBIT consensus that you see. There's been many moving parts, the reacceleration over the summer and the cost efficiency program continuing. I wonder if you want to touch base on that guidance that you provided or if not. Maybe more of a blue sky question on Armani.
Luca Solca
Analyst
1:17:44
You're obviously focusing on your own business and on improving it organically, but you haven't been shy, for example, with the Valentino acquisition to play a protagonist role in consolidating some of the most important Italian fashion brands. I wonder if this is on your radar screen at all and if we could envisage down the road a role for you, especially in a scenario where L'Oréal could potentially try an Estée Lauder deal, that is buying the brand for the beauty business and licensing out the fashion and leather goods business as in the case of Tom Ford, was done by Estée Lauder with Zegna. Thank you.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:18:44
We don't streamline the network just for the sake of making some savings on the rental cost. The idea is just to be sure that we have the right setup brand by brand. I think that there was a wave of utilization in the past few years, which was made across the board. For all the brands, I think all the brands are not in a situation because of the size, because of the product categories, in a situation to be at 80% or 90% retailized. If I think about Brioni or Alexander McQueen, these are brands which probably need to rebalance a little bit between wholesale and retail. I would not say the same for the other brands where there is still the ambition to have predominantly a retail distribution.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:19:37
The idea is just to be sure that we have the right setup and that we don't multiply the number of points of sale in a city, that we keep the most efficient one and that we are able to increase the sales density. We have to be very lucid and we are very candid on this. The problem of the group is not so much about the rental cost. There will be opportunities to reduce the rental cost for sure, but it's more about the sales density. The purpose for us is, of course, to have the right setup. When there is an opportunity to renegotiate a rental or the rent, we will do it. Part of the game also in this reshuffling of the network is also to create the conditions to renegotiate some rent.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:20:27
The ambition is, first of all, to maximize the efficiency of the network, to reignite the top line, as we said before.
Armelle Poulou
Group CFO
1:20:37
On the outlook for this year, I gave already a lot of moving parts regarding top line, gross margin, and OpEx. Maybe what I can flag additionally is that, if foreign exchanges remain at current level, the drag on Q4 reported sales will be higher than the one in Q3. For the rest, I think I gave you already a lot of information.
Jean-Marc Duplaix
Group COO
1:21:01
About your last question, you can imagine that it's premature to comment. Also, you know, we have just signed a deal, which was very important for us. We have the Valentino brand in the radar going forward, even if we have postponed the exercise of the options. Still, there will be a need at a point to integrate the brand. We have a lot of challenges in our brand. I think our plate is quite full so far, and the priority for us is to work on the action plan that Luca is giving to us and to the brands. It's not a consideration we have so far about Armani. We will see what will happen with the different players that have been listed in the testament of Mr. Armani.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the Prada Group's nine month 2025 revenue update. With me today is our Group CEO, Andrea Guerra.

Before we start, please be reminded that during today's call, we may discuss forward-looking statements which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and factors beyond our control, and the actual outcome and returns may differ materially from such statements.

Buongiorno and thank you to all, to be with us today. As we stated in our press release, our performance has been solid, has been on the same pace of the year, also comparing with very different comps and tough comps of last year, and with some precious improvements that we will talk about. We all know by now, hopefully, that we're all working in a different world and a different industry. To continue with this rhythm, after two years of the beginning of this new world, it means that we have been able to attract and please, with our brands and products, our clients.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:02:06
Considering the extent and duration of our like-for-like improvement during so many quarters, now it means that all the work we have been able to do so far, all the effort, all the commitment that we have put on our people, organization, and retail excellence is finally beginning to really pay off. We are happy about this. Prada, Prada performance, I would define it resilient with a twist. That is, we have seen a negative sign in the second part of your Q2, as we all remember, and in the very initial part of Q3. We have been observing a slow and continuous and steady improvement of product results. Obviously, not helped by traffic. I would say that traffic is normalizing, is leveling off, but really reaping benefits from all the work done on retail activities, brands, products, together with our people in the stores across the world.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:03:24
We have seen an improvement, Prada. On the other side, Miu Miu was really against an impossible quarter. If I recall well, it was basically plus 100% on 2023. We obtained another solid quarter. What is good and nice to observe about Miu Miu is that our attitudes, behaviors, are growing with the dimension of the brand. I think it has to be stated that the growth of Miu Miu has been very well balanced between price points, in the price mix volume, across the different product categories, and throughout all regions. This is why I'm saying that the journey is continuing pretty solid. Having said this, I will pass the word to Andrea to give you some more details on our number and performance.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:04:36
Thank you, Andrea. Starting with net revenues by channel. In total, the group recorded net revenues of €4.1 billion in the first nine months of the year, up 9% against the same period last year at constant FX and effects. The performance was driven by high-quality retail growth sustained by like-for-like, full-price sales, and limited contribution from space. The third quarter confirmed a consistent and solid growth trajectory, with retail sales up 8% against the same comparatives in the prior year period. As a reminder, in 2024, retail channel growth was remarkably consistent at +18% in all quarters. Wholesale was up 4% in the first nine months and up 19% in Q3. The channel was impacted by some degree of phasing in Q2/Q3, but our strategy remains unchanged as we maintain a selective approach with independence.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:05:35
Royalties continued to grow, up 11% over the periods, supported by both eyewear and beauty. Exchange rates had a negative impact on group revenue of circa 260 basis points during the first nine months and 470 basis points over the quarter. The impact is expected to be even more meaningful in Q4. Turning to the next slide, the retail sales by brand. All our brands continue to show healthy trajectories. Prada delivered a resilient performance, -2% in the nine months, with the third quarter edging closer to flat, supported by all key regions. Miu Miu reported sustained growth throughout the period at +41% and +29% in the quarter, with widespread appreciation across all regions and categories, as Andrea mentioned. As a result, the brand contribution to the group retail sales increased to 32% against 25% in the same period of last year.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:06:40
Church's was also back in double-digit territory in the quarter. Moving to the next slide, retail sales by geography. Asia Pacific delivered double-digit growth over the first nine months at +10%. Growth was also up double-digit in Q3, with some sign of improvements in trends in mainland China extending into October. Positive performance in Europe, up 6% in the nine months. Trends were similar between Q2 and Q3, as local demand proved resilient and tourism softer. Good progression in the Americas, where retail sales were up 15% in the nine months, with Q3 at +20% in further sequential acceleration. Japan grew against exceptionally high tourism in 2024, delivering +3% over the nine months period. Q3 was down 1% but improving quarter on quarter, driven by solid local demand and increased traveler spending.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:07:44
Lastly, the Middle East delivered a solid performance, up 21% in the nine months, with Q3 in moderation at 10% on high comps. With that, I will hand back to Andrea Guerra for some closing remarks.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:08:01
Gracias, Andrea. Now we're entering in the usual holiday period, and not only. I think in the next three to six months, we will observe in our industry a lot of novelties, all these new entries, all these new products, shows, and news. We have shown our pace and rhythm so far. We are here yet very committed on our creative leadership. We are standing and being authentic to contemporary art, culture, and craft. We will continue in our solid journey. We will continue to invest in our creativity and desirability. We feel home in this new normal. We have started reaping fruits from all our investments on people, organization, processes, and retail. Our flexibility and velocity will obviously continue to be one of our primary characteristics. We have entered the usual Q4, where the last six weeks of the year become paramount.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:09:16
In these four weeks of October, Prada is going to continue to improve. Miu Miu continues its journey and, obviously, its long-term normalization. We are happy so far. With this, gracias, we now turn the word to you. I will give back the word to the operator.

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on Versace. Now that the deal has closed, I was wondering if you could share your initial take on your first priorities that you have identified, investment needed that you see, distribution strategy from here, any initial take you can share with us on the Versace integration, please. That's my first question.
Andrea Guerra

Chiara Battistini
Executive Director
0:11:16
Okay. My bad. I thought it was. Second question on Prada and the improvement you've seen, that you mentioned you've seen, through Q3. You mentioned briefly that this seems to have continued also in the first few weeks of October, if I got that right. Could you share in terms of current trading? Maybe if you can expand on current trading, what is driving that? Is that a comment on the broader environment, or is it really the company-specific initiatives that are supporting that ongoing improvement?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:11:50
I am not observing very different things happening in the world now. What we have seen in the last three months is basically the same. That is, we have seen a kind of plateau in China. Holidays were better than what we expected, but I would keep the word plateau. What we had observed was that we had fewer Americans in Europe, and obviously, nowadays, are less influent on our performance in Europe. We obviously had noticed that after a strong tourism inflow in Japan, strong, it's probably even small but huge. I think that the first half last year, the group realized something like plus 60% in Japan. What we have seen is a very strong work also by our Japanese team on local customers. I think we have been pretty resilient there. Now we're seeing our normal journey and performance.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:13:18
In the United States, I think on some part of it is Americans that have traveled the east less. On the other side, if you remember, we also talked about the fact that we didn't do any big revolutions during these years. One that we did a little bit was in the United States, where we decided to be a little bit more aggressive in changing behaviors, attitudes, and culture. I think we had a great reaction by people that have been a long time with us. We had some new entries. I think that we are accelerating in North America. This is how I see it so far. Always, and I always will repeat, in Q4, October has very little meaning compared to the last six weeks of the year.
Chiara Battistini
Executive Director
0:14:18
Indeed. Thank you. Maybe last question, just a clarification on the wholesale trends in Q3. It was a very good number. Anything exceptional in terms of timing of shipments?

Leaving aside Miu Miu, a Prada brand, the improvement quarter on quarter has been mainly driven by local transactions across all key regions, I would say. Tourism overall marginally better, and if you get into the specifics of the different clusters, again, only Prada brand. The Chinese, better quarter on quarter, but still negative. As I said, improvement driven by both locals and travelers. Europeans, flattish on the nine months. Q3 positive, and again, better quarter on quarter, driven by local demand. The North Americans was positive, low single digit in the nine months, improving in Q3, and sustained by domestic demand. On the Japanese, positive, low single digit in the nine months, improving again in Q3, supported mainly by very solid locals.
Chris Huang
Associate Director of Equity Research
0:16:28
Okay. Perfect. That's super helpful. The next one I have is actually space. I remember earlier in the year, we were talking about maybe in H2 this year, we start to see a little bit more space growth kick in. What's your latest thinking around the store expansion when it comes to both Prada and Miu Miu? Shall we expect something to kick in in Q4, or is it mostly going to be in 2026?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:16:58
We have executed what we were thinking on Miu Miu. We have something like 10 or 12 stores more, and we have enlarged some square meters in another 8 to 10 stores. That execution, that plan, has moved as planned. On Prada, we have taken a more cautious journey. More cautious, I mean, we want to have stores in other great locations, but we want also to close stores that have got no meaning. Yes, we had a couple more, but in reality, in the next 12 months, probably even 24 months, with Prada, we will have 6, 7, 8 more, but probably 10 less or 12 less. We constantly, I think that our journey with Prada will continue to be a reshuffle. I think that there is an opportunity to be even more productive. I think that Prada is being more productive nowadays, even more productive going forward.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:18:29
We keep on with our 80, 85% like-for-like and 10, 15% on new space or enlarged space.
Chris Huang
Associate Director of Equity Research
0:18:39
Okay. Perfect. Lastly, our margins. I know this is a revenues call, but it'll be very helpful to hear about what you're thinking about the four-year margins. I think you've always stated the ambition of delivering a steady margin improvement, you know, into the midterm. Just looking at the growth profile, you managed to deliver in H1 and also so far Q3, and in light of the very tough comps in Q4, are you still expecting, on a four-year basis, margins to see some expansion, or shall we start to see a little bit of more investments into the year end, and hence putting some pressure on your margin development?
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:19:26
Oh, nothing to add, to be honest. I mean, vis-à-vis what we said at H1, the only part of your comment, Chris, that I didn't get is when you say, did you mention light comps in Q4? I don't know if.
Chris Huang
Associate Director of Equity Research
0:19:43
I know I said tough comps in Q4.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:19:46
Tough. Sorry.
Chris Huang
Associate Director of Equity Research
0:19:46
In light of the tough comps. Sorry.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:19:49
Yes. No, because indeed, I mean, I was going to say, no, they were not light because, again, you know, 2024 for us was very consistent in terms of group growth because it was stable at +18%, with Prada higher in Q4 and Miu Miu moderating a little, but we're still talking +84% in Q4 2024 for Miu Miu. Nothing to add on the margin front. I mean, so far, we are on track to deliver on what we always said. As Andrea mentioned earlier, Q4 from mid-November onward is really relevant, what happens then. Yes, we have a bit more of, in terms of phasing of advertising, communication is a bit more heavy. As I said, so far, nothing to highlight.
Chris Huang
Associate Director of Equity Research

Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
0:20:51
We are now going to proceed with our next question. The questions come from Edouard Aubin from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.
Ed Aubin
Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst
0:21:01
Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Andrea Bonini, just to follow up on the margin. Apologies, I know it's, again, it's a sales call. On the FX, your friends at Kering mentioned yesterday—I don't know if you had time to listen to the call—about the headwinds. They quantified about €50 million for them on a net basis in H2. I'm not going to ask you to quantify anything, but how are you thinking about the FX headwind for H2 and a little bit of color in terms of 2026, to what extent it could be or not be an issue for you? That would be my first question.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:21:39
Hi, Ed. I would only say that for 2025, you know, the hedging strategies will do the job, so not so much an issue. 2026 may be clearly, I mean, may be a headwind. I think we all know also that the situation can be very volatile when it comes to FX. We shall see.
Ed Aubin
Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst
0:22:09
Okay. Understood. The next question, sorry, I don't mean to allocate the question, but it's more for Andrea Guerra. You've been asked, Andrea, over the past few months and the past few years about the industry, the price point, and the middle income being priced out or not. By raising prices quite aggressively, some of your competitors over the past five years have kind of provided oxygen for more aspirational brands to grow. In terms of your product offering, and I know you got the question in the past, I just wanted to get an update from you. To what extent does that represent an opportunity for you, for the Prada Group, to play with the mix and maybe launch a bit more accessible bags in leather goods? I know you guys have been relaunching in nylon, also the crochet bag and so on.
Ed Aubin
Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst
0:23:02
At £1,500 per bag for the crochet, people will debate if it's accessible or not. On the leather goods, more specifically, when it comes to bags, could you comment on the pricing architecture and if you're happy with what you have now?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:23:21
Obviously, the two brands are different. My philosophy is not changing. That is, on one side, we have to be very solid on our enterprise, which does not mean to reduce enterprise, but to keep it and to be credible on our enterprises. To have an offer there. I think that this is the first point. The second point, I always push our merchandising activities to be a little bit half people that are doing an architectural world and on the other side, people that are doing a more artistic world. We have constantly to work on the different price levels, on the different product segments, understand season by season how we can move from one to another, how we can insert some new products, and how can we move, let's say, in the mid-level upwards.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:24:33
There is a world where I think that we have been not serious enough and maybe not courageous enough sometimes, which is high price. We're credible, and this is what we are proving ourselves. We had an exceptional last week in New York, presenting our high jewelry Color Vivant collection, and we had a success that somehow also surprised many of us, not all of us. The thing is, we have to be more bold. We have to be more serious because the consumer is ready for us at those price levels, and we have to deliver. I think that in terms of price and mix, I would give you this answer divided into three segments.
Ed Aubin
Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst
0:25:41
Okay. Wonderful. The last one for me, and apologies 'cause it's a bit of a big-picture question on the sales call. I think investors would be really curious to have your views on the topic. The topic is, there is a bit of a debate in the fashion industry and amongst investors if kind of the fast so-called fashion pendulum is shifting away from kind of more minimalist to a bit more maximalist and a bit more color and a less understated and so on and so forth. You know, would be curious to have your views on that. I mean, obviously, it's always difficult to assess these trends and to know when they start and for how long they could last. What's your view on you guys are the fashion experts, so what's your view on the topic?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:26:26
I think the following. On one side, we have the shows, which are shows allowing people to express, people to deliver the future, people that are giving their sense of that moment. There is the world and life. The two have to be connected. The two sides have to be on tension. Nowadays, I would say that I don't see major pendulums. What I think that is proving to be very correct and to prove to be very successful is people that are authentic to their history, to their cultural pillars, and to their creative hearts. This is what I see.
Ed Aubin
Managing Director and Senior Equity Analyst
0:27:31
Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Andrea Bonini

Next question, please.
Operator
0:27:36
We are now going to proceed with our next question. Another question from Charles Luis Scotti from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please ask your question.
Charles-Louis Scotti
Head of Luxury Goods Equity Research
0:27:48
Yes. Good afternoon. I have three questions, please. The first one, one of your competitors said that the e-commerce business is stabilizing, which is generally a good sign for the aspirational clientele. Do you also see a slight comeback from aspirational customers who have now reduced their luxury spendings over the past few years?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:28:12
It's what I was saying at the beginning. We are living in a new normal, and we are living on a plateau. Let's see from this plateau if we go upwards or again downwards, but it's a plateau. It's a plateau now of four, five, six months. If there are any signs, but I would call weak signals, I would consider them more positive than negative, but very weak signals.
Charles-Louis Scotti
Head of Luxury Goods Equity Research
0:28:46
Okay. Thank you very much. My second question, it seems that you have ambitions to build a larger multi-brand Italian conglomerate with the acquisition of Versace. An iconic brand could change hands in the coming months. I know you haven't been mentioned among the potential bidders, but would you be open to considering an offer if your beauty partner were to acquire Armani and seek a partner to manage the fashion division, a little bit like what Estée Lauder did with Denia on Tom Ford?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:29:24
I don't think time is coming up. I don't think we were not invited, let's say. We have always been looking to the world, looking to the brands, having great respect for that brand. I would not consider this question realistic today.
Charles-Louis Scotti
Head of Luxury Goods Equity Research
0:29:48
Okay. Thank you very much. Last question. I know it's a bit premature because you have not closed the deal on Versace. I don't know if you have access to the numbers, by the way, but if yes, could you tell us, also for modeling purposes and to assess the potential impact of the consolidation of the brand on your numbers, whether the brand current performance is in line with the latest target given by Capri. I think it was €800 million for fiscal year ending March 2026. How do you assess also the medium to long-term target that were previously set by Capri?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:30:29
We have access to the same public figures you have. Be careful to not mess up dollars with euros because they're reporting in dollars. Today, being an American comp.
Charles-Louis Scotti

Next question, please.
Operator
0:31:09
We are now going to proceed with our next question. The questions come from Chris Cao from CLSA. Please ask your question.
Chris Gao
Research Analyst
0:31:21
Hi, management. Thanks for taking my question. I have three. Firstly, as a quick follow-up on China's sequential improvement. In the third-quarter reporting season, some of your peers highlighted the improvement in China is mainly on traffic and volume. I am just wondering if you also see the same trend or which of the retail metrics, in your view, is improving more. Is it foot traffic, is it conversion, or price or mix? Also, if there's any categories that have been seeing more explicit improvement, is it related to wear or bags or accessories that's been seeing more improvement? Thank you.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:32:03
We had given before an outlook, and what we have seen recently in China. I will repeat. On one side, we plateaued. On the other side, we have seen some good signs during holidays. This is what we stated before, and this is what I will repeat now. Holidays were a little bit better than what we expected. I think that the worst is over, but I don't think that we will ever see again in the near future what we have seen in the last decade.
Chris Gao
Research Analyst
0:32:47
Thank you. The second question is regarding the acceleration on American clusters. Just wondering if there could be any highlights on if Prada core brand is improving more or if it's Miu Miu brand that has been mainly driving the acceleration for Americas.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:33:06
Always keep in mind that Miu Miu in the United States is marginal. Miu Miu is constantly increasing. I think that we are doing a good job with Miu Miu joining the brand to many different city and city clusters, even where we don't have stores through omni-line projects. I think that we are really doing a good job there. The sequential improvement is obviously coming, specifically from Prada. I mean, both are growing, but Prada is big. It's much bigger.
Chris Gao
Research Analyst
0:33:48
Okay, understand. Maybe also from a retail matrix perspective, what could be, you know, the main supporting on the Prada core brands recovering in the U.S.? Is it traffic, traffic, or it's more coming from the price mix?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:34:07
I mean, all my conversation on Prada was to allow you to understand where we are. I just said that traffic is not helping, that we are reaping the benefits of our retail investments, and that our product launches were good. This is what I'm saying. It's a like-for-like growth. We had no real growth, but the improvement is all like-for-like, and hopefully, we will see positive results soon.
Chris Gao
Research Analyst
0:34:44
Thank you very much. Helpful.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:34:46
It's a pleasure.
Chris Gao
Research Analyst
0:34:46
I'm going to ask you the last question. Last question is regarding the development of other categories like jewelry. Right now, we see gold prices being going in a very good trend. We also know that Prada has been launching very good sustainable gold collections. Just wondering how the jewelry categories are performing. Thank you.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:35:11
I will repeat. We just launched a new collection. The name is Color Vivant. We had a fantastic first week in New York, and now we will tour the most important cities in the next three, four months with this collection. We're very proud of it. We're really very proud of it. Thank you. Operator, thank you.
Operator
0:35:46
Thank you. We are now going to proceed with our next question. The next questions come from Luca Giuseppe Solca from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Please ask your question.
Luca Solca
Managing Director
0:36:00
Thank you very much for taking my question. Buongiorno, Andrea. My first question focuses on the very significant creative environment that we have now in the industry with more than 15 brands launching on the catwalk with new creative directors. There's going to be a lot of new products hitting the stores, starting next year. Are you thinking about that? Are you sort of planning anything that could help you ensure your fair share of consumer attention? How are you at all thinking about the environment that could become more competitive?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:36:47
I think that this is what will happen. This is what I'm saying when I'm saying that the next six months will be a change. First of all, with all this can-can happening, I hope that we will also attract some traffic back. We will all be benefited by some more traffic, which I think we would all love. I think that much of this is also trying to help this industry to come back to be more desirable. Our fair share, I can tell you that during the shows, we had our fair share. I mean, we were not a novelty. We were not something new. We had our very similar fair share of contacts, gratitudes, happiness, and reactions to our shows. The first step of that was very positive. I think that we are very, very focused on the first six months of next year. Very, very focused.
Luca Solca
Managing Director
0:38:04
Understood. Thank you, Andrea. My second question is on eyewear. Prada, the Prada Group, together with Armani, is one of the two cornerstones of the EssilorLuxottica licensed business. EssilorLuxottica has been very proactive in coming to the market with new products. I'm thinking about smart glasses. Are you planning to innovate with them? What do you foresee in this important license of yours?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:38:48
What I can tell you is that Prada has always been on the forefront of innovation, and we will continue to be through all our partnership. Obviously, our partnership with Luxottica is paramount on this.
Luca Solca
Managing Director
0:39:14
All right. I will take that as an endorsement that you're about to do something new, possibly. My last question was on retail. Prada has been a pioneer in establishing high-profile flagship stores. I'm thinking of downtown New York or Monte Napoleone. Is it part and parcel of your strategy to potentially trim the long tail of stores and reduce the overall number of stores for the brand, also to beef up and build even more impressive and bigger stores in your flagship locations? Is that something that we need to take into account when thinking about your cost profile as far as supporting these stores is concerned?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:40:14
I agree with you. This is our thinking. Before, I was saying that maybe a year ago, we were also considering some increased numbers of Prada. Today, I think there is a remix. Our long tail is too long. On the other side, the benefits we are having, especially nowadays where we are including so much hospitality, we are including privacy, we are including love, these bigger places are what we need. We are working on at least five or six projects. On the other side, we're also working on trimming the long tail, as you were calling it.
Luca Solca
Managing Director
0:41:07
Perfect. Grazie mille. Thank you very much indeed, Andrea.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:41:10

We are now going to take our next question. The questions come from Thomas Vincent Chauvet from Citi. Please ask your question.
Thomas Chauvet
Managing Director
0:41:27
Good afternoon, Andrea. Andrea, thanks for taking my question. I have three. The first one on next year's customer service.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:41:38
We don't hear you. You're very disturbed.
Thomas Chauvet
Managing Director
0:41:42
Is it better now?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:41:44
Yes.
Thomas Chauvet
Managing Director
0:41:45
Apologies for that. Yes, sorry. Thanks for taking my question. I have three. The first one, I was looking at consensus next year where the market is expecting another year of slight EBIT margin pressure. I think 70, 80 bps. Andrea, you mentioned earlier the FX headwind on margins. Beyond that, it looks like the total OpEx next year is expected to grow at around 11, 12%. Likely to grow faster than sales. You talked about how your efforts are starting to pay off. I was trying to understand how you think about the major cost and CapEx plans for next year. You talked about retail earlier. Is there anything else that would justify another year of double-digit OpEx growth? That's my first question.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:42:35
Hi, Thomas. I wouldn't get into that now. I mean, let's talk about 2026, you know, as we always do when we reported the full-year results. Also, you know, consensus at the moment, I believe, may be not entirely accurate due to the fact that some may already have included Versace. Some others may have not. Let's, as I said, push this discussion to later. Let me reiterate again that, you know, vis-à-vis what we always said in terms of priorities, but also how we wanna handle our profitability, nothing new to report.
Thomas Chauvet
Managing Director
0:43:23
Thank you, Andrea. My second question on the Prada brand retail performance, and any color you could provide on, qualitatively, perhaps, on full-price stores versus outlets at the time aspirational consumer seem to be coming back in some geographies with the traffic improvement. Is that benefiting maybe a bit more your full-price stores? Any color on that would be useful.
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:43:51
The color I would give is that outlet for us has remained a bit of a drag. When we look at the retail overall performance, yes, bear in mind that full price is above the total number because you know the path that we took on outlets, and that has been continuing.
Thomas Chauvet
Managing Director
0:44:21
Thank you. Finally, on beauty, I think earlier this week, L’Oréal CEO said Prada had reached over €500 million in beauty sales only in four years, I think, after you began the partnership. I think it was 2021. How much bigger do you see the opportunity there considering Nicola Iannoni also said that Saint Laurent was achieving nearly €3 billion of sales, so six times more than Prada for a fashion brand, which is quite smaller than the Prada brand. It would be very helpful within the royalty line. You had €100 million in nine months, a very good number. I guess maybe €130 million annualized. Could you give us a very rough idea of the revenue split of that royalty stream between beauty and eyewear? I know eyewear is the majority, but what kind of majority, please? Thank you.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:45:23
The beauty market is obviously much, much bigger than the eyewear market. We have come to the beauty market probably as last. We're gaining huge ground. The launch of Prada, the new men's fragrance in August, September, has been a real hit and a real success. We're very happy of the partnership with L’Oréal. You should have asked the question to them if they see us larger than Saint Laurent in the long term or not. Having said that, we are constantly growing. We are not in a hurry. Luxury is patience. We love the work we're doing together. I think that we have a long journey of growth together. During Q3, I think we also launched the first Miu Miu fragrance. Even that was a Miu Miu team. Even that was a great success.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:46:31
The only thing I can say is we are very happy of the partnership with L’Oréal.
Thomas Chauvet
Managing Director
0:46:40
The split, perhaps, Andrea Bonini, anything you can share? Is it 80/20, 75/25 ballpark between eyewear and beauty, or it's something you don't wanna share?
Andrea Bonini
CFO
0:46:50
No, it's not something that we disclose. As you said, eyewear is a bit bigger, for sure.
Thomas Chauvet
Managing Director
0:46:58
Okay, only a bit bigger. Okay.

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got two ones. The first one is on pricing policy for next year. Do you expect the pricing increase in 2026 to be lower than in 2025 or similar? Do you plan differences among regions?
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:47:48
We have kept a kind of method, a rule, with two moments of the year where we do a kind of maintenance on prices and maintenance of differences between regions. I think we will keep on doing similar things in 2026.
Oriana Cardani
Equity Analyst Branded Goods
0:48:16
Thank you. My second question is on the growth by category in Q3. Which product categories grew the most in the quarter for Prada and Miu Miu? Thank you.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:48:39
On Miu Miu, the category which has grown the most, as I was saying before, we had a very balanced growth of product categories across the world and across products. I wouldn't argue too much. I would continue saying that, obviously, ready-to-wear is the cornerstone of Miu Miu. Similar on Prada, where we have seen an acceleration on leather goods. I think that this is the most important thing we have seen. Great resilience on the rest. We have seen a good growth and an acceleration on leather goods.

Liwei Hou
Equity Research Senior Associate
0:49:51
Good afternoon, Andrea and Andrea. I have only one question. Building on what you said, Mr. Guerra, China might not have as fast a growth as before. That's my understanding, with plateau. With that judgment, I wonder about Prada Group's future commitment to China, especially when the new generation comes in. More specifically, maybe I want to understand our license or lease agreement with Rongzhai. I've read about it. We have signed a 10-year agreement in 2011. I wonder, have we extended that? Are we going to continue to invest heavily in China, going forward? Thank you.
Andrea Guerra
Group CEO
0:50:43
You know, China is relevant. China has been always progressing and evolving during the last 15 years. It's not a 12 or 18 or 24 months that make your strategic plans change. Obviously, some CapEx may have been diluted, but nothing special. Rongzhai, our 17th-century building in Shanghai, has become, for Prada, it is, and it's becoming every day more our place, our epicenter. I would suggest every one of you, when you are in Shanghai, to go to the Prada café, to the Michelin café in Rongzhai. I would rate it the most beautiful café in the world.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Orange's Q3 2025 Results Conference. For your information, this conference is being recorded. During the Q&A session, in order to ask for the floor, please raise your hand in Teams. Please ensure that the mute function on your device is switched off to allow us to hear you when it is time for us to take your question. The call today will be hosted by Christel Heydemann, CEO, and Laurent Martinez, CFO, with other members of Orange's executive committee for the Q&A session that will start after the presentation. Thank you, and let me hand over the floor to Christel Heydemann.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:00:36
Good morning, and thank you for joining our Q3 results presentation. Before getting into our Q3 results, I would like to mention that last week, we submitted, together with Bouygues Telecom and Free (Iliad Group), a joint non-binding offer to acquire a large part of Altice France activities in France. In a challenging competitive environment, this deal would allow us to strengthen investments in France while maintaining a competitive ecosystem for the benefit of consumers. This non-binding offer amounts to €17 billion, of which 27% for Orange. There is no certainty that we will reach an agreement, and we are willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Altice France group. Back to our Q3 results, we remain fully focused on our business execution, and we are really pleased to report strong results driven by a robust commercial performance in France, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa region.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:01:35
In France in particular, we are proud to reaffirm our leadership in fiber, with over 10 million customers and plus 1.1 million new customers in the last 12 months. We have become the first operator in Europe to surpass this milestone in the domestic market, marking a major achievement in our state-of-the-art network commercialization. In Spain, Orange and MASMOVIL have announced an agreement with Vodafone Spain and GIC to create the largest fiber company named Premium Fiber. With 12 million premises and 5 million customers, this fiber core will provide considerable benefits for the Spanish market. Our continued focus on cost efficiency is reflected in the EBITDA growth of 3.7% this quarter, along with a 0.7% point improvement in margin rate. These robust results enable us to once again upgrade our full-year guidance, with a full-year EBITDA now expected to grow by at least 3.5%.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:02:41
Let's review our strong Q3 results on slide five. Revenues increased by 0.8% in the third quarter, driven by robust retail performance of 2.6%, which offsets the expected decline in wholesale. From a segment perspective, revenue growth is led by Middle East and Africa, achieving double-digit growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, and Europe back to growth thanks to retail services and IT and IS. In France, retail excluding PSTN grew 0.2% as expected and was offset by the anticipated decline in wholesale and equipment sales. EBITDA reached €3.4 billion, growing by 3.7%, giving us confidence to upgrade our full-year guidance to at least 3.5%. This growth is driven by our solid performance, as well as our continuous efficiency initiatives fueled by advancements in procurement, AI, and operational efficiency ambitions. In line with our eCapEx discipline, we maintain a CapEx to sales ratio of approximately 15%.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:03:52
I will now hand over to Laurent for the business review, starting with France on slide seven.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:03:59
Thank you, Christel. Good morning, everyone. In France, in a market which is overall flattish in value, the competitive environment remains generally stable, with sustained competition on the low end. In this context, we continue to uphold our efficient commercial strategy, grounded in extensive and innovative segmentation, strong customer loyalty, and value. This strategy led to a robust commercial performance, with 138,000 mobile net ads per quarter since the fourth quarter of 2022, 274,000 on fiber, and 20,000 on convergence. This performance is driven by increased momentum on Orange brand and effective churn management, with mobile churn improving by more than two points year on year. Convergence ARPO continued to grow, increasing by 1.1% year on year in the third quarter, while mobile and fixed broadband ARPO slightly declined year on year, reflecting the mixed effect related to the competitive landscape over the past year.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:05:08
Fixed broadband ARPO slightly improved on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Moving to the financials, for France, our disciplined and efficient commercial strategy led to 0.2% growth in retail ex-PSTN revenues as expected. Revenue continues to be impacted by the structural anticipated decline in wholesale. Globally, we remain committed to cost optimization and confirm our objective of growing EBITDA in France in 2025, slightly more than in 2024. Let's turn to Middle East and Africa, which continue to deliver a very strong performance, demonstrating once again our positive momentum. Revenues are up double-digit for the 10th consecutive quarter, driven by our four key drivers. Looking forward, on the back of this performance, we are fully confident in our ability to achieve double-digit EBITDA growth in 2025. Let's turn to Europe.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:06:15
Revenues are back to growth in Europe this quarter at 4.7%, driven by services growing at 1.4%, thanks to a balanced volume value strategy and an exceptional IT and IS quarter, notably in Poland. Net ads remain very robust in both mobile and fixed broadband, with mobile customer base reaching 22 million. Convergence revenue showed once again a strong performance, increasing by close to 6%. Looking ahead, we do confirm as well our 2025 outlook with a low single-digit EBITDA growth. Moving to Orange Business Services, revenues are impacted by last year's portfolio pruning, by the difficult IT market, and by the French macro environment. In that context, Orange's cyber defense growth remains solid at over 6% in the first nine months. In parallel, we are accelerating our transformation initiatives, focusing on growth areas such as sovereignty and security, while stepping up our efforts to optimize our cost base.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:07:27
Nevertheless, considering the complex condition of the global IT market and the French market macro environment, the ambition to have EBITDA decrease in 2025 versus 2024 is difficult. Let's complete with MASMOVIL Orange, our joint venture, which continues to create value with a strong focus on delivering synergies, which are close to our €300 million target by year end. In this competitive market, we achieved strong net ads in the mobile segment and maintained stable volumes in fixed. Revenues are up 1.7% this quarter. Services revenues benefit from strong growth in both B2B and our new business initiatives, which offset the negative mix effect in a challenging telco market. We have been as well able to close strategic alliances with tier-one partners in energy, insurance, and alarms.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:08:29
The positive momentum on equipment sales also fueled growth in the third quarter and is helping to extend the lifetime value of our customers. Lastly, we do confirm our outlook for 2025 for MASMOVIL Orange. Back to you, Christel, for the conclusion.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:08:48
Thank you, Laurent. I would like to conclude this presentation by confirming that our robust Q3 and nine month results make us very confident in reaching our objectives. In addition, reflecting our continued focus on efficiency and operational excellence, we are upgrading our EBITDA guidance to at least 3.5% after a previous upgrade in H1. Thank you for your attention. The floor is now open for questions.
Operator
0:09:15
In order to give time to everyone, please ask only one or two questions. As a reminder, to ask for the floor, please raise your hand in Teams. Please ensure that the mute function on your device is switched off to allow us to hear you when it is time for us to take your question. If we do not have time to take your question, then please contact our investor relations team after the call. As a reminder, journalists will have a separate Q&A in French at 10:30 A.M. Journalists, please stay connected after the presentation ends. Today, our first question comes from Akhil Datani from JPMorgan. Akhil, please unmute yourself and ask your question.
Akhil Dattani
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:09:55
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got two, please, if I can. The first is on French consolidation. Christel, you mentioned the non-binding offer that you as a consortium have now submitted to SFR. I guess the details are limited, but the one thing that stood out was that the % of the total transaction price that Orange will pay is 27%, which seemed higher than people might have assumed, given expectations that there are relatively small portions of SFR that you'd likely buy. Could you just start by helping us maybe understand at a high level how that price was determined and maybe any color you can give us on how we should understand what bits of SFR you could buy? You mentioned within that in your commentary that you are willing to engage with Drahi and the creditors.
Akhil Dattani
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:10:48
I just wondered if any sort of engagement has now kicked off so far. That's the first question. The second one, I guess, sticking with the event-driven aspect of these things, is MASMOVIL Orange. In the last few weeks, there's been a lot of speculation around your engagement with your private equity partners around a potential buyout of the 50% of the asset you don't own. Any sort of update on what is actually going on and what you can share? I guess more broadly, is there any sort of timeline we should think about by which when you would need to make this call and then alternatively move to an IPO process? Is there any sort of timeframe we can understand? Thanks a lot.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:11:33
Thanks, Akhil. On the French consolidation and the non-binding offer, I won't provide you more details on the split than what has been already communicated. As we've said, the B2B business would mainly be towards Bouygues Telecom and Iliad. We're looking at B2C spectrum and assets. We've done the estimates based on the level of synergies we would generate and based on what we could purchase. It's really a value-driven split. It's too early to provide you more comment given it's still a non-binding offer and we haven't reached an agreement with the seller, as you know. On the engagement so far, I won't comment. As you know, we made public the fact that we had submitted a non-binding offer given the importance of this transaction for the French market and for us, Orange, a listed company, and for Bouygues as well.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:12:48
Our main priority, we know we would like to move as fast as possible in a process for the seller to decide. They have different options. We don't expect to make public every single discussion we would have if we want to move fast. We know there's a lot of media attention. I mean, 50% shareholder in MASMOVIL Orange, we are planning and we are working on the strat plan, the financial plan for MASMOVIL Orange. As part of this discussion, we are fully in line with what's provided in the shareholder agreement. There's a lock-in period before an IPO can be triggered in April 2026. We are also investigating all other options. As we said, they always remain open. There's no specific timeline and there's for sure no rush for us to reach an agreement.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:14:07
Clearly, the discussions we have on the financial forecast for the company and the ambitions we both have for the company is probably what's generating a lot of media and speculation, I would say.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:14:22
I think just to add on the French side that, of course, the price that we would put is consistent with the asset and the value we would purchase, obviously.
Akhil Dattani
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:14:34
Great, thanks.
Operator
0:14:37
Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please unmute yourself and ask your question.
Andrew Lee
MD
0:14:47
Yeah, good morning, everyone. I had two questions. One was just to see if we can push a little further on, as Akhil put it, the event-driven opportunities for Orange. There's not much you can say on French consolidation. Could you just talk? You said obviously you want to accelerate or you want to move fast on French consolidation. Could you talk about your confidence in the approval process around consolidation more broadly in France in terms of both the EU competition authority approval and French authority approval and what's given you the confidence to launch this bid? If there are any timing implications around moving fast there. As a follow-up to that, just on the MASMOVIL Orange side of things, is the speculation around Spanish consolidation complicating the timeline to kind of you reaching a conclusion on what you plan to do with that asset? A separate operational question.
Andrew Lee
MD
0:16:02
In France, it looks a little bit like the competitive intensity at low-end mobile has spilled a bit into low-end fixed. Is that true? If you could just articulate what's going on there, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:16:20
Thanks, Andrew. On the French consolidation, first of all, as you know, there's a process where Altice France has been restructured and the owner actually wants to sell. That's the driver of all those discussions, number one. Of course, in that environment, we do believe that a French group of companies providing synergies is the best solution to create maximum value. Now, when it comes to the regulatory process, the political environment, it's really too early and we know that authorities will have to review that in detail. In any case, if you look at the option, which is a piecemeal deal on one side or a solution amongst other telcos, we do believe that not only our proposal is the best one to protect the intensity of competition, but also to protect the ability of the industry to invest.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:17:26
We know our networks require investment for security, for AI, and for resilience. We know the antitrust authorities are what they are. We know what happened in the UK with the CMA approval. We don't have any signal from antitrust authorities that they would approve such a transaction. We know, based on our experience with both Belgium and Spain, that they would review carefully. It could be EU or French processes. Actually, given we have three companies bidding for the main part of Altice France, it would probably be three antitrust processes. Depending on any of us, the three, it can be France or Brussels. Of course, antitrust authorities can decide to take the whole approach. There's no doubt that both authorities would work together, I would say, on the assessment.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:18:28
The main rationale for us on why this deal makes sense, first of all, it's something we've been pushing and we are absolutely convinced that Europe needs consolidation, national consolidation. When you look at the intensity of the competition on our mobile markets, the ability to create synergy and efficiency for us on mobile is also the ability to sustainably compete and offer low prices to consumers. That's really the driver and that's going to be the core of our explanation, I would say, with antitrust authorities. Not to forget that this is a French group of companies in an environment where we're talking about highly critical assets. Again, there's no certainty that this deal would be approved until it is. On MASMOVIL Orange, no, all the rumors and speculation on MASMOVIL Orange or all the speculation on what could happen in the Spanish market have no impact.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:19:33
I mean, we looked at the valuation of MASMOVIL Orange in a standalone, I would say, view. Of course, we work actively to improve, I would say, our position in the Spanish market. That's the reason why we signed and we launched Premium Fiber, because we know there's a lot of players. I do believe that consolidation in Spain will probably come first from smaller players. We know some of them. Some of them are actually partners of us. Clearly, the market in Spain remains super competitive and will remain super competitive for quite some time. The comment I was making on antitrust authorities for France would be exactly the same for Spain. We would not expect anything to happen soon or to be concluded to reach closing for MASMOVIL Orange. We don't take that into account, of course, for us.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:20:35
When it comes to the competitive intensity in France, the low-end market remains very competitive. It's true that in Q3, we've seen a number of entry price points increasing. We are more around the €10 for mobile. There's still Red, which is the SFR brand, cheaper than that. We've seen a €1, €2, €3 difference compared to what we had seen, especially in the end of Q1 and Q2. On broadband, there's also promotions for the low-end broadband, but the market remains stable compared to what it was before. Last but not least, you know how important our convergence strategy is. That's really for us the fuel and the growth engine in our retail market in France.
Andrew Lee
MD
0:21:36
Thank you, Christel. Very helpful.
Operator
0:21:42
Next up, we'll hear from Josh Mills, BNP Paribas. Josh, please unmute yourself and ask your questions.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research
0:21:51
Hi, guys. Two questions from my side, please. The first was just around Orange's group leverage. Would you be able to give us a bit of color about how you expect the SFR deal, if it goes through, to impact your leverage profile? Following on from that, does the leverage post the SFR deal still leave you with enough headroom to pursue other transactions, such as buying in MASMOVIL Orange, as an example? Somewhat related to that, given that the French consolidation deal, if approved, won't complete until the second half of 2027, how do we think about how this impacts your shareholder returns policy to be outlined at the Capital Markets Day in February? The second question for me is just going back to the operational performance in France.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research
0:22:35
I think last quarter you gave a bit more color on your expectations for how French service revenues ex-PSTN should develop. Obviously, it slowed down 20 bps versus last quarter. How should we think about this going into year end? Is there the chance that this is going to turn negative or do you still have the ambition of maintaining flat to slightly positive retail revenues ex-PSTN in Q4? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:23:02
Thank you, Josh. I'll start by your second question and then Laurent can comment on your first one. Operational performance and for Q4, we expect the same trend as Q3, which means flat to small positive growth, excluding PSTN for retail services. Really, same trend as Q3. On the group leverage, Laurent can comment. I think we've said before, it's very important for us. We know shareholder return is important and we have a leverage that allows us to be flexible. Of course, remaining investment grade is important. We think we have a solid balance sheet and we have the opportunity to carry several transactions.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:23:54
Yes, good morning, Georgios. Indeed, as you know, we have a very strong balance sheet. Of course, the potential acquisition of SFR will have some impact on the leverage, but it will create as well a lot of value, as we said, which means that this leverage will basically be smoothed on a relatively short period of time. Overall, we are confident that we can run both the MASMOVIL-Orange potential acquisition and our fair share of SFR purchase without, I would say, impacting the shareholder return, which remains for us a top priority.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research
0:24:38
Thanks. Maybe just one other follow-up, if I may. If we were to see the bid price for SFR change or increase over the coming months, is the agreement for the asset split between Iliad, Bouygues, and yourselves and the percentages given set in stone? Would there be the potential for certain operators to change the amount which they're buying and the assets which they are acquiring as part of the deal? How much flexibility is there on the 27% split you have today?
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:25:06
Thanks, Josh. You can be assured that the three of us have a very constructive dialogue and that's what we want to have with the seller. Obviously, I don't want to give you information that would jeopardize our ability to have the best negotiation in a transaction that's obviously very complex. As we said, we are value-driven in our approach. Each company, let's not forget that we have a very strict antitrust process and that this bid has been prepared, of course, with all the scrutiny and to be compliant with competition rules. All of us have our own models of valuation, but we also have such an experience and we know, of course, very well the French market. That's something we would be able to discuss, the three of us, with the seller.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:26:04
Again, a value-driven approach, which doesn't mean we're thinking of a mechanical negotiation for such a transaction with such impact on every three players.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Roshan Ranjit from Deutsche Bank. Roshan, you can unmute yourself and ask your questions.
Roshan Ranjit
TMT Equity Research Analyst
0:26:28
Great. Morning, everyone. I've got two questions, please. First question, just I guess in the context of any potential antitrust audience that we do get, can you remind us what % of your B2B revenues and total revenues you derive from France, please? The second question on the operational side. This was the second quarter where you have upgraded your EBITDA guidance, yet we haven't seen anything change on the organic cash flow level. Appreciate it is a greater than metric, but are there any other moving parts at the organic cash flow level? I know last year you absorbed a higher cash tax, yet still saw an upgrade, but any details you could give there would be very helpful. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:27:24
Thanks, Roshan. As you know, we do not publish the splits of our B2B between in France, but clearly, we have taken into account in our negotiation with Iliad Free and Bouygues Telecom the fact that when we have high market share, you can count on our competitors to try to get assets that would help them grow and increase market share. That's why the B2B part of Altice France would go to Bouygues Telecom and to some extent Iliad Free, not to us. We don't publish the split on B2B in France. On organic cash flow guidance, Laurent?
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:28:16
Yes. Hi, Roshan. Our guidance on cash remains valid above €3.6 billion of OCF. That remains valid. I just take the opportunity to state that within our 3.8% of EBITDA growth in France, we have 0.9 points coming from the bank, which are not part of our OCF, as you know.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mathieu Robilliard from Barclays. Mathieu, please listen carefully. In order for us to hear you, on your mobile phone, you need to press star six. Please press star six to unmute yourself and ask your question.
Mathieu Robilliard

0:29:11
Hopefully, you can hear me?
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:29:14
Yes, we can.
Mathieu Robilliard
Director
0:29:16
Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I had two questions. The first one was around Orange Business Services. You mentioned that the environment was tough and you have slightly, or you will maybe change the guidance or at least what you deliver. The question was a bit broader. Clearly, it is natural to see you lose a bit of market share on communication. I also understand that on IT, it's a competitive market. At the same time, we see a lot of growth for some services like cybersecurity, data centers, cloud, and obviously talks of increased need for sovereignty in Europe should be a positive for you. Maybe you could lay out a little bit where you see growth coming from at some point in the next future.
Mathieu Robilliard
Director
0:30:02
Also, if you could give a bit of clarity in terms of your data center exposure, maybe if you could give us a sense of what is the capacity you have in France and in Europe and how you expect that to grow. The second question, I was going to ask again about the potential SFR transaction. Just a point of clarification, because in the press release, you indicate that not all of the assets of Altice France SFR are concerned by the bid. I also note that in the French press, there was some reference that the offer that you were making for the assets represented an EBITDA multiple of around 6.6, which kind of suggests, if I'm getting my math right, that the value of the EBITDA that you are bidding for is around €2.6 billion.
Mathieu Robilliard
Director
0:30:53
Quite lower than what the trajectory of Altice France EBITDA suggests for the full year based on the H1. I don't know if you can give a bit of detail as to what you're buying. I understand, obviously, there's no French overseas. There's some service businesses of Altice France that are not included. If you could give a sense of what is the EBITDA as a whole you would be buying, that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:31:22
Thank you, Matthew. On the Orange business, clearly, there's, of course, the structural transition from legacy connectivity to next-generation connectivity. That's changing the nature of the services we provide, moving from a traditional telco to a more integration type of services. We are investing in our evolution platform, in really having a platforming approach for those services. Of course, cybersecurity is clearly, and by the way, next-generation connectivity is not a market that's declining. Of course, compared to the value of legacy, there's a value difference. Clearly, the next-generation connectivity is not a decreasing market. Cybersecurity, clearly, it's. Also, on cloud and data center, on cloud to start with, we are transitioning from some, so part of our solution has been in the pruning of the portfolio. We have some transition effect.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:32:32
That's clearly an area where we are investing on sovereign cloud, private sovereign cloud, public sovereign cloud with Blue together with Capgemini. When it comes to data center capacity, we don't provide details. We have capacity in all the countries where we operate, and we are investigating plans to accelerate in that field. We are not a pure player in data centers, so we are still thinking what should be our strategy. Not ready to provide you more details on this. On SFR, clearly, the list of assets is what has been published. It's very clear. It's everything in Altice France but the overseas business, XP Fiber, Intelsia, UltraEdge, and ATS, their field services unit. That's everything else.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:33:28
When it comes to EBITDA, bear in mind that for us, the valuation is both, of course, a multiple of EBITDA, which so far was based on the data we have, which is end of 2024, as well as our own assessment of synergies. Every of the three bidders has done its own assessed synergy plan. We've done our math, and clearly, the value comes from the synergies as well. It's not an easy, straightforward EBITDA calculation.

All right, great. If you could ask a couple on consolidation as well, please. On the argument, Christel, you mentioned the pro-consolidation argument it seems you're going to use is to protect competition. Could you just explain to us why you think cutting out a disruptive operator protects competition here? Are you arguing that Altice France wasn't sustainable? Maybe you could help us with that. Secondly, it's going to be up to the three of you to put together remedies. On the structural side, do you think there are any acceptable remedy takers left or do you believe the remedies, are you thinking this is going to be behavioral now post the CMA decision, for example? Could you help us a little bit with what sort of remedies might we have to think about? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann

Thank you, Nicolas. I won't say anything that would prevent our ability to run a smooth and open dialogue with antitrust authorities. Clearly, what we see and think of mobile consolidation, and we know that from our MASMOVIL Orange experience, where 18 months after closing, we are driving synergies that allow us to continue to compete on the low end as well as to compete on our A brand on the premium market. We are driving synergies and the market and the price point for consumers has not changed, on the contrary. In France, I think what we know is that we know exactly the amount of synergies that can be driven by bringing more mobile customers or broadband customers on our infrastructure. That's driving efficiency that in return allows us to continue to compete and to offer attractive price points for consumers while continuing to invest.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:36:18
Otherwise, you have to cut investments if you want to just continue to play in a super competitive market. Remember that we would then end up with three players in the market, two of them being stronger. Of course, our objective is to be the leader in France. Our two other competitors post-consolidation, if that goes through, would have more ability to invest and would have more ability to compete head-to-head with us. That is why we do believe that competition authorities should really look at it similar to what the CMA has done in the UK.

Stephane Beyazian
Equity Research
0:37:22
Okay, now we hear you. Sorry about that. Good morning. Two questions, yes, if I can. The first one is, can you update us a little bit on the cost savings? I'm partially thinking of the early retirement plan, where you are in this regard, and perhaps also the network shutdown. I think you were planning to launch a tender for the copper and have different contractors. I was just wondering where you stand on that as you continue to make progress in your cost cutting plan. The second question, coming back to the offer, I was just trying to clarify one thing. If you're contributing 27% to the bid, would it be fair to say that your share of the EBITDA of SFR is probably a little bit lower than that because you may be taking a bit more spectrum than some other buyers in the consortium?
Stephane Beyazian
Equity Research
0:38:29
Would that be fair? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:38:33
Thank you, Stéphane. I'll start with your second question. I won't provide you more details. Unfortunately, we don't want to speculate on what could be. Remember, this is only a non-binding offer at this stage and we haven't agreed with the sellers. I think it's really premature to provide you more details on that. The split of assets is exactly the one that has been shared in the press release. On cost savings, the early retirement plan is now open. It's been open for several months. The employees who are deciding on a voluntary basis to accept it, many have volunteered already. It's really executing as per plan. I don't know if Laurent, you want to comment on the various cost savings, procurement, and the copper RFP as well.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:39:33
Good morning, Stephane. We continue to move full steam on the cost optimization, and you refer to procurement. We are working on our €18 billion cost base to drive savings on this part. The copper contract is one of the major contracts on which we are working with Jérôme and the team in France, which is not yet decided. That will come for the next month. It is a jumbo contract indeed for the next four or five years. We will be, of course, eager to get the best value out of this contract to drive the strategic project for Orange France.

Good morning. Could you hear me?
Operator
0:40:31
Yep.
Ottavio Adorisio
Equity Analyst
0:40:32
Perfect. I have a few questions there for that, but let's first start from Spain. You basically recently monetized or announced the monetization of the fiber core, the JV between Orange and Zegona. Now, Zegona, the main asset they brought were the clients. Therefore, the monetization of the assets relied on the long-term commitment of Zegona clients to that network. Zegona has the habit of playing many different fields. It looks to be likely that the potential could be a target for Telefónica. I was wondering how difficult it will be for Zegona to move to migrate these clients, if there are any penalty fees in that particular deal, and can Zegona actually disentangle from that JV? The second point is on the credit ratings. You effectively reiterate that it doesn't really matter the two deals you're currently negotiating in Spain and in France. You still remain investment grade.
Ottavio Adorisio
Equity Analyst
0:41:42
That's true because basically you have quite large room. It's likely that potentially the BBB+ could be downgraded by one notch. Are you prepared for that or do you reckon that you have other levers to avoid that particular downgrade by one notch by the agencies? The third point is on the pricing. Pricing is domestic. You made a lot of comments on the fact that there is a lot of competition on the low segments, the value segments. I noticed that this quarter has been a bit different. It's not only been mobile where you've still got an ARPU that's going down around 4%. For the first time, I don't remember for how many quarters, you actually have a negative trend on the fixed ARPU.
Ottavio Adorisio
Equity Analyst
0:42:29
If you can comment on that one, do we expect the repricing on fixed to continue and to have a negative trend in the next few quarters? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:42:41
Thank you, Otavio. On Spain, with the implication of Zegona and Premium Fiber, be assured that, of course, we have long-term commitment from both, of course, MASMOVIL, Orange, and a third-party investor like GIC in such a transaction. That's really something that has been carefully taken care of. Laurent, the investment grade?
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:43:24
Hi, Otavio. On the rating, of course, early days, because we have as a... That is pure speculation, of course. Globally, we have a strong triple B plus rating. We feel that we have capacity to stick to this rating despite all of these potential transactions. It will all depend on the timing and the sequence of it. Globally, we are very confident that midterm will remain on this triple B plus rating that we enjoy today.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:44:05
On price competition in France, you're right that our ARPU for broadband is slightly declining compared to one year ago, but it's also slightly increasing compared to Q2. That's what we can say. I don't know if maybe Jérôme, you want to give more details on the pricing environment and what we've seen.
Jérôme Henique
EVP and CEO
0:44:30
Thank you, Christel. As you said, the environment remains quite stable on broadband, while it's more competitive on mobile low end in particular. What is very important for us is the convergent ARPU. As you reminded, convergence is our growth engine and our convergent ARPU is increasing by 1.8% at €78.6. On broadband, we don't see so much intensity on the competition, but it's true that some mid-range offers on the market and some promotions have been impacting the year-over-year ARPU, but still progressing on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as you said.

Thanks. Next up is David Wright from Bank of America. David, please unmute yourself and ask your questions. Go ahead.
David Wright
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:45:37
Hopefully, you guys can hear me. Thank you so much. Two questions, please. I think on both the Bouygues call and your comments earlier, you suggested the regulation could be separate processes, possibly even... I'm talking about, of course, the SFR deal, possibly even separate jurisdictions. I assume these are not mutually exclusive. If any one of those regulation approaches were to find difficulties or unreasonable remedies, I assume the entire deal would be off. Could there be any possibility, for instance, for Bouygues to separately buy the B2B business of SFR? I'm assuming any problem with any regulation on the whole deal is challenged. If you could confirm that. I am a little confused just on the French broadband pricing. I think you said... you said that the ARPU is obviously down a little more now. What is happening? Are you losing higher-value customers and adding lower-value customers?
David Wright
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:46:52
Are the higher-value customers migrating into convergence? I'm just trying to understand that mix effect. Those two questions, thank you very much.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:47:02
Thank you, David. On regulation, clearly, it's one proposal with three bidders, and our proposal cannot be split apart. Otherwise, it's not the same. Now, the regulation and the antitrust authorities would review case by case because they would review the impact for every one of the three companies separately. Of course, it's in a global approach to the market of what the Altice France sale would impact. Clearly, even though it could be reviewed by a different size or one per company, in the end, it's the assessment of one transaction and the impact for each company in the market. It's too early to say whether one authority would claim the leadership on the other one. What we know is that in any case for any transaction, when we were reviewing with Brussels the Spanish transaction, the Spanish authorities were reviewing carefully and remained involved by Brussels.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:48:12
In any case, we know that both teams would review carefully this transaction. On the French broadband pricing, clearly, as you know, we are gaining customers on broadband. We have indeed some of the new customers, that's why we call it the mix impact, have an entry price that's lower than the average ARPU that we had in our base. That's why you see a small impact on the base. You see the ARPU compared to Q2 and it's slightly increasing. We've had that impact in the past, so it's not really significant. We don't see a spin down of customers moving from high offers or premium offers to lower offers. Of course, we have some migration from pure broadband to convergent customers, and you see overall every segment of our customers is positive in net adds.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:49:17
All in all, we are adding more customers in our base, and the mix, that's what we call the mix effect, some of these new customers are coming with a lower price than the base. That's the impact on the average ARPU.

Ondrej, please unmute yourself and ask your question.
Ondrej Cabejsek
Equity Research Analyst
0:50:17
Hi everyone, good morning. Thanks for allowing me to take questions. I've got one follow-up and then a separate question on Spain. The first follow-up is basically on the shareholder returns policy, which obviously you said is a very important feature for the company. Over the past three years, we've had a feature within this, which was that every year the dividend was supposed to grow. I was curious, now that we only have a floor, you have more clarity into I guess the timing of potential deals and the potential amounts involved and therefore the impacts on your balance sheet. I was also curious to therefore see whether the kind of growth element of the shareholder returns policy is something that you will be thinking about as very important for the next three-year period. That's one question.
Ondrej Cabejsek
Equity Research Analyst
0:51:06
The second question on Spain, coming from a slightly different angle, you have been in discussions with Vodafone also around potential RAN sharing, which obviously would have a benefit to your CapEx and also potentially to Totem, I believe. I was just curious whether there is any update on those specific negotiations. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:51:31
On the shareholder return policy, I won't provide you more details. Of course, we know that's one item that we would cover as part of our 2025 results in February and our Capital Markets Day at the same time. Yes, you're right. We have a floor at $0.75, as reminded in our guidance. On Spain, we already have RAN sharing in some areas of Spain between Orange and Vodafone Spain. Nothing new on that front to comment on. Of course, when it comes to tower companies and Totem, actually, we have been negotiating, but that was part of our synergy plan. When we combine Orange and MASMOVIL, we have been renegotiating and working on the network synergies between the two companies. Also, as part of that, all tower companies in Spain have been contributing. Of course, Totem was already supplying Orange and the network of Orange has been maintained.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:52:47
Not much to comment on top of that. No, nothing new on the network synergies, I would say, beyond what we had already planned as part of the Orange and MASMOVIL transaction.
Ondrej Cabejsek
Equity Research Analyst
0:52:59
No progress on like the full RAN sharing project that's been kind of in the media in Spain?
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:53:06
I guess you're talking about some speculation around the creation of a specific vehicle where we would combine assets. Indeed, nothing. We have, as we are, which is we are sharing and we are using the Vodafone Spain network and they are using the MASMOVIL Orange network in some areas. Nothing has changed.

Emmett Kelly
Senior Research Analyst European and Global Telecoms
0:54:09
Okay, good morning, Christel. Good morning, Laurent. I've got two questions, please. The first question, please, is on consolidation and it's on the potential impact on towers. Can you say if there would be any impact on Totem Towers in France from a successful completion of the transaction? Secondly, just looking at the press release last week, you said that the non-binding offer is subject to several factors and one of these is the due diligence. As you get access to the SFR data room, what are you really looking for? Are you looking at the churn of the subscribers, the quality of the subscribers, the free cash flow profile of the business? Are you looking for areas of overlap where you can target cost reductions? What are your red lines there? Thank you very much.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:55:08
Thanks, Emmett, on the impact of any potential consolidation on the French market and specifically on Totem. Of course, given our view is that we would create more synergies, we would actually load our network with more customers. No impact foreseen. Every day our teams are planning for network evolution. As you know, part of the transaction is to solidify the ability for telecom operators in France to continue to invest. I think this transaction, on the contrary, would probably provide more ability in the long run for all players in the market to invest, which I see as positive for Totem. On the due diligence, nothing specific. This is really pretty standard what we look at for due diligence. It goes from the financials, but also everything that you can think of, but really standard. No specific, no red lines. It's really pretty standard.

Fernando Cordero
Equity Research Analyst, Executive Director
0:56:35
Okay, thank you very much. Two questions from my side. The first one in Spain, and particularly also on the potential consolidation scenarios. I would like to understand at which extent you would be interested in or you believe that MASMOVIL Orange would be, let's say, stronger if it would be regaining the full control on the mobile network. Today, it is having a RAN sharing agreement with Vodafone Spain. I would like to understand in which scenarios you would be interested in having full control of this RAN sharing agreement. The second question, also starting from Spain but ending in France, given that the operations in Spain are now putting a lot of focus on, let's say, services on top of connectivity, starting with devices, but also other services like energy, alarms, and so on.
Fernando Cordero
Equity Research Analyst, Executive Director
0:57:22
At which extent do you foresee this strategy to be potentially implemented as well in France? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:57:35
Thank you, Fernando. In Spain, on the network side and potential further market consolidation, we don't see, I mean, we cannot comment. As you see, we've created the Premium Fiber because we see the value of combining assets and making sure we bring more customers on an existing infrastructure. We have this similar rationale, very value-driven approach. When it comes to mobile network, we don't, I mean, as we said, nothing has changed. We leverage the Vodafone Spain network. They leverage our network. We are more looking for more synergies than trying to de-synergize amongst players, given the competitive intensity in the market. When it comes to diversification, a lot of the initiatives that MASMOVIL Orange has launched are actually already in place in France. We have been home security is a market we have launched a few years ago, insurance as well, content as well.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:58:48
Devices, I mean, equipment sales are actually part of the growth in MASMOVIL Orange. It is somehow applying the same rules that Orange Spain or the same recipe that Orange Spain was having from a marketing standpoint to the full MASMOVIL Orange scope. I think, of course, we keep on learning from things that MASMOVIL Orange is launching and testing in Spain. That's useful to compare and to benchmark ourselves also in France. This is something we have done already as well in France for quite some time.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:59:22
Fernando, we can add that around 8% of our retail services are coming from all of these adjacents. There is a clear path in terms of positive evolution on this. Indeed, we are cross-fertilizing with our Orange colleagues on these subjects.

Hello. Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First one on Orange Business Services. In the press release, you don't reiterate your target to stabilize the EBITDA in 2026. I wanted to check if you're removing the guidance for next year. The second question is on wholesale revenues in France. The decline is accelerating over the last two quarters at minus 9%. For the next quarters, should we expect the wholesale to come to a double-digit decline due to the acceleration of copper decommissioning? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:00:42
Thank you. On the Orange Business soft guidance, what we see clearly is that the overall market environment, be it the IT market or the French, I would say, macro environment, is highly uncertain. In that environment, our message is that it's difficult. The guidance we have is difficult, but we are not setting a different guidance at this stage. Of course, our strategic plan for Orange Business and our cybersecurity activity would be a core pillar of our next Capital Markets Day in February. We continue to drive with the same intensity our efficiency program, our transformation, our repositioning on the new portfolio. It's really more the overall market environment that's making the execution of the plan uncertain and difficult. It's not because we are slowing down on everything we've launched already. On the wholesale trajectory for Q4, Laurent, I suppose it's the same, but...
Laurent Martinez
CFO
1:01:51
Indeed, what we said, Eric, is that the second half wholesale evolution will be in line with the H1, same trend. All of that is definitely in line with our global guidance. You know, you remind of €1 billion revenue decline of wholesale between 2022 to 2025, so fully consistent with our expected trajectory.

Russell Waller
Equity Analyst
1:02:43
Thank you. Excuse me. Yes, good morning, everyone. I just had some questions on the offer to SFR, please. First of all, could you just explain why your offer excludes those assets that you listed? XP Fiber, Intelsia, etc. Why were they excluded? Would you consider changing your offer to bid for the equity so it includes those assets, for example, if that's what the seller wanted? Second question, obviously the offer was made in public. Can you just confirm that that's standard practice? For example, when you made the offer to MASMOVIL, were there negotiations in private first and then the offer was made in public, or did you just make the offer in public, as you did for SFR?
Russell Waller
Equity Analyst
1:03:30
Finally, could you just talk about whether or not there might be clawbacks or clauses included in the deal based on, say, the performance of the underlying asset at SFR? There are some people who have concerns that there's underinvestment or CapEx is low, for example, and you might buy an asset that maybe doesn't quite meet expectations. How would you protect yourself from that aspect? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:03:55
Thank you. On the overall transaction, and of course, I mean, the fact that we have a proposal coming from three players is not standard practice in submitting an NBO. Especially with two players listed and given the amount we're talking about, and the fact that we had officially submitted an offer, we thought, and that was also a legal interpretation. That's something we've disclosed and we've discussed with the market authorities. That's not something we decided on our own. That's really what has driven the press release on the proposal, even though indeed it's an NBO. At this stage, it's not the confirmation that we've reached an agreement with the seller. That's very clear. It's very early to comment on other things like a clawback clause or everything, because that would mean we have a final and signed agreement. Of course, that's something we would be happy to comment on.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:05:11
We hope on the day when we have a deal agreed between parties. That's not the case today. On the assets and some of the assets that have been excluded, XP Fiber, as you know, is owned 50% by Altice only, or 49% or 51%, I don't remember. Other players are involved and it's an asset that has been for sale for some time. Some of the other assets are really independent assets and very different from our telco business when it comes to call centers for supporting Altice. We don't think these are assets that naturally make sense for us to acquire. We don't think, by the way, that Altice would have difficulty to find to launch a sale process. Again, what we said is we believe our proposal is a good proposal. We want to be constructive and dialogue.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:06:09
I don't want to anticipate any conclusion that would be reached. I don't want to put words in the mouth of Altice. That's for them to assess what they want to do.

President and CEO
0:01:44
Thank you, Jeff. I appreciate everyone joining us today. I couldn't be more excited to join you today for my first Ideal Power Results Conference Call. As many of you know, my new role was announced last week. That said, I want to touch on a few things before handing the call over to Tim Burns. We look forward to your questions after our prepared remarks. I'd like to briefly discuss why I took the role at Ideal Power, and then I'll discuss my approach and near-term plans. First, why did I take the CEO role here? Ideal Power has created a compelling and customer-validated solution addressing secular high-growth power applications emerging in the data center, industrial, and automotive markets where power efficiency, power density, and cost are key requirements. There is a multi-billion dollar addressable market for our B-TRAN technology.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:02:41
With the ongoing electrification of our society, we are commercializing our technology at an opportune time by delivering innovative and enabling power semiconductor solutions for a broad array of growing and B-TRAN-enabled applications. Obviously, I have high confidence in Ideal Power, or I wouldn't have joined. I want to commend and thank my predecessor, Dan Brdar, for his leadership and strong contributions in guiding the company to where it is today. Second, I see Ideal Power as a technology innovator with its B-TRAN technology that enables inherent advantages in delivering ultra-low conduction losses, improved power efficiency and power density, and bidirectionality, all on widely deployed low-cost silicon. These are competitive differentiators as we begin to commercialize our B-TRAN solutions with customers. Third, I believe I can help Ideal Power to accelerate its commercial opportunities.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:03:45
I know Ideal Power's markets from my more than 30 years of experience in the semiconductor industry, spanning a variety of end-use markets, including data centers, industrial, and automotive. I plan on leveraging my extensive commercial experience and relationships to drive revenue growth in our target markets. Revenue is a priority. I'm sure you are wondering what I plan on doing or what you should expect from me. Having joined Ideal Power just last week, I'm spending time getting my hands on the details of the business. During the next several weeks, I will be listening closely to feedback from our customers, distributors, suppliers, and the outstanding team here at Ideal Power. Because I'd like to be highly visible with customers, both existing and prospective, I'll be meeting with them to understand their priorities, opportunities, and requirements, and listen to their feedback about our technology and their applications.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:04:44
I'll review our opportunities, progress, roadmap, and strategic initiatives. Those discussions will deepen my understanding of our business and enable me to fine-tune our vision and strategy going forward, building on the strong foundation that is in place today. Upon completion of that process, I anticipate scheduling a call and webcast to share more detailed information and discuss certain topics in greater depth, including my perspective for product commercialization. Before setting expectations, I want to take the necessary time to thoroughly understand the current state of our business. As an organization, we will strive to execute in all aspects of the business with rigor, discipline, and a strong sense of urgency. We will endeavor to execute on what we communicate and not put ourselves in a position to have to reset expectations. It goes without saying that this is important to establishing and maintaining credibility. One thing is abundantly clear.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:05:47
With a strong foundation in place from which to drive our future growth, I'm not going back to the drawing board. We're well-positioned to drive long-term value creation for our customers, suppliers, employees, and stockholders. In closing, I look forward to partnering with Tim Burns, our CFO. I'd like to recognize the entire team for their third quarter progress and results. I'd also like to thank my predecessor, Dan Brdar, for assisting with the transition and providing a strong foundation for our growth. I'm thrilled to be joining Ideal Power at a time when the company has such exciting opportunities ahead. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tim Burns to discuss our recent progress. Tim?
Tim Burns
CFO
0:06:34
Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Since David just started last week, I'll share an update on our progress since the start of the third quarter. First, we secured a purchase order from Stellantis in late August for custom development and packaged B-TRAN devices targeting multiple electric vehicle applications. We successfully completed our first of five deliverables under the purchase order in late September. The remaining deliverables are expected to be completed next year. Second, we expect Stellantis to award us with a multi-year EV contactor program. As part of the program scope, Stellantis has told us they want to install B-TRAN-based contactors in Stellantis test vehicles potentially as early as late 2026. We'll know more about the scope and timing specifics as we work through the program details with Stellantis in the coming months.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:07:29
This program has broad and substantial potential as Stellantis recently shared with us that they are evaluating the deployment of B-TRAN-based contactors across all of their EV models and platforms. Third, we are engaged in early discussions with the sixth global automaker. This automaker is evaluating B-TRAN for next-generation high-voltage EV power switching and protection applications where bidirectionality and low conduction losses enable more compact, reliable, and efficient vehicle and charging architectures. We will share further updates on this opportunity as the engagement progresses. Fourth, our first DesignWin customer has successfully completed testing of the updated solid-state circuit breakers that we provided them during the third quarter. We're currently working with them on the finalization of their product design as they prepare for end-customer sampling and production. Fifth, we shipped additional solid-state circuit breaker reference designs to large potential customers, including a global power management market leader in Asia.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:08:36
Reference designs are an important part of our commercialization strategy as B-TRAN is a new technology and customers are eager to get hardware in their hands that demonstrates the advantages of B-TRAN in their target applications. Sixth, we increased the power rating of our discrete B-TRAN product by 50% and commenced shipment of these devices with a higher power rating and power density. This development has sparked greater interest from both existing customers and new prospects in our sales pipeline as it aligns well with the market moving to higher power architectures for many applications. Seventh, we continue to expand our global reach, adding our first direct salesperson in Asia. He's already conducting face-to-face meetings with current and prospective customers. Interest in B-TRAN is growing across Asia, which is the world's largest market for power electronics.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:09:28
We're excited about the opportunity for B-TRAN in this region as Asian companies typically adopt new technologies faster than their European and American counterparts. Eighth, third-party automotive qualification and reliability testing of B-TRAN devices is well underway with more than 1,000 packaged B-TRAN devices from multiple wafer runs. Early test results are positive with zero failures to date. As a new semiconductor device without a long operating history, third-party reliability testing and the data it generates is key for both industrial and automotive customers as they evaluate and adopt B-TRAN for their applications. Moving on to the initial market for B-TRAN, the industrial markets, and in particular, solid-state circuit protection for data centers, microgrids, industrial facilities, and grid infrastructure. Our first DesignWin customer is one of the largest circuit protection equipment manufacturers in Asia, serving data centers, industrial and utility markets, and renewable energy applications.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:10:28
As we have previously mentioned, and based on the first DesignWin customer's projections, the initial product from this customer could translate to several hundred thousand dollars of revenue for Ideal Power in its first year of sales, with the opportunity to exceed $1 million in revenue for us in the second year of sales. Importantly, this marks only the beginning. The initial product is anticipated to be the first of multiple products from this customer that will incorporate B-TRAN into solid-state circuit breakers. This customer provides a variety of circuit breaker products across various power ratings, and it is expected that they could expand their portfolio to add a full family of solid-state circuit breakers at ratings similar to their current family of electromechanical breakers.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:11:10
Discussions of other B-TRAN-enabled solid-state circuit breaker products have already started, and our team recently built the solid-state circuit breaker prototype with a higher rating to share with this customer. Looking briefly at innovation, we increased the power rating of our discrete B-TRAN product by 50% and commenced shipment of these devices with a higher power rating and power density. This development has sparked greater interest from both existing customers and new prospects in our sales pipeline. Our approach to power ratings of our products is deliberately cautious, an approach that has been well received by our customers as we bring new solutions to their markets and applications. As we accumulate more testing hours and go through additional reliability testing, including the ongoing third-party automotive qualification testing, we are finding that we have more than ample margin in our design to increase the power rating of our products.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:12:00
Elevated product ratings will expand our SAM to include additional applications. It will also strengthen our product's competitiveness in the marketplace as it translates to smaller, lower-cost OEM products for customers that choose B-TRAN as their power semiconductor solution. We previously mentioned that orders near-term are not dependent upon the successful completion of automotive qualification. However, achieving third-party automotive qualification would provide additional confidence among industrial customers regarding B-TRAN's long-term reliability. It would also provide evidence of the device's reliability under extreme conditions, such as high humidity and temperature, which exceeds typical industrial application requirements. Additionally, given that engineers tend to be cautious when adopting new technologies, achieving automotive qualification could help accelerate the adoption of B-TRAN-based products by early adopters in our initial target industrial markets. Our B-TRAN patent estate continues to grow. Currently, we have 97 issued B-TRAN patents, with 47 of those issued outside the United States.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:13:05
Our patent coverage spans North America, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, India, and Europe, all representing our high-priority patent coverage geographies. As a result of our continued innovation, our list of pending B-TRAN patents is now at 73. To safeguard our intellectual property further, we treat the proven double-sided wafer process flow we developed to make our devices as a trade secret and do not disclose the identity of and work under strict confidentiality with our wafer fabrication partners. Even if a competitor studied our patents, they would not have the know-how to fabricate the device. Next, I'll discuss our financial results. Our third quarter 2025 cash burn from operating and investing activities was $2.7 million, up from $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 and up from $2.5 million in the second quarter of this year.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:14:03
Our Q3 cash burn was at the lower end of our guidance of $2.7 million-$2.9 million. Our cash burn from operating and investing activities for the first nine months of 2025 was $7.4 million, up from $6.6 million in the first nine months of 2024. We continue to manage expenses prudently and aggressively. We expect fourth quarter 2025 cash burn to be approximately $2.5 million-$2.7 million, with a full year 2025 cash burn of approximately $10 million. This compares to a 2024 cash burn of $9.2 million, excluding the benefit of warrant proceeds. The higher forecasted cash burn in 2025 compared to 2024 is due to increased semiconductor fabrication spending and hiring. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $8.4 million at September 30th, 2025. We have no debt and a clean capital structure.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:15:01
We recorded modest revenue for the third quarter of 2025 as customers continue to evaluate our technology. Initial orders from the large companies evaluating our products for potential inclusion in their OEM products will be small, with order sizes increasing as customers start to prototype their OEM products, progress through their design cycles, and build inventory for the rollout of their B-TRAN-based products. Operating expenses were $3 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, with the increase due to higher wafer fabrication costs at our second foundry. We expect operating expenses to increase modestly in the coming quarters due to recent and future hiring and costs associated with our development and commercialization efforts.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:15:47
We also continue to expect some quarter-to-quarter variability in operating expenses, particularly our research and development spending, due to the timing of semiconductor fabrication runs, product development, other research and development activities, and hiring. The timing of equity grants and related stock-based compensation expense recognition will also cause variability in our quarterly operating results. Net loss in the third quarter of 2025 was $2.9 million compared to $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. Considering our asset-wide business model, no debt, and modest planned cash burn, we have sufficient liquidity on our balance sheet to fund operations through at least mid-2026. We'll potentially see several sources of funds over the next year, such as product sales, development agreements, and other commercial agreements with upfront payments. Additionally, we are exploring strategic relationships with our well-capitalized and large global partners, with these opportunities strengthening as we further advance these customer relationships.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:16:49
As a publicly traded company, we also have access to the capital markets as necessary, providing us with additional financial flexibility. At the end of September, we had 8,511,403 shares outstanding, 824,760 options and stock units outstanding, and 653,827 pre-funded warrants outstanding. At September 30, 2025, our fully diluted share count was 9,989,990 shares. In summary, we are thrilled to share that our first DesignWing customer has successfully completed testing of the updated solid-state circuit breakers and are now finalizing their product design as they prepare for end-customer sampling and production. We are also delighted to announce that not only securing the purchase order from Stellantis for custom development and packaged B-TRAN devices targeting multiple EV applications, but also completing our first of five deliverables under this purchase order.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:17:51
Overall, it is an exciting time at Ideal Power, and I look forward to working with David to capture the significant market potential for B-TRAN as an ultra-low-loss and bidirectional power semiconductor. At this time, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator.
Operator
0:18:07
Thank you. At this time, we are conducting a question-and-answer session. Investors can submit their questions within the meeting webcast by typing them into the Q&A button on the left side of your viewing screen. Analysts who publish research may ask questions on the phone line. For analysts to ask questions on the phone line, please press star one on your phone keypad. For anyone using speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before you press the keys. Please wait a moment whilst we poll for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Casey Ryan of WestPark Capital.
Operator
0:18:52
Casey, your line is live.
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:18:53
Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. David, welcome. It's great to have you on board. Tim, thank you for this good update. I just wanted to start with generally automotive. It feels like the opportunities are with EV platforms and the growth of those platforms generally. I just want to sort of confirm that for myself before we go a little further. Yeah.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:19:22
Thanks, Casey. Glad to be on the call, and I appreciate the question. Automotive is one of multiple markets that we're able to sell our products into, where it has a strong fit to the application's requirements. As you understand, automotive is also one of the longer development cycles, and projects are typically multi-year programs.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:19:46
We continue to work to, I would say, move from the initial engagement through continued evaluation, where we've made progress now in delivering enhanced products to our customers. We've continued multiple stages of the development programs, and each of those is a necessary step in moving towards completing the R&D evaluation of the products and qualification, then moving into series engineering and eventually landing into vehicles on the EV side.
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:20:18
Okay. Terrific. And then sort of on that EV track, what's driving the automakers to look for better solutions than, say, what they have currently or what they've had previously? Because generally, they must be facing some limitations with sort of existing solutions. Is it battery density or the power of the amount of electronics per vehicle?
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:20:47
I'm sort of happy for it for Ideal Power, but I'm curious what's sort of driving it and what sort of barriers they're running into with sort of their current solutions. Of course, you guys are bringing a better solution to market. One of the fundamental trends in power electronics is a move to higher power architectures. One of the fundamental ones in EV architectures is the adoption of 800-volt main battery systems, which is driving a redesign of the overall architecture and traction inverter, charging systems, contactors, battery disconnect units, and so forth. That's the reason for continuing to evaluate technologies that provide higher power efficiency, improved power density, and manage the cost.
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:21:36
Okay. Terrific. Then sort of quickly on charging stations, which I think is also a potential market for Ideal Power.
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:21:47
I think charging stations are also moving to 800-volt systems, right, which might cause the same sort of trend where people would be interested in your solution.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:21:54
Yeah. Fast DC charging stations actually continue to increase the power to multiple kilovolts. It gets partitioned out across multiple terminals. It does present an opportunity for us. Also, in some instances, particularly home charging, there is bidirectionality involved where you can feed into the battery pack and then off-hours feed out from the battery pack back in that distributed power. That is unique to the design of our B-TRAN technology.
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:22:27
Okay. Terrific. That is really helpful. I wanted to ask about the Asian, I think, power management company is what we are talking about them as a customer.
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:22:38
It sounds like, and Tim, you said sort of a couple hundred thousand dollars might be kind of a target range for potential revenues in year one. What I wanted to ask was, is the product currently available for sale, hypothetically, today, or will it start to go on sale to the commercial market sometime in 2026?
Tim Burns
CFO
0:22:58
Yeah. It is not currently for sale. They are finalizing their product design. We are working with them to do that right now. I do not know the specific timing, whether it will be here later this year or whether it will be next year. That is something we can cover here when we have the update call in terms of timing. They have the updated prototypes. They have completed testing. It was successful. Those prototypes look good.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:23:25
We're just waiting for them to share a little bit more on their timing specifics as it relates to their rollout plan. Yeah. I mean, from my perspective, what's significant, right, is going from concept to testing to sort of turning into a commercial product, having completed that cycle, I think, is really impressive.
Casey Ryan
Director of Research
0:23:42
That's it for me right now. Thank you for the terrific update.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:23:48
Thanks, Casey. Appreciate it.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:23:49
Thanks, Casey.
Operator
0:23:50
Thank you very much. I will now turn this call back to Jeff Christensen to read questions submitted through the webcast. Thank you.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:24:00
Thank you, Jenny. Gentlemen, the first submitted question is, any additional context around the CEO transition? Is this something that was planned for?
Tim Burns
CFO
0:24:12
Yes, Dan's retirement was planned. There was an extensive search that was conducted and led by our board that Dan was involved with to identify our next CEO.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:24:24
That resulted in us bringing David on board. I'm actually really excited, particularly because of his vast experience in semiconductors and commercial expertise, that it's a great time to bring him on because I think it will really help with what obviously is our priority and what's on investors' mind in terms of revenue generation.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:24:42
Thank you. Our next submitted question is, how do you see the markets evolving? This is a question for David. How do you see the markets evolving, including data centers, industrial, and automotive? What are you most excited about with Ideal Power opportunities?
David Somo
President and CEO
0:24:59
Okay. Casey alluded to part of this question, but I'll give a more thorough answer here.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:25:07
Our B-TRAN-enabled solutions, from my perspective, excel in high-power applications delivering lower conduction losses for improved power efficiency, smaller system size for improved power density, bidirectionality, and enabling lower systems cost. Power levels have continued to trend up, as I mentioned a moment ago, across these applications, including the AI data center, which is now planning a move to 800-volt rack architectures, commencing sometime in 2027, automotive EV with the adoption of 800-volt battery systems and fast DC charging terminals, as well as other industrial infrastructure applications as the power grid is enhanced to support these growing applications. In addition, grid-to-system and system-to-grid power transfer requires bidirectionality, where there is also a growing trend to migrate from electromechanical to solid-state semiconductor-enabled systems. Each of these major technology trends involve applications such as circuit breaking and protection, UPS, and battery disconnect systems, among others that B-TRAN solutions excel at enabling.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:26:22
In summary, we can see a continued trend towards higher power levels across these multiple applications, looking for improved power efficiency, improved power density, and managing costs that are all a strong fit for B-TRAN technology.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:26:40
Thank you. Our next submitted question is, do you expect the initial sales ramp and milestones to be achieved within 2025?
David Somo
President and CEO
0:26:51
Having been in the seat here a total of eight days, I'm currently spending my time deepening my understanding of the details of our business. Once I've been through that process, including the opportunity for face-to-face meetings with key customers to understand thoroughly the details of the engagements that we have with them, I anticipate scheduling a call and webcast to share more detailed information and discuss certain topics in greater depth, including my outlook for product commercialization.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:27:28
Revenue is a priority, and I plan on leveraging my go-to-market experience achieved in my 30 years in semiconductors across many end sectors and customers to drive revenue growth in our target markets. Thank you. We have several investors that have submitted questions, and please submit your questions using the ask-a-question button. As you think of questions, submit them. You do not need to accumulate all your questions and submit it at one time.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:27:59
Our next submitted question is, what is Ideal Power doing to expand the sales pipeline?
David Somo
President and CEO
0:28:05
Yeah. As discussed in our prepared remarks and shared by Tim, we have added direct sales in Asia and are already conducting meetings with current and prospective customers. We are excited about the opportunity for B-TRAN in the region as Asian companies generally adopt new technologies faster than their North American and European counterparts.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:28:30
While we continue to expand the sales funnel, we have a strong focus on closing the many opportunities available to us from current customer engagements. Having the additional sales capability on the ground in Asia is important to us, and we view it as a market that can actually move faster in adoption of new technology than some of the others. Thank you. How would you compare B-TRAN to competitors, including silicon and silicon carbide solutions? Yeah. I think about it in this way. B-TRAN has two significant advantages. First, it has ultra-low conduction losses, meaning the higher power efficiency and improved power density. Second, it is bidirectional. These advantages translate to more power-efficient and compact customer products at lower cost compared to alternative silicon and silicon carbide power solutions that are in the market today.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:29:32
Okay. Thanks.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:29:38
Can you provide us with any additional information on tier ones and OEMs besides Stellantis in the automotive?
David Somo
President and CEO
0:29:44
Yeah. So we're engaged with several automotive OEMs and tier one suppliers, as we've previously said. These prospective customers are considering a range of applications that include power switching, EV contactors and battery disconnect units, charging systems, and inverters. With the automakers increasingly moving to the 800-volt architectures, as I talked about earlier in my comments, the opportunity for us in this market is expanding. At this point, it also seems likely there'll be a replacement of electromechanical contactors with solid-state solutions in EVs.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:30:25
Okay. Thanks. Our next submitted question is, when mentioning EVs with Stellantis, is either the drivetrain or contactor program likely to be included in hybrids?
Tim Burns
CFO
0:30:39
Yeah. The Stellantis program is really focused on electric vehicles, but our technology would bring the same benefits to hybrid electric vehicles.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:30:50
We're obviously engaged with several global automakers, several tier one automotive suppliers. I assume once we start getting adopted in EVs, the hybrid is also a natural extension of that. There's definitely an opportunity there for B-TRAN. Thank you.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:31:07
Our next submitted question is a long one. Just to understand, you upgraded the power rating to 75 amps. You stated in the release that this maintains a significant design margin to a tested long-term continuous basis of 150 amps. What does that mean? Would you at some point in time increase to 150 amps, or would you have to test it at above that at a safe design margin? Is there a standard margin that the industry uses, and how does the 75-150 margin fit within the standard?
David Somo
President and CEO
0:31:45
Sure. I'll take that one. You can think about it in the following manner.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:31:48
Increasing our power rating enables customers to evaluate our B-TRAN solutions for a wider range of applications, as well as increase the power rating while lowering conduction losses of existing applications in their current designs. There isn't a specific industry guideline for safe design margin. However, we remain very conservative in rating the device at 75 amps, and we've tested it up to 150 amps. We want to ensure that we're providing the proper safety margin to our customers, and that varies by customer and by applications. I would say that we have sufficient headroom to continue to scale the device up for higher power solutions as the trend continues in that direction.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:32:34
Thank you. Our next submitted question is, please provide any color on where we stand with manufacturing.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:32:44
Yeah. We have two foundries. As we've mentioned, one of them is in Europe.
Tim Burns
CFO
0:32:51
One of them is in Asia. We've been working with the Asian foundry for a little bit longer than we had the European foundry. I'd say they probably are still ahead of the European foundry in terms of things like yield. We're comfortable that we could utilize devices from either one for end product sales to customers. We also have a great relationship with two packaging houses, one that we're using we'll use primarily for production. That's actually in Asia and one here in the U.S. that we also continue to do some development work with that we could use for production if necessary, for instance, if we received a government program that required U.S. manufacturing. Overall, I think we're in really good shape. Right now, it's just about commercializing the technology.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:33:39
Thank you.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:33:40
Our next submitted question is, what are the main barriers to closing sales?
Tim Burns
CFO
0:33:46
Introducing B-TRAN, with it being a new semiconductor technology and device structure, begins with educating the customers. Engineers are generally familiar with IGBTs and MOSFETs, but B-TRAN features innovative and distinct architecture that functions differently from traditional semiconductor devices. To help our prospective customers evaluate our products for their applications, we provide evaluation kits and reference designs to simplify this undertaking. Additionally, engineers often adopt a cautious approach, which can extend the evaluation period. Achieving automotive qualification, as we mentioned during our prepared remarks, will help to speed up adoption by demonstrating the technology's proven long-term reliability for their applications.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:34:35
Thank you. Our next question is, how should investors think about tariffs and trade policies on Ideal Power?
David Somo
President and CEO
0:34:46
Yeah.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:34:48
We continue to see that the tariff situation is very fluid, but we anticipate minimal impact on our operations from tariffs in place today. Notably, power semiconductors are often exempt from many of these tariffs, which really limits the potential effect on us. While the situation continues to evolve, we're confident that we're well-positioned to manage and mitigate the impact of future tariff changes, trade policy shifts, and also supply chain disruptions. Thank you.
Jeff Christensen
Head of Investor Relations
0:35:23
That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to David Somo for closing remarks.
David Somo
President and CEO
0:35:29
Thank you, Jeff. I want to thank everybody for participating in today's calls and for the good questions. As I mentioned earlier, we anticipate scheduling a call and webcast in advance of our year-end results call to share more detailed information and discuss some of the topics explored today in greater depth.
David Somo

Good afternoon and welcome to Banco BPM 9 month results conference call. We have here Giuseppe Castagna, our CEO, and Edoardo Ginevra, Joint General Manager and CFO, which will take us through the presentation. This will be, as you know, followed by a Q&A session, and I kindly ask you to limit yourself to two questions. Now I'll hand over to Giuseppe.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:00:59
Thank you, Arne. Thank you, everybody, for being with us for this Q3 presentation. Let's start immediately on page six of our presentation. We wanted to show you just a full picture of what we are doing, and how we are delivering our vision that we announced with our business plan in February this year. We think we have completed almost the product factory activity that we started two and a half years ago with the bank insurance, payment system, life insurance, and recently asset under management. This brought us already quite a relevant set of results. Let's say almost EUR 400 billion of total customer financial asset, 49% of fee-based generated models, so non-NII revenues on total revenues. Strong reduction on NPE ratio, 2.48% gross and 1.4% net, and maintaining and building up again a strong capital position up to 13.52%. Profitability is growing as we expected.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:02:21
We have now reached an ROTE of 22%. Vis-à-vis 16% of 2024 and 14% of 2023, with an ROE which stands at 6.5%. In terms of shareholder remuneration, we can confirm that the board has approved the distribution of EUR 0.46 per share. To be paid in November and later in November, on the 26th of November. This month. Representing 80% interim dividend for 2025. If you can make a comparison with the previous dividends starting from 2022, you can see the growth that we are having considering like-for-like results: EUR 350 million in 2022, EUR 850 million in 2023, EUR 1,100 million excluding the extraordinary distribution for the Numia one-off in 2024, and already EUR 700 million in 2025. Total shareholder remuneration during this year is 565%. The dividend yield that we will pay will be 7.3% on a yearly basis. Net income stands at 1.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:03:51
660 billion, well on track towards our guidance, common equity ratio at 13.52%. Again, as you can see, excluding one-off, we are 17% higher than last year's results, and we have already reached 85% of the total guidance we gave for this year. We will come back to that. Net income was very strong, EUR 450 million, considering the seasonality of August. One of the best quarters, third quarter in our story. This pace, we deem, is fully consistent with our long-term targets. In terms of the commercial performance, new lending was 39% higher year on year. Asset under management net flows was EUR 1.7 billion in nine months, compared to EUR 700 million of 2024. The cost income stood at 45%, down from 47% nine months 2024. Again, cost of risk reduction to 34 basis points, compared with 40 basis points last year. The interim dividend.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:05:22
Has a yield on six-month yield of 3.6%, and again, has been approved today, will be paid 26th of November. We have already accrued EUR 170 million. In the first nine months of the year to be distributed between the interim and the final distribution. Economics are very solid, both in terms of growth in revenues, 5% stated vis-à-vis last year. If we consider the performance, the contribution on Anima, we increase these results by another EUR 120 million. We already said that non-NII revenues stood the performance at 49%, very close to 50% of the target in 2027. As well as net fees and commissions rose 18%, including the contribution of Anima, but performing also the first quarter of Anima, this will grow of another EUR 140 million. Also, the contribution from income from associates, insurance, NFR increased from EUR 140 million to EUR 290 million. In line with our expectation for 2027.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:06:52
In terms of cost control, we were able to reduce again the cost income to 45%, with a reduction of 2% like-for-like vis-à-vis 2024, and just a slight increase if we consider the Anima inclusion of cost. Significant decline in provision from 30% year on year, from EUR 350 million to EUR 244 million, with a cost of risk going down from 40 to 34 basis points. Capital, if we consider the acquisition of Anima and the regular headwinds, we were able to build up 152 basis points in terms of organic generation through managerial action. After paying 240 basis points out of the Anima transaction and 60 basis points for regular headwinds, and including, of course, also 200 basis points that we will pay as dividend, 80% dividend payout. On page 10, let's have a look to the trajectory towards our target in 2027. As we already said, net income.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:08:27
Grew in terms of quality of the contribution. You remember that we switched our bank from a pure commercial banking activity to a more equilibrated and more capital-light activity, diversified activity. We had the target to grow from 24% to 35% as a contribution in terms of wealth asset management and protection. We are already at 33% after nine months from the target decision. The same is for specialty banking contribution. That is almost in line with the minimum target of 2027. The reduction of commercial banking activity, which went down from 65% to 57% with a target of 50-55%. The quality. These results were driven by non-NII revenues, again growing from 40% to 49%. Cost income ratio reducing from 47% to 45%, cost of risk down to 34 basis points. In terms of numbers and the different contribution of the main area.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:09:57
Vis-à-vis the current results and the target, we have still. We are fully in line with our expectation. We still have a delay of EUR 30 million per quarter in terms of NII, which we will easily reach through the refresh or replicating portfolio in the next couple of years. The decreasing cost of wholesale funding, which is already contributing more than EUR 40 million per year, and the growing commercial volumes, which we expect in terms to up to EUR 3 billion by the end of the business plan. Net fees and commissions, still we have some growth to expect from the full speed of the different product factory, including, of course, Anima contribution and improvement in the running fees. Also, we expect some improvement from insurance business.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:11:04
You may remember that this year we had two IT migrations for both life and non-life business, which impacted on our results and also on the payment system activity with Numia. Meanwhile, we are still, we are experiencing a very strong growth in terms of fees coming from corporate investment banking, Banco Agros, trade finance, and we expect this to continue to grow for the coming two years. In terms of cost, both operating cost and cost of risk, as we anticipated, are well on track. Cost of risk is below the target we expected, so we have an advantage that would help the final target that we have in terms of net profit. Very confident to reach our target. Let's have a look to Q3. We wanted to dedicate a slide to the Q3 contribution. We are very satisfied of our EUR 450 million of results.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:12:14
On the right side of the slides, you can see. The profit before tax, which stood at EUR 685 million in Q3, which, you know, has normally. Deflated by seasonality. The difference of EUR 70 million coming from the Q2 results is due essentially only to the Monte dei Paschi di Siena dividend that we included in Q2. Meanwhile, the seasonality has been partially recovered through organic improvement expected in fees and lower cost. Very solid result for Q3. Let's have a look to the nine months. Net interest income down 8%, but if you consider net interest income at full funding cost, which means including the cost of certificates, which are, of course, a source of funding for our bank, we go down to 5.7%. Core revenues, although experiencing a reduction of EUR 225 million in NII vis-à-vis the nine months 2024.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:13:35
Have an increase of 1.6 as total core revenues year on year. If you include the net financial result and other operating income, this advantage vis-à-vis last year grew to 5%. Operating cost, meanwhile, registered a 2.2 increase due to the Anima impact. If we consider year on year without Anima, on a like-for-like, is a reduction of 2% in general cost. Provision down 30%, leading to a net profit from continuing operation and net income one-off down. Better 17% vis-à-vis last year. On the right side, you can see the trend of this last two year with continuous improvement, which are very encouraging for the remaining growth that we have to experience by 2027. As you can see, revenues grew 13%, almost EUR 550 million in two years. NII at full funding cost registered this year is at the same level of 2023.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:14:56
Notwithstanding a new EURIBOR, which is 106 basis points below the average of 2023. Cost income down, cost of risk down. Let's pay some attention to net profit from continuing operation, which is EUR 1.5 billion. Compared to EUR 1.1 billion of 2023, is EUR 440 million more. Also after considering almost EUR 200 million reduction of NII. So that means that we had a profit generated by a strong increase in fees and a very strong reduction in general cost and cost of risk. We already mentioned NII. Let me just say that the reduction we had has been offset for EUR 84 million by managerial action out of EUR 100 million that we expected by 2027. We are also, in this case, at a good point. Now we have almost the same spread asset liability in the region of 145 basis points. We are.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:16:28
Consistently taking advantage from the bonds issue spread, which has been reducing 40 basis points, generating lower cost in terms of NII for EUR 41 million per year. You have some example of the different kind of bond issued by the bank of the strong reduction we are experiencing since the previous issuance that were strongly higher in terms of spread vis-à-vis the current situation. We also may give you some figure about the replicating portfolio, which now stood at almost EUR 28 billion. We have to refresh by the end of the year and the next year for a total consideration of something like EUR 9-10 billion that will improve also the general yield and the contribution to NII. Notwithstanding, we were able to have an increase in new lending of 39%, exactly 57% in mortgages and 44% to non-financial corporates. The full level of our.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:18:07
Stock remaining basically the same. As you know, we are not registering an increase in loan demand. Although we are confident that by 2026, having kept the level of loan at the same level of the beginning of the year, we can register a strong increase that is testified by the good activity we are having in granting new loans. We are taking, of course, a lot of attention to the quality of our portfolio. Stage two loans reduced EUR 1.6 billion to below EUR 9 billion. Now our non-financial corporate portfolio is 53% secured, 64% if you consider only small business. 92% of our stock is concentrated in the best risk classes, and the same level is up to 98% if we consider the new lending of the first nine months of this year. Let's go to page 16. Total net fees and commission up 3%.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:19:30
Which would be performed at 5% if we exclude the contribution of EcoBonus and instant payments. Last year. Of course, the stated figure is much higher because it includes the contribution given by Anima, which is up to EUR 1.8 billion. And if we include the full consolidation of Anima starting from January, this figure is almost EUR 2 billion. The investment product fees grew 10%, mostly in upfront fees, but with a good contribution of also running fees in line with the growth of investment product placement, which after nine months stood at EUR 17 billion vis-à-vis EUR 15 billion of last year. EUR 17 billion was realized, notwithstanding EUR 2.3 billion of issuing of BTP by our bank. Let's say that also in October, we are continuing this strong production, and also in October, we have increased by another EUR 2 billion the investment product sales.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:20:46
For other fees, we have a reduction which is driven by the commercial bank activity, the two business lines I mentioned before, especially EcoBonus and instant payment, which went down EUR 35 million year on year. Meanwhile, we are growing almost EUR 40 million in terms of fees generated by corporate investment bank, structure finance, and trade finance. Very strong results. Let's have a look to the contribution of Anima. On the left, we have the growth in terms of total asset generated by the bank standalone. Also, in this case, we wanted to give you the progression of the last two years. We grew basically EUR 20 billion in less than two years, from EUR 210 billion to EUR 230 billion, with a growth year to date of EUR 3.4 billion in terms of asset under custody, EUR 2.4 billion in asset under management, EUR 2.3 billion in terms of deposit.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:22:00
These, of course, are excluding consolidation of Anima. In terms of net inflows, we grew EUR 1.7 billion versus EUR 7 billion last year. On the right side, you have the consolidation of Anima. We increased EUR 230 billion to almost EUR 390 billion vis-à-vis EUR 377 billion of end of 2024. A strong increase also in terms of Anima asset contributed to the bank. On page 18, up on the left side, you see the main feature of Anima, which we consider a first-class network, which is still performing consistently well. We have on the right the outstanding commercial and financial results, a growth in asset under management of 2.4%, namely EUR 2.5 billion in nine months of asset under management net flows, excluding the insurance mandates. In terms of revenues and net income in nine months.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:23:18
Compared to nine months 2024, we have an increase of 11% in terms of revenues and 50% in terms of net income generated by Anima. Cost income ratio down to 45%. As you can see, like for like, we have a reduction of 2%. Meanwhile, we have a stated or with a small increase of 1%, driven by the Anima inclusion. The staff cost was down again, like for like, 1%. Still, we have some further advantage that will be generated in Q4, even though mostly offset and compensated by the new labor contract and hirings that we are still having in order to offset the exit of the early retirement scheme. We will have another EUR 40 million of reduction next year generated by the early retirement scheme ended December 2025, but part of that, of course, will be offset by the new hirings.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:24:36
Also, other administrative expenses and DNA are down 4%, like for like, and other administrative expenses standalone are down 7%. Cost of risk at a very good level of 34 basis points, driven by ineffective credit management over the life cycle. The gross total NPEs went down from EUR 3.2 billion to EUR 2.5 billion, the net from EUR 1.7 billion to EUR 1.35 billion. The net bad loan ratio is as low as 0.4% of total loans. If we included also the state guarantee, this figure goes down to 0.1%. The share of the cake between UTP and bad loans is 80% UTP and 20% bad loans. We already mentioned the reduction in stage two. Let's see some figure that generated this 34 basis points of cost of risk. First of all, default rate down to 0.8%. Cure rate up from 4% to 6.5% with a net default rate, which was.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:26:09
As much low as 0.7% from 1%. The coverage is increasing both in terms of total coverage to 45.7%. As total NPEs with vintage in terms of years, which has been reduced from 2.5 to basically 2.1 years. If we include the state guarantee, if we exclude the state guarantee NPEs, we have an increase in bad loans to 77%. In UTP to 43%, and in total NPEs 55.3%. Let me pass the floor, give the floor to Edoardo for some figure in terms of net financial results.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:26:58
Thank you, Giuseppe. Very quickly on the financial contribution to capital and the financial part of the balance sheet contribution to capital and to P&L.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:27:11
Capital-wise, we are at a contribution which is from reserves at comprehensive income that remains at EUR 330 million, similar to last quarter, a significant improvement versus the value at the beginning of the year, which was negative for EUR 500 million. Allowed this improvement. By the active management of the bond portfolio. In terms of stocks, the situation is that we have EUR 47 billion, similar to what we had, slightly above, EUR 47 billion, similar to what we had three months ago. Also the split between comprehensive income and amortized cost did not change, 32% as opposed to 68%, with the slight increase of the comprehensive income versus the beginning of the year. Share of Italian GOVIS on total GOVIS is below 40%, which is our risk appetite threshold, so very well under control. Contribution to P&L, as I was saying, is positive for EUR 97 million.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:28:26
Bearing in mind that in this P&L line, we have to offset the negative contribution from certificate, which is as high as EUR 129 million this year, down from EUR 29 million, EUR 20 million, EUR 20 million in the nine months of 2024. With a positive impact from the reduction in rates, as also shown in the first part of the P&L of this presentation concerning the overall contribution of NII at full funding cost. Rest of NFR of trading is EUR 226 million positive through the year, benefiting not only from MPS dividends, but in general from the active management of the bond portfolio. Page 22. Liquidity is at EUR 54.7 billion, so almost EUR 55 billion, increasing again this quarter and from the beginning of the year, which was EUR 48.4 billion. Total direct funding increased, especially for the contribution of retail deposits, which of course gives interesting.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:29:48
Perspective in terms of interesting outlook in terms of positive potential P&L. Contribution, NII contribution. We have continued actively our activity in the market for insurance, being the first Italian bank and the second in Europe issuing in October a green bond under the EU green bond fact sheet. Insurance activity has been also encouraged by the positive evolution of our rating position with positive outlook assigned by Stanford, Pulse, Moody's, and Fitch, and an upgrade by the BRS to BBB, BBB high. The BRS also has assigned a first A-level rating to the bank recently in October. Very positive, reassuring also the position for the liquidity indicators. LCR at 157% and NSFR stable at 126%. MRL buffer at 7.8 percentage points of the total. So very significant level of the buffer. 23 for capital. Page 23 for capital. As.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:31:12
Mentioned in the first part of this presentation, capital creation from the beginning of the year has been 152 basis points after taking into account more than 200 basis points of dividends. In the last quarter, the progress has been of 20 basis points, which is 12 basis points from the difference between positive performance and accounting for additional dividends, 20 basis points from our source of capital that constantly gives contribution, which is DTAs and reserves for value of comprehensive income. In total, 13 basis points negative from the expansion of the books in terms of RWA increase. On the contribution from DTA in comprehensive income, we confirm that this will be important also for the rest of our plan horizon, with 145 basis points as shown in the bottom of this page, materializing between now and end of 2027. MBA Buffer quite comfortable now above 400 basis points.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:32:45
Fifty basis points above the minimum threshold of our plan. Let me conclude. Let's recap these very strong first nine months of the year. I have to remember that during the year, our bank was also under some pressure, I would say, but notwithstanding that, we were able to almost complete the target for this year, the guidance for this year. Let's say that we are increasing profitability through the non-NII related business, benefiting from our unique product factories model. We are continuing strong and efficient cost discipline. We have built up an excellent asset quality, which reflects the footprint and the geography of our branches. All in all, we were able in one year to increase the ROE adjusted and the ROTE adjusted. Adjustment means without one-off Anima contribution for 2025, one-off Numia contribution for 2024.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:33:58
Up to almost 200 basis points in terms of ROE and almost 550 basis points in terms of ROTE. This, notwithstanding the NII impact, due to the reduction of EURIBOR from 3.6% to 2.2%. We consider these very strong results and already on top of our target in 2027. Having already said of the capital position, the capability to build up further capital over the next quarter, we were able to approve the EUR 700 million distribution for our shareholder to be paid on 26th of November, with an increase of 15% year on year on the interim dividend distributed in November 2024, EUR 0.46 versus EUR 0.40 last year, with an annualized expected dividend yield set at 7.3%. In terms of cumulative remuneration after 18 months, we have already.
Edoardo Ginevra
CFO
0:35:14
Deliberated and will distribute EUR 2.2 billion in 18 months, fully in line with the over EUR 6 billion we expect for the full duration of our business plan. Some hint on the guidance, we already said that we prefer to leave the guidance at the level we announced, EUR 1.95 billion. Whatever will be the accounting treatment of the fiscal impact that we'll have, and we don't know yet which kind of impact, but we are pretty sure that having already reached 85% of the target we wanted to achieve in 2025, we will be able to leave this guidance, whatever will happen in terms of fiscal impact this year. That's all, and now we will leave the floor to the Q&A session. Q&A session, sorry.

Equity Research Analyst
0:36:41
Good afternoon to everybody. I have two clarifications. The first one is on slide 23. You mentioned the 145 basis points of organic capital generation that I interpret as deriving only from the release of DTA and the fair value reserve in the next two years. Is my understanding correct? Is my understanding correct that out of these 145 basis points, around 60 basis points are from the securities on fair value on other comprehensive income? That is my first question. The second one, again on capital, I was wondering whether you plan to complete some.

Let me first confirm that we are finalizing an SRT transaction, which we plan to complete in the next few weeks, so before the end of the year. For the capital creation from DTAs and fair value comprehensive income, this 145 is what is expected to come as additional capital in the quarters between the next quarter, 2026 and 2027 in total. You asked what is the split between DTAs and fair value comprehensive income. DTAs are around 120. The rest is fair value comprehensive income pull-to-bar effect.

The next question is from Manuela Meroni, Intesa Sanpaolo. Please go ahead.
Manuela Meroni
Equity Analyst
0:39:10
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the guidance of 2025. You confirmed your $1.95 billion guidance, but considering what you have already achieved in the nine months, this embeds a fourth quarter significantly weaker compared with the third quarter. On the other hand, you are guiding for a stabilization of NII and fees up on a quarterly basis. I'm wondering if there are some reasons to be so prudent on the fourth quarter, what you are expecting there. The second question is on the dividend. You have already a 13.5% common equity Tier 1, so well above your 13% minimum threshold. You have these tailwinds from DTA and fair value through the OCI.
Manuela Meroni
Equity Analyst
0:40:12
I'm wondering if you might consider to increase the payout above the current level. Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:40:20
Thank you, Manuela. Let me be more precise on that. Of course, we think that we will reach the guidance, as I said before, whatever will be the final accounting principle to regulate the fiscal impact that we are still waiting from the government to deliberate. Let me be a bit prudent, but also, let's say, on the other way, a bit aggressive in saying that even though we should be obliged to put the potential amount into profit and loss, we feel that we can be able to still respect a figure in the region of EUR 1.95 billion, which I think was not expected. I did not hear from anybody else such a possibility. On dividends, of course, as you may remember, we were.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:41:22
Very much questioned about the possibility to be above 13%. In the first three quarters, we have generated a lot of capital. We are respecting 80% of payout. Still increasing to 13.5. Our common equity R1. Let's say that still we are below our peers. So let's wait for the end of the year to understand which will be the capital generated by the bank in the next couple of quarters, and then we can discuss increasing the remuneration or the payout. Okay.

The next question is from Sophie Petersen's Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Sophie A. Last
Executive Director and Counsel
0:42:15
Yeah, thank you. Here is Sophie from Goldman Sachs. My first question would be on net interest income. In terms of the trough, we saw weak volumes, but new production is very encouraging, and also lending margins are stabilizing.
Sophie A. Last
Executive Director and Counsel
0:42:35
Do you think we have reached the net interest income trough, or do you think that's still ahead of us? My second question would be on M&A. If you could just talk about your kind of thoughts around M&A. The press has been talking about Credit Agricole, Italy. Any comments you can make here? Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:42:58
Let me talk about NII and then Giuseppe on the M&A section, which he wanted to start earlier. On NII, consider that in our plan, we have a guidance of, we have a target of slightly above EUR 3 billion for 2026, which we believe that at this point is confirmed with a scenario of EURIBOR at 2%. We announced already that we would be able to absorb small shocks on the scenario, but basically, we do not see reasons why we should change this target.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:43:53
This assumption on EURIBOR, given the market evolution that we are facing at this point. We expect, as described in slide 10, that this is the basis to achieve a higher level of NII and to hit our target in 2027. With a mixture of actions that will provide contribution from the financial part of the portfolio, and this is replicating portfolio and decreasing cost of wholesale funding. To give you an idea, we have EUR 27 billion replicating portfolio. The target is EUR 25 billion, which is where we expect to stay on average next year. These EUR 25 billion are paying currently a level that is some 20 basis points above EURIBOR for a pure mechanical effect of time lag on the repricing and the readjustment. If EURIBOR stabilizes, this mechanical effect will disappear, and 20 basis points on EUR 25 billion is around EUR 50 million. Similarly.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:45:11
Benefit from issuance of wholesale funding, we have EUR 5 billion of new issuance per year, and. In the next. In a total of EUR 10 billion, which is the average over two years, including issuance of the second part of this year and issuance and half of the issuance of 2027, a benefit of 50 basis points leads to an improvement down the line of around EUR 50 million. Commercial volumes, just look at the spreads, which are quite similar on the asset and on the liability side, means that every EUR 1 billion, either of grossing loans or of grossing deposits, will provide us with an improvement of some EUR 15 million, 1.5% in terms of P&L. Deposits are growing at an excellent pace. Have been growing at an excellent pace throughout the last few years.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:46:16
Loans is the next challenge, but we believe we are very well equipped to restart in growing the loan book. Once our clients will restart, we will revamp the investment process. Maybe on. Thank you, Sophie. Let me just give some color to your question. I think we have shown this year to be able to respect our guidance, also considering unexpected headwind as we are having. On top of that, we managed this year to cope with the Anima acquisition on one side, and, let's say, to be obliged to stay under a hostile OPS for nine months with our network. We had to cope with two IT migrations and two bancassurance deals, and the integration of the product factory we have built up in the last year. A lot of work to do, reaching always strong results. The same we have for 2026.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:47:36
Of course, we are not scared of taking one eye on reaching our target for 2026 and also considering any opportunity coming from the market in terms of M&A. We are not. In this moment, of course, we have nothing in mind. We are not dealing with any transaction, but we know very well that there are some stakeholdings, either in our bank or our stakeholding in other banks, that could generate during 2026 some potential M&A. I think we have to consider our standalone plan and the capability in any situation, in any market situation, to respect our plan on one side and the possibility to deal with opportunities that we showed that we were able to do together with reaching our results. Attentive to anything happen on the market. We are not many left in the market, but still with a lot of opportunity.

The next question is from Luis Brandas, Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Luís Pratas
Senior Equity Research Associate
0:48:59
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. My first one is on NII. We saw a much slower quarterly reduction this quarter in the customer spread. Compared to, let's say, Q1 and Q2. Do you think we are close to the bottom in the customer spread, and how do you see the spread going forward split by the asset and liability spread? My second question is on the Anima minorities. I wanted to hear your latest thoughts on how you plan to deal with the minorities. Do you have the goal to own 100% of Anima and delist it? Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:49:38
Thank you, Luis, for the two questions. Let's say, yes, we think we have reached the bottom, both in terms of asset spread.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:49:51
Of course, the same, I think, is also in terms of liabilities. We don't think we can, with EURIBOR, which is now quite stable. Again, I want to stress, especially the work we have done on the asset spread, because on the liability, I think we dealt very well with the spread. On asset, as I mentioned before, we managed to maintain the same level of stock with a strong increase, almost 40% of increase in new loans generation, which, of course, had a good boost for our commission. In a situation in which loan growth was zero or minus zero, because we are not having loan growth in our country. Thanks to our geographic footprint, we were able to stand at a very good level of new loans, maintaining the situation, and, sorry, bettering the quality of this credit book with a lot of.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:50:59
Guarantee taken also with the opportunity of the guarantee state scheme. This, of course, in a situation in which loans are not growing and we are willing to better our quality, of course, you can lose some few basis points, which is what happened to our portfolio. We feel, as I also understood that my colleagues think that in 2026 there will be a recovery in terms of investment. If this happens, as historically happened, our bank will be in the best situation to take advantage from that. With a growing, even though not blooming, but growing market in terms of loans, I think also the asset spread will increase. Second question about minorities. I always say that we are going to buy Anima in order to make Anima greater. We want to have our distributor of Anima.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:52:14
We think there is an opportunity to have some other banks joining the group of distributors, and we want to leave room for also giving a stake in Anima to this new distributor. Until this situation will be open and we will have the opportunity to manage some contact with other banks, I think we will leave, for the time being, the stock listed, but I hope that quite soon we will understand what will be the opportunity for the next quarter. Give us some time to experience the opportunity of having somebody else on board, and then we will decide what to do with the stake.

Hugo Cruz
Banks Analyst
0:53:18
Hello. Hi, thank you for the time. My main question is around dividend, the final dividend for 2025.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:53:28
If I understand your dividend policy, is you net out the gain on the revaluation of Anima. You already raised the interim larger than last year. So even if you beat the guidance on earnings, it sounds like the final dividend will be lowered year on year. Is that something you're comfortable with or not? A second question. Why are you not seeing loan growth? You're in the most dynamic part of Italy. Some of your peers, at least in the past quarter, have shown loan growth. Is that too much pricing competition, and you don't want to compete there? Because at system level, there is that you're starting to have loan growth for the whole of Italy. Why shouldn't you be doing better than the system when you are in the better part of the country? Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:54:21
Thank you, Hugo.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:54:27
For the first part, yes, of course, with the one-off of Anima will not be considered. We announced that with our business plan. Of course, if we will beat the guidance, the dividend will increase, and our effort will be to give a dividend which would be as much as possible in line with last year, in which we included the Numia one-off contribution. Let's say that like for like will be much better this year. We will decide, depending also on this fiscal impact, how to increase further this contribution. Let's say that when we announced the 6-plus billion in four years, we already said that, of course, there would have been an increasing dividend distribution in the last part of the four years, increasing, of course, also the profitability.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:55:29
We are perfectly in line, and hopefully, depending on the unexpected situation, we can try to also increase the contribution. On the loans, we think we are doing better because we are basically maintaining our loans at the level they are. Meanwhile, I think there is some reduction in loans for other banks. Notwithstanding, it is the best part. Unfortunately, investments are still lacking. The geopolitical situation, the uncertainty on tariffs have been very persistent during the year, and we still, now, in the beginning of November, are not having strong signals of recovery. Being the third year in a row, we really are confident that some recovery there could be. In this occasion, I am sure we will be better than others in recovering and increasing our loans.

Ignacio Ulargui
Iberian Banks Analyst
0:56:45
Thanks very much for the presentation and for taking my questions. I have two questions. One is on fees. I mean, do you think that whatever is not fees from specialized activities within the other fees bucket have probably bottomed at this level, and we could see some recovery into the fourth quarter thanks to seasonality? The second question is linked to Monte dei Paschi stake. If you could just share with us a bit of your thoughts on the stake going forward. Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:57:15
Okay, just a minute. I'm getting to the page. Yes. We were mentioning about the product factories because we have three categories: commercial banking and other product factories, which means consumer credit, payment system, and PNC insurance. The last one is from corporate investment banking and trade finance. Which one you are precisely?
Ignacio Ulargui
Iberian Banks Analyst
0:57:52
I was just referring to the.
Ignacio Ulargui
Iberian Banks Analyst
0:57:56
Commercial banking and other fees and product factories, which, I mean, if I just look into the year, they have been relatively flattish. Whether that could be, you see, that could recover into the year-end.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:58:10
Yeah. We think that there will be basically everything which is not included in product factories and in corporate investment banking and trade finance activity is on the other, which means current account, commission on loans, other commission on payment activity, money transfer, and so on, is included in that. Last year, we had also a strong contribution from the discount of fiscal credit. You know that in Italy, we had such a possibility to discount the fiscal credits, the famous super bonus or eco bonus. And together with the commission that we were able to.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
0:59:01
Get from the instant payment, which now are not anymore possible to apply, there is a reduction of almost EUR 35-40 million. The others are doing well, especially, of course, on loans, because, as I said before, we were increasing 40% the new loans activity. All in all, we think that like for like, we are increasing. The commission also on the commercial banking, and this will stand also for the next quarter. For the other, as I mentioned before, the one from specialized activities are doing very well. Meanwhile, we have registered some reduction in the bank insurance because of the immigration I was mentioning before, both in the life activity and in non-life activity, which will not have any more, of course, going forward in the next quarter. This is for the first question. The second question. Go back to the problem of we're talking about.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:00:12
Delisting Anima until we do not understand exactly what will be. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, as you know, is a strong contributor in terms of distribution of Anima. We had, in the past, some talks about the possibility for them to continue this activity, also getting possibly some interest in being shareholders. We will see after that what the final word about our stake in Monte dei Paschi di Siena.

Delphine Lee
Equity Research Analyst
1:00:52
Thank you for taking my questions. My first one is on the Italian bank taxes. I know it is still being discussed, but just wanted to kind of have your thoughts, your initial thoughts on how much that impact could be. My second question is on M&A. Credem has already commented that they are not considering selling their subsidiary in Italy. Just kind of wondering what other forms.
Delphine Lee
Equity Research Analyst
1:01:31
This M&A potential could take. I mean, would you consider more partnerships with Credem in asset management or in other areas, which I think is something that they would be keen on? If you could just share your thoughts here, that would be great. Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:01:47
Yes. Thanks for the question. On bank taxes, there are various, of course, items that are interested by the law or the project of law, which has not been, as you know, approved yet. In the current scenario, we expect to have a one-off this year of payments, sorry, of levy that is in the order of magnitude of around EUR 100 million, and this is a one-off. For the next years, the scenario is not clear, but we expect this to be affordable in the margins of flexibility and buffers that we will have in our plan.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:02:43
Once the real amounts and the technicalities of taxes will be clarified, then, of course, we will have to take care of planning the impacts and potentially adopting measures to counterbalance these impacts. We do not believe them to be a real changer versus our targets. Okay. Let's go back to M&A. You were mentioning CASA does not want to sell, but we never talked about buying the network of CASA, and we never talked about having anything else with CASA other than being a happy shareholder of our banks. We are not aware of anything happening in terms of possible merger. We will see what happens. They also requested to increase their stake to ECB. They have not yet received the authorization. Once they receive the authorization, they will decide the stake to take. Of course, we will understand better what could be.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:04:00
The possibility of having some more collaboration with them. Up to now, there is nothing at all. I read the speculation about buying the activity in Italy, but there is nothing in course.

The next question is from Adele Palama, UBS. Please go ahead.
Adele Palama
Equity Research Analyst
1:04:22
Yes. Hi. Good evening. Two questions. One is a clarification on the capital impact. So 145 basis points does include also the impact that you were expecting in the business plan from the securitization? If I remember correctly, you were guiding for 48 basis points from synthetic securitization. How much of that 48 basis points has been already taken? How much is left? And if it is included in that 145 basis points? If you can give us a guidance on the other provision and provision for risk and charges, because this quarter, you reported positive numbers there.
Adele Palama
Equity Research Analyst
1:05:18
I'm just trying to understand a little bit the gap versus the target, which seems a little bit conservative for full year 2025. And then on cost of risk, which is the guidance for this year? Because, again, I mean, you have reported around 35 basis points. But then if I try to bridge with your target, it looks like that you are expecting some additional extra provision in the fourth quarter. Is that right? Which is the guidance there? Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:05:57
On capital, thanks for giving me the opportunity to clarify. The 145 basis points that we showed, that we mentioned in page 23 of today's presentation, is only the impact during the plan horizon from DTAs and fair value comprehensive income. Securitization transactions are on top and will continue to provide the contribution that we have announced in the plan.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:06:40
By the way, we are already delivering on that. Taking into account the fact that in the plan, we said 48 basis points, including the effect of amortization of existing ones. In general, in this quarter, we did not have securitization since the SRT transactions. As I said earlier, answering to the previous question, we will have impact in the fourth quarter. In general, we will continue to generate capital through this lever also in the next few years. Normally, the high-level guidance, I would say, is that we do two to three transactions per year, and we have an impact of each transaction of around 10-15 basis points on average. Part of this impact is eroded by the amortization of existing ones. For cost of risk guidance, we always say that this year would have been below 40 basis points. We can confirm.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:07:49
We do not expect extra cost provision in Q4. As I mentioned before, we have a 0.1% net bad loan ratio. We have a very good default rate. We are almost at half of November, so halfway to the year-end. I expect, apart from some managerial action that we could take by the year-end, something in line with the previous cost of risk.

The next question is from Matteo Banchetti, Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
Matteo Panchetti
Equity Research Analyst
1:08:33
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have one clarification on RWAs and capital for the quarter. Can you please clarify? Because when I see on your booking loans, they are down 2% quarter on quarter, but your RWA were up quarter on quarter. Can you please clarify if there were any headwinds during this quarter or if the density has been increasing? The second one is on the overlays.
Matteo Panchetti
Equity Research Analyst
1:09:04
You still have 150 million overlays. At which point will you consider to release or eventually using that? Thank you.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:09:14
No, we have grouped the 13 basis points. In page 23, RWA and other. Actually, this includes a number of second-order effects that give a contribution. The specific part of what the RWA is only 6 basis points, and it's related in general to normal refresh of the portfolio, but nothing that creates any real drift towards a higher level of density or headwinds in this quarter. The rest is due to a number of minor impacts. For example, increase in the value of our participations that we deduct from capital, and that if they use equity method for our valuation, if they mature net profit over the quarter, then this net profit is accounted for in the value of the participation, and this value is.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:10:34
An increase in the capital deduction. Not material effect on credit in general. Yeah. Overlays. Usual debate. Overlays, technically speaking, are not something like a treasure we have and at some point will be left for release. Overlays are a way to account for unexpected, novel risks that are not modeled and that you capture in your framework of risk management framework and IFRS 9 accounting framework through adjustments on top of what the risk model suggests to have in terms of generic provisions on performing loans. The only thing that counts is the level of coverage on performing stage one and stage two, and this coverage is driven by considerations on the status of the portfolio. We are sticking to a coverage which is in the area of above 40 basis points. We have increased from 45 to 46 basis points in this quarter.
Giuseppe Castagna
CEO
1:12:01
We believe that this is our sweet spot in the long run. We believe that any comparison should take into account between banks on this KPI, and should take into account, of course, geographic footprint, average rating of portfolios, and so on and so forth.

Good morning, and thank you for joining our Q3 results presentation. Before getting into our Q3 results, I would like to mention that last week, we submitted, together with Bouygues Telecom and Free (Iliad Group), a joint non-binding offer to acquire a large part of Altice France activities in France. In a challenging competitive environment, this deal would allow us to strengthen investments in France while maintaining a competitive ecosystem for the benefit of consumers. This non-binding offer amounts to €17 billion, of which 27% for Orange. There is no certainty that we will reach an agreement, and we are willing to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Altice France group. Back to our Q3 results, we remain fully focused on our business execution, and we are really pleased to report strong results driven by a robust commercial performance in France, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa region.

In France in particular, we are proud to reaffirm our leadership in fiber, with over 10 million customers and plus 1.1 million new customers in the last 12 months. We have become the first operator in Europe to surpass this milestone in the domestic market, marking a major achievement in our state-of-the-art network commercialization. In Spain, Orange and MASMOVIL have announced an agreement with Vodafone Spain and GIC to create the largest fiber company named Premium Fiber. With 12 million premises and 5 million customers, this fiber core will provide considerable benefits for the Spanish market. Our continued focus on cost efficiency is reflected in the EBITDA growth of 3.7% this quarter, along with a 0.7% point improvement in margin rate. These robust results enable us to once again upgrade our full-year guidance, with a full-year EBITDA now expected to grow by at least 3.5%.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:02:41
Let's review our strong Q3 results on slide five. Revenues increased by 0.8% in the third quarter, driven by robust retail performance of 2.6%, which offsets the expected decline in wholesale. From a segment perspective, revenue growth is led by Middle East and Africa, achieving double-digit growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, and Europe back to growth thanks to retail services and IT and IS. In France, retail excluding PSTN grew 0.2% as expected and was offset by the anticipated decline in wholesale and equipment sales. EBITDA reached €3.4 billion, growing by 3.7%, giving us confidence to upgrade our full-year guidance to at least 3.5%. This growth is driven by our solid performance, as well as our continuous efficiency initiatives fueled by advancements in procurement, AI, and operational efficiency ambitions. In line with our eCapEx discipline, we maintain a CapEx to sales ratio of approximately 15%.
Christel Heydemann

I will now hand over to Laurent for the business review, starting with France on slide seven.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:03:59
Thank you, Christel. Good morning, everyone. In France, in a market which is overall flattish in value, the competitive environment remains generally stable, with sustained competition on the low end. In this context, we continue to uphold our efficient commercial strategy, grounded in extensive and innovative segmentation, strong customer loyalty, and value. This strategy led to a robust commercial performance, with 138,000 mobile net ads per quarter since the fourth quarter of 2022, 274,000 on fiber, and 20,000 on convergence. This performance is driven by increased momentum on Orange brand and effective churn management, with mobile churn improving by more than two points year on year. Convergence ARPO continued to grow, increasing by 1.1% year on year in the third quarter, while mobile and fixed broadband ARPO slightly declined year on year, reflecting the mixed effect related to the competitive landscape over the past year.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:05:08
Fixed broadband ARPO slightly improved on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Moving to the financials, for France, our disciplined and efficient commercial strategy led to 0.2% growth in retail ex-PSTN revenues as expected. Revenue continues to be impacted by the structural anticipated decline in wholesale. Globally, we remain committed to cost optimization and confirm our objective of growing EBITDA in France in 2025, slightly more than in 2024. Let's turn to Middle East and Africa, which continue to deliver a very strong performance, demonstrating once again our positive momentum. Revenues are up double-digit for the 10th consecutive quarter, driven by our four key drivers. Looking forward, on the back of this performance, we are fully confident in our ability to achieve double-digit EBITDA growth in 2025. Let's turn to Europe.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:06:15
Revenues are back to growth in Europe this quarter at 4.7%, driven by services growing at 1.4%, thanks to a balanced volume value strategy and an exceptional IT and IS quarter, notably in Poland. Net ads remain very robust in both mobile and fixed broadband, with mobile customer base reaching 22 million. Convergence revenue showed once again a strong performance, increasing by close to 6%. Looking ahead, we do confirm as well our 2025 outlook with a low single-digit EBITDA growth. Moving to Orange Business Services, revenues are impacted by last year's portfolio pruning, by the difficult IT market, and by the French macro environment. In that context, Orange's cyber defense growth remains solid at over 6% in the first nine months. In parallel, we are accelerating our transformation initiatives, focusing on growth areas such as sovereignty and security, while stepping up our efforts to optimize our cost base.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:07:27
Nevertheless, considering the complex condition of the global IT market and the French market macro environment, the ambition to have EBITDA decrease in 2025 versus 2024 is difficult. Let's complete with MASMOVIL Orange, our joint venture, which continues to create value with a strong focus on delivering synergies, which are close to our €300 million target by year end. In this competitive market, we achieved strong net ads in the mobile segment and maintained stable volumes in fixed. Revenues are up 1.7% this quarter. Services revenues benefit from strong growth in both B2B and our new business initiatives, which offset the negative mix effect in a challenging telco market. We have been as well able to close strategic alliances with tier-one partners in energy, insurance, and alarms.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:08:29
The positive momentum on equipment sales also fueled growth in the third quarter and is helping to extend the lifetime value of our customers. Lastly, we do confirm our outlook for 2025 for MASMOVIL Orange. Back to you, Christel, for the conclusion.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:08:48
Thank you, Laurent. I would like to conclude this presentation by confirming that our robust Q3 and nine month results make us very confident in reaching our objectives. In addition, reflecting our continued focus on efficiency and operational excellence, we are upgrading our EBITDA guidance to at least 3.5% after a previous upgrade in H1. Thank you for your attention. The floor is now open for questions.

Akhil Dattani
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:09:55
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got two, please, if I can. The first is on French consolidation. Christel, you mentioned the non-binding offer that you as a consortium have now submitted to SFR. I guess the details are limited, but the one thing that stood out was that the % of the total transaction price that Orange will pay is 27%, which seemed higher than people might have assumed, given expectations that there are relatively small portions of SFR that you'd likely buy. Could you just start by helping us maybe understand at a high level how that price was determined and maybe any color you can give us on how we should understand what bits of SFR you could buy? You mentioned within that in your commentary that you are willing to engage with Drahi and the creditors.
Akhil Dattani
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:10:48
I just wondered if any sort of engagement has now kicked off so far. That's the first question. The second one, I guess, sticking with the event-driven aspect of these things, is MASMOVIL Orange. In the last few weeks, there's been a lot of speculation around your engagement with your private equity partners around a potential buyout of the 50% of the asset you don't own. Any sort of update on what is actually going on and what you can share? I guess more broadly, is there any sort of timeline we should think about by which when you would need to make this call and then alternatively move to an IPO process? Is there any sort of timeframe we can understand? Thanks a lot.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:11:33
Thanks, Akhil. On the French consolidation and the non-binding offer, I won't provide you more details on the split than what has been already communicated. As we've said, the B2B business would mainly be towards Bouygues Telecom and Iliad. We're looking at B2C spectrum and assets. We've done the estimates based on the level of synergies we would generate and based on what we could purchase. It's really a value-driven split. It's too early to provide you more comment given it's still a non-binding offer and we haven't reached an agreement with the seller, as you know. On the engagement so far, I won't comment. As you know, we made public the fact that we had submitted a non-binding offer given the importance of this transaction for the French market and for us, Orange, a listed company, and for Bouygues as well.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:12:48
Our main priority, we know we would like to move as fast as possible in a process for the seller to decide. They have different options. We don't expect to make public every single discussion we would have if we want to move fast. We know there's a lot of media attention. I mean, 50% shareholder in MASMOVIL Orange, we are planning and we are working on the strat plan, the financial plan for MASMOVIL Orange. As part of this discussion, we are fully in line with what's provided in the shareholder agreement. There's a lock-in period before an IPO can be triggered in April 2026. We are also investigating all other options. As we said, they always remain open. There's no specific timeline and there's for sure no rush for us to reach an agreement.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:14:07
Clearly, the discussions we have on the financial forecast for the company and the ambitions we both have for the company is probably what's generating a lot of media and speculation, I would say.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:14:22
I think just to add on the French side that, of course, the price that we would put is consistent with the asset and the value we would purchase, obviously.
Akhil Dattani
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research

Great, thanks.
Operator
0:14:37
Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please unmute yourself and ask your question.
Andrew Lee
MD
0:14:47
Yeah, good morning, everyone. I had two questions. One was just to see if we can push a little further on, as Akhil put it, the event-driven opportunities for Orange. There's not much you can say on French consolidation. Could you just talk? You said obviously you want to accelerate or you want to move fast on French consolidation. Could you talk about your confidence in the approval process around consolidation more broadly in France in terms of both the EU competition authority approval and French authority approval and what's given you the confidence to launch this bid? If there are any timing implications around moving fast there. As a follow-up to that, just on the MASMOVIL Orange side of things, is the speculation around Spanish consolidation complicating the timeline to kind of you reaching a conclusion on what you plan to do with that asset? A separate operational question.
Andrew Lee
MD
0:16:02
In France, it looks a little bit like the competitive intensity at low-end mobile has spilled a bit into low-end fixed. Is that true? If you could just articulate what's going on there, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:16:20
Thanks, Andrew. On the French consolidation, first of all, as you know, there's a process where Altice France has been restructured and the owner actually wants to sell. That's the driver of all those discussions, number one. Of course, in that environment, we do believe that a French group of companies providing synergies is the best solution to create maximum value. Now, when it comes to the regulatory process, the political environment, it's really too early and we know that authorities will have to review that in detail. In any case, if you look at the option, which is a piecemeal deal on one side or a solution amongst other telcos, we do believe that not only our proposal is the best one to protect the intensity of competition, but also to protect the ability of the industry to invest.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:17:26
We know our networks require investment for security, for AI, and for resilience. We know the antitrust authorities are what they are. We know what happened in the UK with the CMA approval. We don't have any signal from antitrust authorities that they would approve such a transaction. We know, based on our experience with both Belgium and Spain, that they would review carefully. It could be EU or French processes. Actually, given we have three companies bidding for the main part of Altice France, it would probably be three antitrust processes. Depending on any of us, the three, it can be France or Brussels. Of course, antitrust authorities can decide to take the whole approach. There's no doubt that both authorities would work together, I would say, on the assessment.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:18:28
The main rationale for us on why this deal makes sense, first of all, it's something we've been pushing and we are absolutely convinced that Europe needs consolidation, national consolidation. When you look at the intensity of the competition on our mobile markets, the ability to create synergy and efficiency for us on mobile is also the ability to sustainably compete and offer low prices to consumers. That's really the driver and that's going to be the core of our explanation, I would say, with antitrust authorities. Not to forget that this is a French group of companies in an environment where we're talking about highly critical assets. Again, there's no certainty that this deal would be approved until it is. On MASMOVIL Orange, no, all the rumors and speculation on MASMOVIL Orange or all the speculation on what could happen in the Spanish market have no impact.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:19:33
I mean, we looked at the valuation of MASMOVIL Orange in a standalone, I would say, view. Of course, we work actively to improve, I would say, our position in the Spanish market. That's the reason why we signed and we launched Premium Fiber, because we know there's a lot of players. I do believe that consolidation in Spain will probably come first from smaller players. We know some of them. Some of them are actually partners of us. Clearly, the market in Spain remains super competitive and will remain super competitive for quite some time. The comment I was making on antitrust authorities for France would be exactly the same for Spain. We would not expect anything to happen soon or to be concluded to reach closing for MASMOVIL Orange. We don't take that into account, of course, for us.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:20:35
When it comes to the competitive intensity in France, the low-end market remains very competitive. It's true that in Q3, we've seen a number of entry price points increasing. We are more around the €10 for mobile. There's still Red, which is the SFR brand, cheaper than that. We've seen a €1, €2, €3 difference compared to what we had seen, especially in the end of Q1 and Q2. On broadband, there's also promotions for the low-end broadband, but the market remains stable compared to what it was before. Last but not least, you know how important our convergence strategy is. That's really for us the fuel and the growth engine in our retail market in France.
Andrew Lee
MD
0:21:36
Thank you, Christel. Very helpful.

Next up, we'll hear from Josh Mills, BNP Paribas. Josh, please unmute yourself and ask your questions.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research
0:21:51
Hi, guys. Two questions from my side, please. The first was just around Orange's group leverage. Would you be able to give us a bit of color about how you expect the SFR deal, if it goes through, to impact your leverage profile? Following on from that, does the leverage post the SFR deal still leave you with enough headroom to pursue other transactions, such as buying in MASMOVIL Orange, as an example? Somewhat related to that, given that the French consolidation deal, if approved, won't complete until the second half of 2027, how do we think about how this impacts your shareholder returns policy to be outlined at the Capital Markets Day in February? The second question for me is just going back to the operational performance in France.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research
0:22:35
I think last quarter you gave a bit more color on your expectations for how French service revenues ex-PSTN should develop. Obviously, it slowed down 20 bps versus last quarter. How should we think about this going into year end? Is there the chance that this is going to turn negative or do you still have the ambition of maintaining flat to slightly positive retail revenues ex-PSTN in Q4? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:23:02
Thank you, Josh. I'll start by your second question and then Laurent can comment on your first one. Operational performance and for Q4, we expect the same trend as Q3, which means flat to small positive growth, excluding PSTN for retail services. Really, same trend as Q3. On the group leverage, Laurent can comment. I think we've said before, it's very important for us. We know shareholder return is important and we have a leverage that allows us to be flexible. Of course, remaining investment grade is important. We think we have a solid balance sheet and we have the opportunity to carry several transactions.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:23:54
Yes, good morning, Georgios. Indeed, as you know, we have a very strong balance sheet. Of course, the potential acquisition of SFR will have some impact on the leverage, but it will create as well a lot of value, as we said, which means that this leverage will basically be smoothed on a relatively short period of time. Overall, we are confident that we can run both the MASMOVIL-Orange potential acquisition and our fair share of SFR purchase without, I would say, impacting the shareholder return, which remains for us a top priority.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research
0:24:38
Thanks. Maybe just one other follow-up, if I may. If we were to see the bid price for SFR change or increase over the coming months, is the agreement for the asset split between Iliad, Bouygues, and yourselves and the percentages given set in stone? Would there be the potential for certain operators to change the amount which they're buying and the assets which they are acquiring as part of the deal? How much flexibility is there on the 27% split you have today?
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:25:06
Thanks, Josh. You can be assured that the three of us have a very constructive dialogue and that's what we want to have with the seller. Obviously, I don't want to give you information that would jeopardize our ability to have the best negotiation in a transaction that's obviously very complex. As we said, we are value-driven in our approach. Each company, let's not forget that we have a very strict antitrust process and that this bid has been prepared, of course, with all the scrutiny and to be compliant with competition rules. All of us have our own models of valuation, but we also have such an experience and we know, of course, very well the French market. That's something we would be able to discuss, the three of us, with the seller.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:26:04
Again, a value-driven approach, which doesn't mean we're thinking of a mechanical negotiation for such a transaction with such impact on every three players.
Joshua Mills
Executive Director Sector Head, Telecoms Research

Many thanks.

Thank you. Our next question today comes from Roshan Ranjit from Deutsche Bank. Roshan, you can unmute yourself and ask your questions.
Roshan Ranjit
TMT Equity Research Analyst
0:26:28
Great. Morning, everyone. I've got two questions, please. First question, just I guess in the context of any potential antitrust audience that we do get, can you remind us what % of your B2B revenues and total revenues you derive from France, please? The second question on the operational side. This was the second quarter where you have upgraded your EBITDA guidance, yet we haven't seen anything change on the organic cash flow level. Appreciate it is a greater than metric, but are there any other moving parts at the organic cash flow level? I know last year you absorbed a higher cash tax, yet still saw an upgrade, but any details you could give there would be very helpful. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:27:24
Thanks, Roshan. As you know, we do not publish the splits of our B2B between in France, but clearly, we have taken into account in our negotiation with Iliad Free and Bouygues Telecom the fact that when we have high market share, you can count on our competitors to try to get assets that would help them grow and increase market share. That's why the B2B part of Altice France would go to Bouygues Telecom and to some extent Iliad Free, not to us. We don't publish the split on B2B in France. On organic cash flow guidance, Laurent?
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:28:16
Yes. Hi, Roshan. Our guidance on cash remains valid above €3.6 billion of OCF. That remains valid. I just take the opportunity to state that within our 3.8% of EBITDA growth in France, we have 0.9 points coming from the bank, which are not part of our OCF, as you know.

Mathieu Robilliard

Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:29:14
Yes, we can.
Mathieu Robilliard
Director
0:29:16
Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I had two questions. The first one was around Orange Business Services. You mentioned that the environment was tough and you have slightly, or you will maybe change the guidance or at least what you deliver. The question was a bit broader. Clearly, it is natural to see you lose a bit of market share on communication. I also understand that on IT, it's a competitive market. At the same time, we see a lot of growth for some services like cybersecurity, data centers, cloud, and obviously talks of increased need for sovereignty in Europe should be a positive for you. Maybe you could lay out a little bit where you see growth coming from at some point in the next future.
Mathieu Robilliard
Director
0:30:02
Also, if you could give a bit of clarity in terms of your data center exposure, maybe if you could give us a sense of what is the capacity you have in France and in Europe and how you expect that to grow. The second question, I was going to ask again about the potential SFR transaction. Just a point of clarification, because in the press release, you indicate that not all of the assets of Altice France SFR are concerned by the bid. I also note that in the French press, there was some reference that the offer that you were making for the assets represented an EBITDA multiple of around 6.6, which kind of suggests, if I'm getting my math right, that the value of the EBITDA that you are bidding for is around €2.6 billion.
Mathieu Robilliard
Director
0:30:53
Quite lower than what the trajectory of Altice France EBITDA suggests for the full year based on the H1. I don't know if you can give a bit of detail as to what you're buying. I understand, obviously, there's no French overseas. There's some service businesses of Altice France that are not included. If you could give a sense of what is the EBITDA as a whole you would be buying, that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:31:22
Thank you, Matthew. On the Orange business, clearly, there's, of course, the structural transition from legacy connectivity to next-generation connectivity. That's changing the nature of the services we provide, moving from a traditional telco to a more integration type of services. We are investing in our evolution platform, in really having a platforming approach for those services. Of course, cybersecurity is clearly, and by the way, next-generation connectivity is not a market that's declining. Of course, compared to the value of legacy, there's a value difference. Clearly, the next-generation connectivity is not a decreasing market. Cybersecurity, clearly, it's. Also, on cloud and data center, on cloud to start with, we are transitioning from some, so part of our solution has been in the pruning of the portfolio. We have some transition effect.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:32:32
That's clearly an area where we are investing on sovereign cloud, private sovereign cloud, public sovereign cloud with Blue together with Capgemini. When it comes to data center capacity, we don't provide details. We have capacity in all the countries where we operate, and we are investigating plans to accelerate in that field. We are not a pure player in data centers, so we are still thinking what should be our strategy. Not ready to provide you more details on this. On SFR, clearly, the list of assets is what has been published. It's very clear. It's everything in Altice France but the overseas business, XP Fiber, Intelsia, UltraEdge, and ATS, their field services unit. That's everything else.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:33:28
When it comes to EBITDA, bear in mind that for us, the valuation is both, of course, a multiple of EBITDA, which so far was based on the data we have, which is end of 2024, as well as our own assessment of synergies. Every of the three bidders has done its own assessed synergy plan. We've done our math, and clearly, the value comes from the synergies as well. It's not an easy, straightforward EBITDA calculation.

MD and Senior Equity Analyst
0:34:28
All right, great. If you could ask a couple on consolidation as well, please. On the argument, Christel, you mentioned the pro-consolidation argument it seems you're going to use is to protect competition. Could you just explain to us why you think cutting out a disruptive operator protects competition here? Are you arguing that Altice France wasn't sustainable? Maybe you could help us with that. Secondly, it's going to be up to the three of you to put together remedies. On the structural side, do you think there are any acceptable remedy takers left or do you believe the remedies, are you thinking this is going to be behavioral now post the CMA decision, for example? Could you help us a little bit with what sort of remedies might we have to think about? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:35:12
Thank you, Nicolas. I won't say anything that would prevent our ability to run a smooth and open dialogue with antitrust authorities. Clearly, what we see and think of mobile consolidation, and we know that from our MASMOVIL Orange experience, where 18 months after closing, we are driving synergies that allow us to continue to compete on the low end as well as to compete on our A brand on the premium market. We are driving synergies and the market and the price point for consumers has not changed, on the contrary. In France, I think what we know is that we know exactly the amount of synergies that can be driven by bringing more mobile customers or broadband customers on our infrastructure. That's driving efficiency that in return allows us to continue to compete and to offer attractive price points for consumers while continuing to invest.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:36:18
Otherwise, you have to cut investments if you want to just continue to play in a super competitive market. Remember that we would then end up with three players in the market, two of them being stronger. Of course, our objective is to be the leader in France. Our two other competitors post-consolidation, if that goes through, would have more ability to invest and would have more ability to compete head-to-head with us. That is why we do believe that competition authorities should really look at it similar to what the CMA has done in the UK.

Okay, now we hear you. Sorry about that. Good morning. Two questions, yes, if I can. The first one is, can you update us a little bit on the cost savings? I'm partially thinking of the early retirement plan, where you are in this regard, and perhaps also the network shutdown. I think you were planning to launch a tender for the copper and have different contractors. I was just wondering where you stand on that as you continue to make progress in your cost cutting plan. The second question, coming back to the offer, I was just trying to clarify one thing. If you're contributing 27% to the bid, would it be fair to say that your share of the EBITDA of SFR is probably a little bit lower than that because you may be taking a bit more spectrum than some other buyers in the consortium?
Stephane Beyazian
Equity Research
0:38:29
Would that be fair? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:38:33
Thank you, Stéphane. I'll start with your second question. I won't provide you more details. Unfortunately, we don't want to speculate on what could be. Remember, this is only a non-binding offer at this stage and we haven't agreed with the sellers. I think it's really premature to provide you more details on that. The split of assets is exactly the one that has been shared in the press release. On cost savings, the early retirement plan is now open. It's been open for several months. The employees who are deciding on a voluntary basis to accept it, many have volunteered already. It's really executing as per plan. I don't know if Laurent, you want to comment on the various cost savings, procurement, and the copper RFP as well.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:39:33
Good morning, Stephane. We continue to move full steam on the cost optimization, and you refer to procurement. We are working on our €18 billion cost base to drive savings on this part. The copper contract is one of the major contracts on which we are working with Jérôme and the team in France, which is not yet decided. That will come for the next month. It is a jumbo contract indeed for the next four or five years. We will be, of course, eager to get the best value out of this contract to drive the strategic project for Orange France.

Ottavio Adorisio
Equity Analyst

Perfect. I have a few questions there for that, but let's first start from Spain. You basically recently monetized or announced the monetization of the fiber core, the JV between Orange and Zegona. Now, Zegona, the main asset they brought were the clients. Therefore, the monetization of the assets relied on the long-term commitment of Zegona clients to that network. Zegona has the habit of playing many different fields. It looks to be likely that the potential could be a target for Telefónica. I was wondering how difficult it will be for Zegona to move to migrate these clients, if there are any penalty fees in that particular deal, and can Zegona actually disentangle from that JV? The second point is on the credit ratings. You effectively reiterate that it doesn't really matter the two deals you're currently negotiating in Spain and in France. You still remain investment grade.
Ottavio Adorisio

That's true because basically you have quite large room. It's likely that potentially the BBB+ could be downgraded by one notch. Are you prepared for that or do you reckon that you have other levers to avoid that particular downgrade by one notch by the agencies? The third point is on the pricing. Pricing is domestic. You made a lot of comments on the fact that there is a lot of competition on the low segments, the value segments. I noticed that this quarter has been a bit different. It's not only been mobile where you've still got an ARPU that's going down around 4%. For the first time, I don't remember for how many quarters, you actually have a negative trend on the fixed ARPU.
Ottavio Adorisio
Equity Analyst
0:42:29
If you can comment on that one, do we expect the repricing on fixed to continue and to have a negative trend in the next few quarters? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:42:41
Thank you, Otavio. On Spain, with the implication of Zegona and Premium Fiber, be assured that, of course, we have long-term commitment from both, of course, MASMOVIL, Orange, and a third-party investor like GIC in such a transaction. That's really something that has been carefully taken care of. Laurent, the investment grade?
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:43:24
Hi, Otavio. On the rating, of course, early days, because we have as a... That is pure speculation, of course. Globally, we have a strong triple B plus rating. We feel that we have capacity to stick to this rating despite all of these potential transactions. It will all depend on the timing and the sequence of it. Globally, we are very confident that midterm will remain on this triple B plus rating that we enjoy today.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:44:05
On price competition in France, you're right that our ARPU for broadband is slightly declining compared to one year ago, but it's also slightly increasing compared to Q2. That's what we can say. I don't know if maybe Jérôme, you want to give more details on the pricing environment and what we've seen.
Jérôme Henique
EVP and CEO
0:44:30
Thank you, Christel. As you said, the environment remains quite stable on broadband, while it's more competitive on mobile low end in particular. What is very important for us is the convergent ARPU. As you reminded, convergence is our growth engine and our convergent ARPU is increasing by 1.8% at €78.6. On broadband, we don't see so much intensity on the competition, but it's true that some mid-range offers on the market and some promotions have been impacting the year-over-year ARPU, but still progressing on a quarter-over-quarter basis, as you said.

Thanks. Next up is David Wright from Bank of America. David, please unmute yourself and ask your questions. Go ahead.
David Wright
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:45:37
Hopefully, you guys can hear me. Thank you so much. Two questions, please. I think on both the Bouygues call and your comments earlier, you suggested the regulation could be separate processes, possibly even... I'm talking about, of course, the SFR deal, possibly even separate jurisdictions. I assume these are not mutually exclusive. If any one of those regulation approaches were to find difficulties or unreasonable remedies, I assume the entire deal would be off. Could there be any possibility, for instance, for Bouygues to separately buy the B2B business of SFR? I'm assuming any problem with any regulation on the whole deal is challenged. If you could confirm that. I am a little confused just on the French broadband pricing. I think you said... you said that the ARPU is obviously down a little more now. What is happening? Are you losing higher-value customers and adding lower-value customers?
David Wright
Head of European Telecoms Equity Research
0:46:52
Are the higher-value customers migrating into convergence? I'm just trying to understand that mix effect. Those two questions, thank you very much.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:47:02
Thank you, David. On regulation, clearly, it's one proposal with three bidders, and our proposal cannot be split apart. Otherwise, it's not the same. Now, the regulation and the antitrust authorities would review case by case because they would review the impact for every one of the three companies separately. Of course, it's in a global approach to the market of what the Altice France sale would impact. Clearly, even though it could be reviewed by a different size or one per company, in the end, it's the assessment of one transaction and the impact for each company in the market. It's too early to say whether one authority would claim the leadership on the other one. What we know is that in any case for any transaction, when we were reviewing with Brussels the Spanish transaction, the Spanish authorities were reviewing carefully and remained involved by Brussels.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:48:12
In any case, we know that both teams would review carefully this transaction. On the French broadband pricing, clearly, as you know, we are gaining customers on broadband. We have indeed some of the new customers, that's why we call it the mix impact, have an entry price that's lower than the average ARPU that we had in our base. That's why you see a small impact on the base. You see the ARPU compared to Q2 and it's slightly increasing. We've had that impact in the past, so it's not really significant. We don't see a spin down of customers moving from high offers or premium offers to lower offers. Of course, we have some migration from pure broadband to convergent customers, and you see overall every segment of our customers is positive in net adds.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:49:17
All in all, we are adding more customers in our base, and the mix, that's what we call the mix effect, some of these new customers are coming with a lower price than the base. That's the impact on the average ARPU.

Okay, we are going to come back to you, Carl, for the time being. We are going to take our next question, which comes from Ondrej Cabejšek from UBS. Ondrej, please unmute yourself and ask your question.
Ondrej Cabejsek
Equity Research Analyst
0:50:17
Hi everyone, good morning. Thanks for allowing me to take questions. I've got one follow-up and then a separate question on Spain. The first follow-up is basically on the shareholder returns policy, which obviously you said is a very important feature for the company. Over the past three years, we've had a feature within this, which was that every year the dividend was supposed to grow. I was curious, now that we only have a floor, you have more clarity into I guess the timing of potential deals and the potential amounts involved and therefore the impacts on your balance sheet. I was also curious to therefore see whether the kind of growth element of the shareholder returns policy is something that you will be thinking about as very important for the next three-year period. That's one question.
Ondrej Cabejsek
Equity Research Analyst
0:51:06
The second question on Spain, coming from a slightly different angle, you have been in discussions with Vodafone also around potential RAN sharing, which obviously would have a benefit to your CapEx and also potentially to Totem, I believe. I was just curious whether there is any update on those specific negotiations. Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:51:31
On the shareholder return policy, I won't provide you more details. Of course, we know that's one item that we would cover as part of our 2025 results in February and our Capital Markets Day at the same time. Yes, you're right. We have a floor at $0.75, as reminded in our guidance. On Spain, we already have RAN sharing in some areas of Spain between Orange and Vodafone Spain. Nothing new on that front to comment on. Of course, when it comes to tower companies and Totem, actually, we have been negotiating, but that was part of our synergy plan. When we combine Orange and MASMOVIL, we have been renegotiating and working on the network synergies between the two companies. Also, as part of that, all tower companies in Spain have been contributing. Of course, Totem was already supplying Orange and the network of Orange has been maintained.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:52:47
Not much to comment on top of that. No, nothing new on the network synergies, I would say, beyond what we had already planned as part of the Orange and MASMOVIL transaction.
Ondrej Cabejsek
Equity Research Analyst
0:52:59
No progress on like the full RAN sharing project that's been kind of in the media in Spain?
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:53:06
I guess you're talking about some speculation around the creation of a specific vehicle where we would combine assets. Indeed, nothing. We have, as we are, which is we are sharing and we are using the Vodafone Spain network and they are using the MASMOVIL Orange network in some areas. Nothing has changed.
Ondrej Cabejsek

Emmett Kelly
Senior Research Analyst European and Global Telecoms
0:54:09
Okay, good morning, Christel. Good morning, Laurent. I've got two questions, please. The first question, please, is on consolidation and it's on the potential impact on towers. Can you say if there would be any impact on Totem Towers in France from a successful completion of the transaction? Secondly, just looking at the press release last week, you said that the non-binding offer is subject to several factors and one of these is the due diligence. As you get access to the SFR data room, what are you really looking for? Are you looking at the churn of the subscribers, the quality of the subscribers, the free cash flow profile of the business? Are you looking for areas of overlap where you can target cost reductions? What are your red lines there? Thank you very much.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:55:08
Thanks, Emmett, on the impact of any potential consolidation on the French market and specifically on Totem. Of course, given our view is that we would create more synergies, we would actually load our network with more customers. No impact foreseen. Every day our teams are planning for network evolution. As you know, part of the transaction is to solidify the ability for telecom operators in France to continue to invest. I think this transaction, on the contrary, would probably provide more ability in the long run for all players in the market to invest, which I see as positive for Totem. On the due diligence, nothing specific. This is really pretty standard what we look at for due diligence. It goes from the financials, but also everything that you can think of, but really standard. No specific, no red lines. It's really pretty standard.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Fernando Cordero from Santander. Fernando, please unmute yourself and ask your questions.
Fernando Cordero
Equity Research Analyst, Executive Director
0:56:35
Okay, thank you very much. Two questions from my side. The first one in Spain, and particularly also on the potential consolidation scenarios. I would like to understand at which extent you would be interested in or you believe that MASMOVIL Orange would be, let's say, stronger if it would be regaining the full control on the mobile network. Today, it is having a RAN sharing agreement with Vodafone Spain. I would like to understand in which scenarios you would be interested in having full control of this RAN sharing agreement. The second question, also starting from Spain but ending in France, given that the operations in Spain are now putting a lot of focus on, let's say, services on top of connectivity, starting with devices, but also other services like energy, alarms, and so on.
Fernando Cordero
Equity Research Analyst, Executive Director
0:57:22
At which extent do you foresee this strategy to be potentially implemented as well in France? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:57:35
Thank you, Fernando. In Spain, on the network side and potential further market consolidation, we don't see, I mean, we cannot comment. As you see, we've created the Premium Fiber because we see the value of combining assets and making sure we bring more customers on an existing infrastructure. We have this similar rationale, very value-driven approach. When it comes to mobile network, we don't, I mean, as we said, nothing has changed. We leverage the Vodafone Spain network. They leverage our network. We are more looking for more synergies than trying to de-synergize amongst players, given the competitive intensity in the market. When it comes to diversification, a lot of the initiatives that MASMOVIL Orange has launched are actually already in place in France. We have been home security is a market we have launched a few years ago, insurance as well, content as well.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
0:58:48
Devices, I mean, equipment sales are actually part of the growth in MASMOVIL Orange. It is somehow applying the same rules that Orange Spain or the same recipe that Orange Spain was having from a marketing standpoint to the full MASMOVIL Orange scope. I think, of course, we keep on learning from things that MASMOVIL Orange is launching and testing in Spain. That's useful to compare and to benchmark ourselves also in France. This is something we have done already as well in France for quite some time.
Laurent Martinez
CFO
0:59:22
Fernando, we can add that around 8% of our retail services are coming from all of these adjacents. There is a clear path in terms of positive evolution on this. Indeed, we are cross-fertilizing with our Orange colleagues on these subjects.
Fernando Cordero
Equity Research Analyst, Executive Director

Eric Ravary
Analyste Financier
1:00:00
Hello. Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First one on Orange Business Services. In the press release, you don't reiterate your target to stabilize the EBITDA in 2026. I wanted to check if you're removing the guidance for next year. The second question is on wholesale revenues in France. The decline is accelerating over the last two quarters at minus 9%. For the next quarters, should we expect the wholesale to come to a double-digit decline due to the acceleration of copper decommissioning? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:00:42
Thank you. On the Orange Business soft guidance, what we see clearly is that the overall market environment, be it the IT market or the French, I would say, macro environment, is highly uncertain. In that environment, our message is that it's difficult. The guidance we have is difficult, but we are not setting a different guidance at this stage. Of course, our strategic plan for Orange Business and our cybersecurity activity would be a core pillar of our next Capital Markets Day in February. We continue to drive with the same intensity our efficiency program, our transformation, our repositioning on the new portfolio. It's really more the overall market environment that's making the execution of the plan uncertain and difficult. It's not because we are slowing down on everything we've launched already. On the wholesale trajectory for Q4, Laurent, I suppose it's the same, but...
Laurent Martinez
CFO
1:01:51
Indeed, what we said, Eric, is that the second half wholesale evolution will be in line with the H1, same trend. All of that is definitely in line with our global guidance. You know, you remind of €1 billion revenue decline of wholesale between 2022 to 2025, so fully consistent with our expected trajectory.

Thank you. As a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, please raise your hand in Teams, or if you're connected on your mobile phone, to raise your hand, it is star five. Now, we will move on to our last question from Russell Waller from New Street Research. Russell, please unmute yourself and ask your question.
Russell Waller
Equity Analyst
1:02:43
Thank you. Excuse me. Yes, good morning, everyone. I just had some questions on the offer to SFR, please. First of all, could you just explain why your offer excludes those assets that you listed? XP Fiber, Intelsia, etc. Why were they excluded? Would you consider changing your offer to bid for the equity so it includes those assets, for example, if that's what the seller wanted? Second question, obviously the offer was made in public. Can you just confirm that that's standard practice? For example, when you made the offer to MASMOVIL, were there negotiations in private first and then the offer was made in public, or did you just make the offer in public, as you did for SFR?
Russell Waller
Equity Analyst
1:03:30
Finally, could you just talk about whether or not there might be clawbacks or clauses included in the deal based on, say, the performance of the underlying asset at SFR? There are some people who have concerns that there's underinvestment or CapEx is low, for example, and you might buy an asset that maybe doesn't quite meet expectations. How would you protect yourself from that aspect? Thank you.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:03:55
Thank you. On the overall transaction, and of course, I mean, the fact that we have a proposal coming from three players is not standard practice in submitting an NBO. Especially with two players listed and given the amount we're talking about, and the fact that we had officially submitted an offer, we thought, and that was also a legal interpretation. That's something we've disclosed and we've discussed with the market authorities. That's not something we decided on our own. That's really what has driven the press release on the proposal, even though indeed it's an NBO. At this stage, it's not the confirmation that we've reached an agreement with the seller. That's very clear. It's very early to comment on other things like a clawback clause or everything, because that would mean we have a final and signed agreement. Of course, that's something we would be happy to comment on.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:05:11
We hope on the day when we have a deal agreed between parties. That's not the case today. On the assets and some of the assets that have been excluded, XP Fiber, as you know, is owned 50% by Altice only, or 49% or 51%, I don't remember. Other players are involved and it's an asset that has been for sale for some time. Some of the other assets are really independent assets and very different from our telco business when it comes to call centers for supporting Altice. We don't think these are assets that naturally make sense for us to acquire. We don't think, by the way, that Altice would have difficulty to find to launch a sale process. Again, what we said is we believe our proposal is a good proposal. We want to be constructive and dialogue.
Christel Heydemann
CEO
1:06:09
I don't want to anticipate any conclusion that would be reached. I don't want to put words in the mouth of Altice. That's for them to assess what they want to do.
Russell Waller
