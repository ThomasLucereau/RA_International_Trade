Director, Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q1 fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of investor relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh.
After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.
Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.

Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness+, Beats, and more, L.A.
is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts, and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now, turning to the quarter.
Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year over year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others.
In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record. And in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our install base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S.
English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now, users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use Writing Tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with Clean Up. We introduce visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings.
Users can also seamlessly access ChatGPT across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India.
And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like private cloud compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud.
Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions.
Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced, it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year over year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup.
The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launch pad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips, to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super-portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable but is our first carbon-neutral Mac.
All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad, from the ultra portable iPad Mini built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go, and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup.
Wearables, home, and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner, more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips in watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work because we know how much it matters to our users.
We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2. And new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display.
Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process, and the incredibly talented director, Jon M. Chu, recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie ""Wicked"" to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan.
Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of ""Severance"" earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like ""The Studio"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors."" And we can't wait for the premiere of ""Formula 1"" starring Brad Pitt on June 27th, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV Plus continues to draw attention and accolades.
Today, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an AirTag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season.
We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. And we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members.
There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was in AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment.
Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature, like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential.
We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.

Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue, with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track.
Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year over year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our install base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets.
Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year over year.
This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year over year. Operating cashflow is also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year.
We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan, and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone active install base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan.
We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year over year. We saw strength across our lineup, from the new Mac mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.
This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac install base reached an all-time high, and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S.
was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year over year, driven by the new iPad mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad install base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S.
based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year over year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we faced a difficult compare against the Watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch install base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.
Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our install base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future.
We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs with paid accounts growing double digits year over year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over a billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform.
We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness+, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises, such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S.
with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed thousands of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. And Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise with Cisco's new spatial meetings, delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning.
Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion.
During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.
The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar strengthens significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year. We expect services revenue to grow low double digits year over year.
When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.
Finally, today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13th, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions.

Thank you, Kevan. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring

Analyst
Great, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. You know, Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available. And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could, you know, better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already.
And then, I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Erik. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence that the year over year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments, from Writing Tools to Image Playground and Genmoji, to visual intelligence and more.
And so, we see all of those being used. The Clean Up is another one that is popular, and people love seeing that when demoed in the stores as well. We only had two, two and a half weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of 18.2. And then, only had the U.K.
and the other English language countries for the two and a half weeks. And so, we've got, you know, just the early indications at the moment. But we were glad --
Erik Woodring
--
Analyst
OK. That's really helpful.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Go ahead.
Erik Woodring
--
Analyst
OK. Thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently.
If we set aside China macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple Intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles? Just maybe double-clicking on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard -- as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year over year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And, of course, on the Apple Intelligence side, we have not rolled out in China.
And as we just talked about, we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And, of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so, all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in -- very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter.
There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20th. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smartwatches up to a certain maximum price point. And so, we do see fiscal stimulus occurring, and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.

Operator
Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes
--
Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And hey, Tim, wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute. And I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are are going to -- if anything's happened that changed your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway.
But I'd love your perspective on that, and then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And, you know, that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.
As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud, and which mimics from an architectural point of view what happens on device. And from a capex point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure, and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which, I think, continues to serve us well.
Ben Reitzes
--
Analyst
Great. All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like -- I guess, what do -- you know, you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future? Or do you feel that the -- you know, that the current lineup kind of shows where you're going? I guess, without pulling punches, wondering if you thought, in terms of the phone innovation, if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years.
Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
I think -- Ben, I think there's a lot more to come, and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. So, I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.
Ben Reitzes

Mike Ng

Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone operators, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now.
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to. Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The install base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16 compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15.
And so, I think you can conclude from that that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. So, lots --
Mike Ng

Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great, thank you, Tim. That's --
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, lots of good color there.
Mike Ng
--
Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great, thank you, Tim. That's very clear. And then, I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro.
You know, how did it help iPad sales overall? And what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter. And it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry-level iPad than it was the top-level iPad. But overall, we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%.
It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably, what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So, that tells us that, you know, there's a good amount of customers there to attract.

Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani
--
Analyst
Good afternoon everyone. I have two as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products. Can you just at a high level just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then, do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or, perhaps, starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know, from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there.
We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. We also -- the iPhone was the top-selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets, and so there's a huge market. And we have very modest share in these markets, and so I think there's lots of upside there.
And that's just one of the emerging markets.
Kevan Parekh
--
Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets, we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well, so that's also an encouraging sign.
Amit Daryanani
--
Analyst
Perfect. Thank you. And then, I guess, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margins flattish on a sequential basis.
Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margin? And, you know, Kevan, maybe you can just talk about is FX having an outside impact in your margin profile as well in March.
Kevan Parekh
--
Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Amit, let me take that one. You know, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5 %. So, we think we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes.
We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. It'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by, you know, favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also -- as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have, you know, a loss of leverage.
So, there are some puts and takes, and, you know, I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin.
Suhasini Chandramouli

Director, Investor Relations
Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan
--
Analyst
Yes, thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly channel inventory across your different product lines and regions. Do you feel they are elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess, in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter on quarter into the March quarter in China in particular? And I have a follow-up.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
You know, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region. But if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis, we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position. In China, my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. If you look -- part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter.
And so, we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.
Wamsi Mohan
--
Analyst
OK. That's very clear. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, thank you.
Wamsi Mohan
--
Analyst
And then, maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong, and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. So, how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that, let's say, you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.
Kevan Parekh
--
Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I think, one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter at 14%. And that was a -- one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad-based across all of our services. So, we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio.
And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board. And as well, you know, we continue to see, you know, increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about, you know, reaching all-time highs. And we have over now a billion paid subscriptions across the services platform.

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads, both. And I'm just curious in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines.
And more interest also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where, I think, there's a lot of conversation around AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16%. And on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by a very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air.
And so, as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac, and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so, I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.

And I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of more diversification of the supply chain. And how should we sort of think about that strategy related to that particular country? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, if you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export. And so, in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in-country. And so, that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.

Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. So, maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business.
But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter and if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year. So, how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then, second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, you know, obviously, it's done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of on the services side at least where margins could go -- it looks like, you know, the 75% margin spending, incredibly successful quarter, but just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the -- you know, over the intermediate term? Thank you.
Timothy Donald Cook

Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, if you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so, that gives us a, you know, positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say that I think I mentioned earlier is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so, that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family.
And so, I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so, it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.
Kevan Parekh
--
Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, great. Hi, David, how are you? So, on the services gross margin, I think maybe stepping back a second, you know, services business in general is -- in aggregate, is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things is an important reminder is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles.
And so, I think one is because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so, one of the big factors that drives the services gross margins are relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being, you know, accretive to margins as well.
And so, in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver, you know, that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration, you know, what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint at 46.5 to 47.5, which, again, we think is a strong guide.

Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar
--
Analyst
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim.
You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year over year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that is driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Mac.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling. The M4-based products are so compelling that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level, and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so, we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products.
Krish Sankar
--
Analyst
Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then, a follow-up for Kevan on the growth margin.
I want to ask you more on the product side. You know, last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to the year-ago period. I'm kind of curious, how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?
Kevan Parekh
--
Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, thanks, Krish, for the question. So, on the product side, as you mentioned, you know, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points for the December quarter. You know, that was really driven by -- we talked about favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume.
I would say, in general, you know, our gross margin of products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the, you know, various product launches that we have, different products do have different margin profiles. And so, that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mixes across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate toward our pro products, you know, because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get, you know, into our best products, which have, you know, favorable gross margins.
So, we're continuing to see that trend, you know, the impact of this in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so, you know, we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then, you know, that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter.
But we figured, you know, that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave in the 46.5% to 47.5%.

Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer

Arete Research -- Analyst
Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess, do you see this simply as a question of time, i.e., to launch more markets and languages, or increase the percentage of install base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend toward AI.
And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so, as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow.
And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get hundreds of emails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So, I think it's a combination of that. And, of course, in April we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further.
Richard Kramer
--
Arete Research -- Analyst
OK, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability is fairly stable. What observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlock potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?
Kevan Parekh
--
Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's a good question. I think, you know, one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean, we always take into consideration, you know, looking at short-term, you know, comparisons between short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy which would serve us pretty well.
And I think we're going to, you know, continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.

Timothy Donald Cook

I think the killer feature is different for different people. And -- but I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day. And, certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months.

Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts in how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. And, in particular, curious if you look at the strengths you saw in fiscal '21 and how that might support, you know, accelerated refresh opportunity into the future.
Timothy Donald Cook
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean, you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently. And then, you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. And most people are between those two points.
And so, I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories.

Management confirmed iPhone growth in every region, and noted the highest-ever iPhone installed base and upgrader record for Mainland China.
U.S. supply chain investments include $0.5 billion with MP Materials and the opening of an Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit as part of a $500 billion U.S. commitment over the next four years.
Guidance includes a gross margin range lowered by the expected $1.1 billion tariff cost and operating expenses as high as $15.8 billion.
AI development is prioritized, with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features released and continued significant increases in resource allocation and capital expenditure.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Timothy D. Cook:
Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are proud to report a June quarter revenue record of $94 billion, up 10% from a year ago, which was better than we expected. EPS set a June quarter record of $1.57, up 12% year-over-year. We saw an acceleration of growth around the world in the vast majority of markets we track, including Greater China and many emerging markets. And we had June quarter revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. These results were driven by double-digit growth across iPhone, Mac and Services.
We set a June quarter record for iPhone, which grew a strong 13% year-over-year. We saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in emerging markets, including India, the Middle East, South Asia and Brazil. Mac continued to see excellent results with revenue up 15% year-over-year. And we set another all-time revenue record in Services, which grew 13% with double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Last month, we hosted WWDC, an incredible event for our developer community with millions joining us online and more than 1,000 developers here in person at Apple Park.
We shared some truly exciting updates, including a stunning new design crafted from a material we call Liquid Glass, it's both beautiful and expressive. And for the first time ever this design extends across all of our platforms. We can't wait for users everywhere to experience it this fall. And we were excited to share some updates across our AI work. We announced even more capabilities coming later this year, including live translation and Workout Buddy. In addition to those new features, we announced new support for a number of languages, and we opened up access to the on-device foundation models at the core of Apple Intelligence, enabling developers to build a whole new experience for our users.
It's wonderful to see great momentum building for our platforms. iOS 26, macOS 26 and iPadOS 26 are by far the most popular developer betas we've had. Taking a step back, we see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments. Apple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone. And that's at the heart of our AI strategy. With Apple Intelligence, we're integrating AI features across our platforms in a way that is deeply personal, private and seamless, right where users need them.
We've already released more than 20 Apple Intelligence features, including visual intelligence, cleanup and powerful writing tools. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and as we've said before, we expect to release these features next year. Apple silicon is at the heart of all of these experiences, enabling powerful Apple Intelligence features to run directly on device. For more advanced tasks, our servers also powered by Apple silicon deliver even greater capabilities while preserving user privacy through our private cloud compute architecture. We believe our platforms offer the best way for users to experience the full potential of generative AI.
Thanks to the exceptional performance of our systems, our users are able to run generative AI models right on their Mac, iPad and iPhone. We're excited about the work we're doing in this space, and it's incredibly rewarding to see the strong momentum building. Now let me turn to more details about our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% from a year ago, and we set a June quarter record for upgraders. This strong broad-based performance was driven by the incredible popularity of the iPhone 16 family, which was up strong double digits year-over-year as compared to the 15 family. We also recently marked a significant milestone.
We shipped the 3 billionth iPhone since its launch in 2007. From the Pro models with the powerhouse A18 Pro and innovative Pro camera features to the iPhone 16e with breakthrough battery life and a 2-in-1 camera system, users are finding so many reasons to love the best iPhone lineup we've ever created. And iOS 26 will take that experience even further. In addition to the beautiful new design and powerful Apple Intelligence features, it introduces a range of meaningful updates like real-time call screening and hold assist in the phone app, smarter messaging tools and new live translation features.
It all adds up to a smarter, more personal iPhone experience that we can't wait for users everywhere to enjoy this fall. In Mac, we had another strong quarter with revenue of $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, largely driven by the strength of the M4 MacBook Air. We set a June quarter record for upgraders on Mac, and we saw great performance in emerging markets with strong double-digit growth on revenue as well as strong double-digit growth on both upgraders and customers new to Mac. MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop, unlocks a whole new level of performance with the power of M4.
MacBook Pro customers meanwhile continue to be drawn to its incredible power and the longest battery life we've ever had on a Mac. Customers are also loving the newest Mac Studio, which is the most powerful Mac we've ever made with next-level capabilities to tackle even the most demanding AI workflows. At the same time, Mac mini continues to win over customers by packing so much performance into an ultracompact design. And with fantastic new updates in macOS Tahoe 26 6 from the phone app to live activities to our biggest ever update to Spotlight, Mac users across our entire lineup are going to find delightful new ways to stay connected and productive.
For iPad, June quarter revenue was $6.6 billion. Our incredibly versatile iPad lineup brings together power and portability like never before. And users are already excited for our biggest iPad software update ever with the upcoming release of iPadOS 26. It starts with a new windowing system that's remarkably intuitive, giving users more control than ever of their iPad experience. An enhanced files app makes it easier than ever to stay organized. And that's all on top of a beautiful new software design that brings these updates to life. Turning to Wearables, Home and Accessories. Revenue was $7.4 billion, and we saw a June quarter record for upgraders to Apple Watch.
During the quarter, we marked the 10-year anniversary of Apple Watch, celebrating a decade of helping users navigate their health and fitness journeys. And with watchOS 26 Apple Watch will be more intelligent than ever with smart updates to the workout app and Smart Stack, along with a fresh new design that feels both dynamic and personal. We're also thrilled about what's coming to Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 26 introducing spatial widgets that let users customize their digital space, more life-like personas and new enterprise APIs that empower companies to build their own spatial experiences.
And this fall, new features for our latest AirPods lineup will unlock even more possibilities from studio quality audio recording to using AirPods as a camera remote, giving users powerful new ways to capture content and stay connected. As we're innovating across our lineup, we're especially proud of the work we're doing to help our users live healthier lives. Since we first launched our hearing health features for AirPods Pro 2, I've received notes from people who are delighted to be able to connect more deeply with loved ones.
Whether it's with AirPods Pro 2 or Apple Watch or iPhone, it's amazing to see the power of our health and safety features from hearing tests to fall detection alerts to irregular rhythm notifications having such a profound impact. Turning to Services. Revenue for the June quarter was $27.4 billion, up 13% from a year ago and an all-time record. Apple TV+ scored 81 nominations, a record for the platform across nearly every eligible category for this year's Emmy Awards. Severance leads all Emmy nominees with 27 nominations and The Studio follows close behind with 23 nominations, more than any other freshman comedy series ever.
It's amazing to see how these and other Apple TV shows have captured the popular imagination. To date, Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,700 award nominations and 585 wins on the strength of the highest-rated original content of any streaming network. And we continue to see very positive trends in the June quarter with TV+ viewership up strong double digits year-over-year. In June, we were also thrilled to release F1 in theaters around the world, one of the summer's most unforgettable blockbusters. During the quarter, we celebrated a big anniversary with 10 years of Apple Music. To mark the occasion, we launched an all-new studio space in Los Angeles for artists to create content and connect with fans.
And later this year, we're bringing Apple Music users even more to love from an enhanced listening experience with AutoMix, which mixes songs like a DJ to lyrics translation and more. The App Store meanwhile continues to be the very best place to discover the latest apps from developers around the world in a safe and trusted way and App Store revenue grew double digits year-over-year, setting a June quarter record. In retail, we continue to find opportunities in emerging markets to connect with even more customers. We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn't be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year.
We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka. Across everything we do at Apple, we show up by leading with our values. We feel strongly that the benefits of technology should be shared by everyone. That's why we make technology for everyone. In May, to mark Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we announced updates to help users learn, connect and interact with their worlds, including magnifier for Mac, a new braille experience and accessibility reader, a new system-wide reading mode to make it easier to understand content.
And we're proud to introduce accessibility nutrition labels, giving users an understanding of accessibility features before they download an app while helping developers educate people on features their app support. This month, we also announced a $0.5 billion commitment with MP Materials to strengthen the supply of vital recycled rare earth materials in the U.S. and support American industry. And in August, we're opening our all-new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit to train and support American manufacturers. These investments are part of Apple's largest ever spend commitment, which we announced earlier this year.
Over the next 4 years, Apple is investing $500 billion in the U.S., driving innovation and creating jobs in cutting-edge fields like advanced manufacturing, silicon engineering and artificial intelligence. We're proud of this work and all that we're doing to tap into American innovation and bring the best technology experiences to users across the globe. And we continue to look for further opportunities to do even more. Finally, the situation around tariffs is evolving, so let me provide some color there. For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs.
For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates. We're really proud of our results for the June quarter, and I want to thank our teams and our customers. In everything we do, we're driven by transformative innovation, delivering the most exceptional products and services we've ever created, and we're especially excited about what's ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.
Kevan Parekh:
Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenue of $94 billion was up 10% year-over-year and is a new June quarter record. We grew in every geographic segment and in the vast majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $66.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth across iPhone and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached another all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year and an all-time record. We saw strength across the world with double-digit growth in the majority of our markets.
Company gross margin was 46.5% at the high end of our guidance range and down 60 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by approximately $800 million in tariff-related costs Tim mentioned earlier. Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 140 basis points sequentially, driven by mix and tariff-related costs, partly offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 75.6%, down 10 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses landed at $15.5 billion, up 8% year- over-year. This strong business performance led to June quarter records for both net income at $23.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.57, which was up 12% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $27.9 billion.
Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $44.6 billion, up 13% year-over- year, driven by the iPhone 16 family. As Tim noted, we saw iPhone growth in every geographic segment and double-digit growth in many emerging markets. The iPhone active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and we reached a June quarter record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Worldpanel, formerly of Kantar, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, the U.K., Australia and Japan during the June quarter.
And we continue to see very high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 98% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $8 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by continued strength across the portfolio, including MacBook Air, Mac mini and MacBook Pro. We grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in Europe, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high, and we hit a June quarter record for upgraders.
In the U.S., customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97%. iPad revenue was $6.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year, which was expected given the difficult compare against the launch of the iPad Air and iPad Pro in the year ago quarter. At the same time, the iPad installed base reached another all-time high and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. And based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.4 billion, down 9% year-over-year. This was driven by a difficult compare on accessories due to the prior year's iPad launches that I just referred to.
The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We also set a quarterly record for upgraders on Apple Watch and the latest customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was reported at 97%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $27.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. The performance in the June quarter was broad-based. We saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of the categories, including cloud services, where we reached an all-time revenue record, driven by the year-over-year growth of iCloud paying accounts.
We saw strong momentum during the June quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continued to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all- time highs with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our Service offerings from the new Apple Games app to a continued expansion of Tap to Pay and Wallet. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are continuing to invest in Apple products to drive employee innovation and productivity.
With companies like PayPal and Roche deploying more Macs for their workforce, we had the best June quarter ever for Mac in enterprise. In Thailand, Siam Commercial Bank, one of the largest Thai banks, has deployed thousands of iPads across their branches to enhance the quality and efficiency of their banking operations from loan services to wealth management. CAE, a leader in pilot training and simulation technology is using Apple Vision Pro to enable pilots to become more familiar with aircraft procedures, leading to more productive in-person flight simulator training outcomes. Let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities.
We had $5.7 billion of debt maturities, issued $4.5 billion of new debt and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $102 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $31 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21 billion through open market repurchases of 104 million Apple shares. As we move into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to.
Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that the global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call, the global macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from today and the current revenue share agreement with Google continues. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow mid- to high single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the June quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%, which includes the estimated impact of the $1.1 billion tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.6 billion and $15.8 billion.
We expect OI&E to be around negative $25 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on August 14, 2025, to shareholders of record as of August 11, 2025. With that let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli:
Thank you, Kevan.
[Operator Instructions]
. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator:
Certainly, we'll go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Ng:
I just have one on upgrade rates and one on CapEx. First, on the upgrade rates, it's encouraging to see the records on iPhone, Mac and Watch. I was wondering if you're seeing strength in the upgrade rates? Or is the records more a function of the growing installed base? What is your research showing that made upgrades particularly compelling this year? For example, is it product features, tariff pull forward, perhaps Apple Intelligence? And then I'll give my follow-up on CapEx.
Timothy D. Cook:
You'll do CapEx first.
Kevan Parekh:
Yes, I'll do CapEx first.
Michael Ng:
Just on the CapEx, it's up notably year-to-date. Could you just comment on your capital spending plan this year and next and provide some qualitative color in terms of what's driving that growth? Is it AI-related or supply chain diversification, for instance?
Kevan Parekh:
Yes, Mike, it's a combination of factors. I would say, a pretty significant driver as Tim talked about, is the fact we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. So that is certainly a component of it. As you know, we've been investing in private cloud compute, which is also in our first-party data centers. The other piece, as you know, is we do have a hybrid strategy where in cases we do use third parties to make capital investments, and we also invest in our own. So you are going to see an increase in CapEx.
We also, from time to time, have other investments in facilities, in toolings, but I would say a significant portion of the driver of growth that you're seeing now is really driven by some of our AI-related investments.
Timothy D. Cook:
On the upgrades, Michael, if you look at iPhone, the 16 family grew double digit as opposed to the 15 family from the year ago quarter. And so we did set an upgrade record. I think it directly is because of the strength of the product. Mac also set records on upgrade, and I think we continue to see a move to Apple silicon and the performance of Apple silicon is playing a very key role. And so it was an incredible quarter.
In terms of -- if you're wondering about pull forward, we would estimate the pull forward of demand into April, specifically to be about 1 point of the 10 points in terms of people buying because of discussions about tariffs.
Operator:
Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.
Erik William Richard Woodring:
I have two as well. Tim maybe starting with you, shortly after March quarter earnings, there were some reports about searches on Safari declining in April for the first time, I think, in over 2 decades. Judging by your 13% Services growth this quarter, it doesn't seem to indicate that April trends necessarily played out through the remainder of the June quarter. And so I'm really just looking for a little bit more color on really how the rest of the quarter played out. And if you believe Apple products as kind of search access points are losing their strategic value as AI platforms become more valuable, popular or increasing in strategic value. And then I have a follow-up.
Timothy D. Cook:
I think they continue to be very valuable. I think that consumers' behaviors are evolving, and we're monitoring it very closely.
Erik William Richard Woodring:
Okay. I appreciate that color. And then maybe second to that, I'd love if you could maybe elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in China. I think in an interview earlier this afternoon, you alluded to some of the promotions being tailwinds. But just bigger picture, if we take a step back in China, how would you characterize demand interest in the iPhone 16 and some of your other products? Is that shifting or maybe were some of the trends in the June quarter maybe a bit more onetime and unique in nature?
Timothy D. Cook:
Yes. We did grow in Greater China by 4% during the quarter versus the previous quarter, it was driven by an acceleration by iPhone, although we also had substantial growth on the Mac year-over-year. From a -- as you know, the government has placed certain subsidies that affects some of our products, not all of them, but there are some of them. And I think that had some effect. It was the first full quarter of the subsidy playing out, that cut in during a portion of the previous quarter. The other things I would say are that the installed base hit a record high in Greater China, and we set an all-time record for the iPhone installed base.
The iPhone upgraders in Mainland China set a record for the June quarter. And according to Worldpanel, which was formerly known as Kantar, iPhone had the top 3 models in Urban China, which is extraordinary. Also, if you look at the other products, Mac, iPad and Watch, the majority of customers that are buying in China Mainland were new to the product. So lots of good things there. And the other thing I would point out, which is an interesting point, The MacBook Air was the top-selling laptop model in all of China, and the Mac mini was the top-selling desktop model in all of China. So overall, a positive -- very positive quarter.
Operator:
Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.
Benjamin Alexander Reitzes:
I really appreciate it. I wanted to ask about Siri, Tim, and just overall AI investment. There's a perception that Siri is going to help drive other new products potentially that maybe where voice is quite needed. And just wondering how's your confidence towards launching that next year? Is there anything that's been done internally to increase that confidence? Is it tied to the investment? I just think folks would love to know a little bit more about your confidence in how that's going? And then I have a follow-up.
Timothy D. Cook:
Yes. Thanks for the question. We're making good progress on a more personalized Siri, and we do expect to release the features next year, as we had said earlier, our focus from an AI point of view is on putting AI features across the platform that are deeply personal, private and seamlessly integrated. And of course, we've done that with more than 20 Apple Intelligence features so far from visual intelligence to cleanup to writing tools and all the rest. We are significantly growing our investment, we did during the June quarter, we will again in the September quarter.
I'm not putting specific numbers behind that at this point, but you can probably tell from the guidance that things are moving up. We are also reallocating a fair number of people to focus on AI features within the company. That are -- we have a great team, and we're putting all of our energy behind it. In terms of other products, I don't want to really comment on specific other products. But we have an exciting road map ahead and I could not be more excited about it.
Benjamin Alexander Reitzes:
That's great, Tim. Just with regard to my second question, it's about the overall revenue guide. And I appreciate that you guide the best you can see it. But I just wanted to challenge it from a different way is, why would it decelerate if Services is staying the same at 13%. What -- is there a conservatism there? I would think even currency is just as favorable, if not more favorable. So why would it decelerate to the higher single digits from where you were in the quarter? Or is it just being conservative? And if there's something decelerating or comp, do you mind just pointing that out?
Kevan Parekh:
Yes, Ben, this is Kevan. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at the growth from Q3, we just reported to the mid- to high single-digit guide. I think you have to kind of keep in mind two components. The first is the effect of the tariff-related pull-ahead in demand that Tim referenced earlier, which we estimated to be about 1 point of the 10 points that we ended up doing in Q3. And then the other factor that I think you have to take into consideration is the fact that in September quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the iPad launches, which also leads to a difficult compare this year.
So those two components are things you have to take into consideration as you think about the move from Q3 to Q4. I would say foreign exchange is a very minor tailwind going from Q3 to Q4, so not really a major factor.
Operator:
Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. .
Wamsi Mohan:
Tim, I know you said similar growth in Services, and that's predicated with Google payments continuing. Is there any way for us to dimensionalize sort of -- or maybe just conceptually talk about maybe options if, if the counter were to happen, if the payments were not allowed in some way, what are some of the things that Apple could do given that it is a significant chunk of profitability? And I have a follow-up.
Timothy D. Cook:
Yes, Wamsi, I don't really want to speculate on the court ruling and how they would rule and what we would do as a consequence of it.
Wamsi Mohan:
Okay. Okay. I guess we'll wait for that ruling to come out. I guess, separately, Tim, at a high level, when you look at some of what is perceived fears of new form factors and ways to interact with devices. There was some worry that given some of the developments in AI that there could be a world where dependence on screen-based devices significantly diminishes. And I'm kind of curious to get your thoughts on if do you think that would happen and rate and pace in which? And how do you think Apple is preparing in that case?
Timothy D. Cook:
When you think about all the things an iPhone can do from connecting people to bringing app and game experiences to life to taking photos and videos to helping users explore the world and conduct their financial lives and pay for things and so much more. It's difficult to see a world where iPhone is not living in it. And that doesn't mean that we are not thinking about other things as well. But I think that, that the devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitution.
Operator:
Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani:
I guess just to start with -- Tim, the tariff assumption of $1.1 billion in the September quarter, I kind of -- I understand the uptick you folks are talking about. But can you just talk about assuming tariffs remain at these levels or even they evolve under Section 232, how do you eventually think about offsetting this headwind to your P&L? And when do you decide to execute on the levers to offset this headwind versus just flowing into your bottom line?
Timothy D. Cook:
Right now, we're just estimating the cost of it, and it's up quarter-over-quarter, because our volume is up quarter-over-quarter. And there was some build ahead in the previous quarter. And so that's the primary reason that it's up. In terms of what we do to mitigate, we obviously try to optimize our supply chain and ultimately, we're -- we will do more in the United States. We've committed $500 billion investment in the U.S. over the next 4 years. And we're already building chips in Arizona. And in fact, we're building semiconductors across 12 states in 24 factories, and have a lot of other things in the work. You probably saw the investment in MP Materials last week.
And so we continue to explore these things and look for more that we can do, which I think ultimately is the objective.
Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani:
Got it. Super helpful. And then your Services growth, I think, was extremely impressive at 13%, especially given all the fears folks had. Can you just touch on, did you see any impact that was notable from the Epic case and the steering dynamics that came after that? And maybe just touch on what does that appeal process looks like for you as you go forward? .
Kevan Parekh:
Yes, this is Kevan. Let me take that one. In general, I think just reminding, I think you just said, we had a very strong Services quarter, we had an all-time record at the $27.4 billion, up 13%. The one thing I would also say is our services performance was broad- based. So we also saw strength in developed and emerging markets, both parts of the world had double-digit growth. We also saw a sequential acceleration across the majority of our categories, including cloud services, where I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we had an all-time revenue record.
As it relates to the EPIC decision, we -- keep in mind, we only just introduced the change required by the court in the June quarter. And as you know, we don't provide the level of detail. But in general, I would say it was a very, very -- in the U.S., we had a double- digit growth for the U.S. App Store, and we set an all-time record. And so we'll continue to monitor the effects on our business, but we'll continue to innovate and ensure that the App Store delivers the best experience for users and remains a great business opportunity for developers.
Operator:
Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt:
And I have two questions as well. Maybe Tim, just on the supply chain strategy. I know last quarter, you talked about focusing production or assembly to India. And I just want to get an update on how you're thinking about the strategy holistically, given sort of the tariff rates, I think, in India potentially are higher than I think anyone had expected. So I know you mentioned some U.S. investments, would love to kind of get your thoughts on how you're thinking about China versus the rest of Southeast Asia and India going forward? And then I'll give you my second question also.
So Kevan, I'm just trying to understand a little bit more about the demand drivers of iPhone in the quarter because obviously, the 16 has been in the market for some time. I know there was some promotional activity. But seasonally, you generally don't see this kind of strength in the June quarter. Maybe you can help us understand outside of maybe the promotional activity, what else were some of the drivers that led to what was -- looks like a pretty significant above seasonal strength in the June quarter stats?
Timothy D. Cook:
Yes. In terms of the tariff situation and country of origin and so forth. One thing I would say, just to remind everyone is keep in mind that the vast majority of our products are covered under the Section 232 investigation. And so the -- today or I should say, last quarter, the bulk of the tariffs that we paid were the IEEPA tariffs that hit early in the year related to China. And so that's just a reminder of where things are and what we assumed as we calculated the projection of $1.1 billion that's in our outlook color. In terms of the country of origin, it's the same as I referenced last quarter.
There hasn't been a change to that, which is the vast majority of the iPhone sold in the U.S. or the majority, I should say, have a country of origin of India and the vast majority of the products, other products, the Mac and the iPad and the Watch have a country of origin of Vietnam that are sold in the United States. Still, the products for other international countries, the vast majority of them are coming from China. And so that hopefully gives you a flavor of the of where things are. But I would stress again that we do a lot in this country in the United States.
And we've committed $500 billion, and we're always looking to do more. And you could kind of see that in the most recent announcements, whether it's MP Materials or our manufacturing academy that we're standing up in Detroit in a couple of weeks or so. And so we're going to be doing -- we're doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the U.S. now, and we will do more, and of course, glass from iPhone and the Face ID module. And so there's loads of different things that are done in the United States.
Kevan Parekh:
And then, David, as...
David Vogt:
And then on the iPhone activity?
Kevan Parekh:
Yes. So I was going to mention the iPhone activity. You asked if there's any kind of unique characteristics this quarter? I would just say, as Tim outlined, we really believe that the strong upgrade performance, which was a June quarter record was really driven by the strength of the product lineup. The iPhone 16 family has done incredibly well compared to the iPhone 15 family. And we also, as you recall, recently introduced the 16e as well, which also continued to impact the success of the overall iPhone 16 lineup.
Operator:
Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.
Krish Sankar:
I have two of them. The first one is for Kevan, this was a previous question, do you think there was any pull-in of iPhones in the June quarter that led to some of the upside? And how to think about channel inventory in June quarter? And how it looks in September relative to seasonal trends? And then I had a longer-term follow-up for Tim.
Timothy D. Cook:
Let me see if I can answer the channel inventory question or what I think is the channel inventory question. If you look at iPhone channel inventory from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, we reduced it, and it ended toward the low end of our targeted range. And so that's the answer on the inventory piece of it.
Kevan Parekh:
And then I think you also asked about the pull-ahead impact. I think we referenced that earlier. Just to be clear on what we believe we saw in the June quarter, we did see some obvious signs of pull-ahead really in the April time frame around the tariff-related discussions that were out in the marketplace. And so we felt that, that was from what we saw about a 1 point impact of the 10 points at a total company level of growth. And so that was the limited impact that we believe we saw for the quarter.
Krish Sankar:
Got it. Very helpful. And then I just have like a long-term follow-up for Tim. Tim, I'm kind of curious about your thoughts on AI for edge devices. There's like some people who think that LLM could be a commodity in the future. Do you think -- do you see a scenario where the LLMs become a core part of your iOS or is the SLM the way to go and how to think about evolution of edge devices in a futuristic AI world and if smartphone going to be the choice of device. Just curious your thoughts on it, broadly speaking.
Timothy D. Cook:
The way that we look at AI is that it's one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. And I think it will affect all devices in a significant way. What pieces of the chain are commoditized and not commoditized, I wouldn't want to really talk about today because that gives away some things on our strategy. But I think it's a good question.
Operator:
Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee:
Tim, maybe if I can start with your remarks about the pull-ahead being about a 1 percentage point benefit here. Anything to share in terms of how -- what's underlying that estimate in terms of what you're seeing for -- is it a pull-ahead largely on iPhones? Or is it across the board? And is it primarily in the U.S. or again, sort of across multiple regions? Any color there would be helpful in terms of how you're sort of getting to that assumption there. And I have a follow-up.
Timothy D. Cook:
It was principally on iPhone and Mac. And it was pretty -- it was obvious evidence of it. It was an unusual buying pattern there and that largely occurred in April towards the beginning of the quarter. And it was really -- we believe it was largely the United States.
Samik Chatterjee:
Okay. Okay. Got it. And maybe on the tariff front, when you gave the estimate of $900 million last quarter, which came in at $800 million, you did highlight it was -- there were some unique factors in the quarter. When I take the $1.1 billion that you're now sort of expecting for the September quarter and as we start to think about December, would -- is there anything unique in the December quarter in terms of sourcing from regions, et cetera, that would uniquely impact December, just given sort of that you had highlighted that quarter-to-quarter, so there would be unique things. Just curious if December looks very different from September because of any unique factors.
Timothy D. Cook:
I would be careful about projecting based on the numbers from Q2 and Q3 because, one, we're uncertain of what the rates will be. And so the rates may change. Two, in -- particularly in last quarter, we had some build ahead inventory that we were -- that we had within the company and within our supplier -- within our supply chain. And so those two are a little unique. Also, as you know, from following us for so long, Q1 is generally a higher volume quarter. And the tariffs are currently are pretty linear with volume.
Operator:
Our next question is from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.
Aaron Christopher Rakers:
I've got two as well, and I'll just ask them together. I guess the first one is just more housekeeping. Kevan, when we think about currency impact, how much of a benefit was currency this quarter, and I guess across the business and in particular, maybe on the Services segment, and on a year-on-year basis, how much currency benefit should we be thinking about embedded in the guidance into the September quarter? And then the second quick question is CapEx is clearly moving higher. I know you guys don't guide specifically to that number.
But just kind of qualitatively, should we -- as you lean in more on AI, should we really start to see that CapEx, which is running close to about $4 billion annualized today, really start to move appreciably higher? Any color on that would be helpful.
Kevan Parekh:
Great, Aaron. Thanks for the questions. Let me answer the first one, first around foreign exchange. For Q3, we really had no impact from a foreign exchange standpoint on the year-on-year results. And so -- when we look at both the revenue growth as well as the gross margin, there was virtually no impact from foreign exchange. As we look at going from Q3 to June quarter to the September quarter, again, very, very, as I mentioned earlier, a very small tailwind going from Q3 to Q4 from a foreign exchange standpoint on both revenue as well as gross margin.
And then on the second question, sure, on the CapEx side, I think we talked about the fact that we are, and Tim mentioned the fact that we are increasing our investment significantly in AI. You are going to continue to see our CapEx grow. It's not going to be exponential growth, but it is going to grow substantially. And a lot of that's a function of the investments we're making in AI. As we mentioned, we also have other items that fall under that category, facilities and some of our retail store investments. But I would say a lot of the growth is really being driven by AI.
I would remind you that we do have a hybrid model though, where we also leverage third-party infrastructure in addition to investing in our own first-party infrastructure.
Operator:
Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.
Atif Malik:
Tim, at the WWDC earlier in the quarter, you showed impressive updates on Vision Pro with the use of widget, spatial scenes, persona and new ways to create content. Appears like Meta and Xiaomi are seeing strong momentum on their AI glasses. So is the focus still around enterprises on Vision Pro? Or are you thinking of broadening the use cases and maybe tying it to more of your devices? Any thoughts on Vision Pro as they did not get enough airtime in the prepared remarks.
Timothy D. Cook:
Yes. Thanks for bringing it up. I was thrilled with the release from the team on visionOS 26. It includes many things in it like spatial widgets to enable users to customize their digital space. The personas took a huge increase. They're much more lifelike. And of course, there's new enterprise APIs for companies as well. And we're seeing, as Kevan talked about in his opening remarks, we're seeing those things resonate out with CAE and other customers. And so we continue to be very focused on it. And I don't want to get into the road map on it, but this is an area that we really believe in.
Atif Malik:
Great. And Kevan, historically, you guys have not done much big M&A. Do you feel like you need to accelerate your AI road map or just keep the organic focus?
Timothy D. Cook:
Let me take that one as well. We've acquired around seven companies this year. And that's companies from all walks of life, not all AI oriented. And so we're doing one, think of it as one every several weeks. We're very open to M&A that accelerates our road map. We are not stuck on a certain size company, although the ones that we have acquired thus far this year are small in nature. But we basically ask ourselves whether a company can help us accelerate a road map. If they do, then we're interested, but we don't have anything to share specifically today.
Suhasini Chandramouli:

Vice President, Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer; Amy Hood, chief financial officer; Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer; and Keith Dolliver, corporate secretary and deputy general counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We have recast certain prior period amounts to reflect the FY '25 changes to the composition of our segments announced in August 2024.
Additional details, including FY '23 and FY '24 recast segment revenue, operating income, and product and service level revenue can be found in the financial statements filed on the Investor Relations website. More detailed outlook slides will also be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only.
We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website.
During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Brett. We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22%. AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts and workflow across every role, function, and business process, helping customers drive new growth and operating leverage. All up, our AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which will make it the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone.
Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure took share this quarter. We are seeing continued growth in cloud migration. Azure Arc now has over 39,000 customers across every industry, including American Tower, CTT, L'Oréal, up more than 80% year-over-year.
We now have data centers in over 60 regions around the world. And this quarter, we announced new cloud and AI infrastructure investments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Sweden as we expand our capacity in line with our long-term demand signals. At the silicon layer, our new Cobalt 100 VMs are being used by companies like Databricks, Elastic, Siemens, Snowflake and Synopsys to power their general-purpose workloads at up to 50% better price performance than previous generations. On top of this, we are building out our next-generation AI infrastructure, innovating across the full stack to optimize our fleet for AI workloads.
We offer the broadest selection of AI accelerators, including our first-party accelerator, Maia 100 as well as the latest GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA. In fact, we are the first cloud to bring up NVIDIA's Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. Our partnership with OpenAI also continues to deliver results. We have an economic interest in a company that has grown significantly in value, and we have built differentiated IP and are driving revenue momentum.
More broadly with Azure AI, we are building an end-to-end app platform to help customers build their own copilots and agents. Azure OpenAI usage more than doubled over the past 6 months as both digital natives like Grammarly and Harvey as well as established enterprises like Bajaj Finance, Hitachi, KT, and LG move apps from test to production. GE Aerospace, for example, used Azure OpenAI to build a new digital assistant for all 52,000 of its employees. In just 3 months, it has been used to conduct over 500,000 internal queries and process more than 200,000 documents.
And this quarter, we added support for OpenAI's newest model family, o1. We're also bringing industry-specific models through Azure AI, including a collection of best-in-class multimodal models for medical imaging. And with the GitHub models, we now provide access to our full model catalog directly within the GitHub developer workflow. Azure AI is also increasingly an on-ramp to our data and analytics services.
As developers build new AI apps on Azure, we have seen an acceleration of Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL DB hyperscale usage as customers like Air India, Novo Nordisk, Telefonica, Toyota Motor North America and Uniper take advantage of capabilities purpose built for AI applications. And with Microsoft Fabric, we provide a single AI-powered platform to help customers like Chanel, EY, KPMG, Swissair and Syndigo unify their data across clouds. We now have over 16,000 paid Fabric customers, over 70% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers.
GitHub Copilot is changing the way the world builds software. Copilot enterprise customers increased 55% quarter-over-quarter as companies like AMD and Flutter Entertainment tailor Copilot to their own code base. And we are introducing the next phase of AI code generation, making GitHub Copilot agentic across the developer workflow. GitHub Copilot Workspace is a developer environment, which leverages agents from start to finish so developers can go from spec to plan to code all in natural language.
Copilot Autofix is an AI agent that helps developers at companies like Asurion and Auto Group fix vulnerabilities in their code over three times faster than it would take them on their own. We're also continuing to build on GitHub's open platform ethos by making more models available via GitHub Copilot. And we are expanding the reach of GitHub to a new segment of developers introducing GitHub Spark, which enables anyone to build apps in natural language. Already, we have brought generative AI to Power Platform to help customers use low-code, no-code tools to cut costs and development time.
To date, nearly 600,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up four times year-over-year. Citizen developers at ZF, for example, built apps simply by describing what they need using natural language. And this quarter, we introduced new ways for customers to apply AI to streamline complex workflows with Power Automate. Now on to work.
We launched the next wave of Microsoft 365 Copilot innovation last month, bringing together web, work, and Pages as the new design system for knowledge work. Pages is the first new digital artifact for the AI age, and it's designed to help you ideate with AI and collaborate with other people. We've also made Microsoft 365 Copilot responses two times faster and improved response quality by nearly 3x. This innovation is driving accelerated usage, and the number of people using Microsoft 365 daily more than doubled quarter-over-quarter.
We are also seeing increased adoption from customers in every industry as they use Microsoft 365 Copilot to drive real business value. Vodafone, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 68,000 employees after a trial showed that, on average, they save 3 hours per person per week. And UBS will deploy 50,000 seats in our largest finserve deal to date. And we continue to see enterprise customers coming back to buy more seats.
All up, nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, and customers continue to adopt it at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. Copilot is the UI for AI, and with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio and agents and now autonomous agents, we have built an end-to-end system for AI business transformation. With Copilot Studio, organizations can build and connect Microsoft 365 Copilot to autonomous agents, which then delegate to Copilot when there is an exception. More than 100,000 organizations from Nsure, Standard Bank and Thomson Reuters to Virgin Money and Zurich Insurance have used Copilot Studio to date, up over two times quarter-over-quarter.
More broadly, we are seeing AI drive a fundamental change in the business applications market as customers shift from legacy apps to AI-first business processes. Dynamics 365 continues to take share as organizations like Evron, Heineken and Lexmark chose our apps over other providers. And monthly active users of Copilot across our CRM and ERP portfolio increased over 60% quarter-over-quarter. Our Dynamics 365 contact center is also winning customers like Currys, Le Creuset and RXO as it brings generative AI to every customer engagement channel.
And just last week, we added 10 out-of-the-box autonomous agents to Dynamics 365 that helps customers automatically qualify sales leads, track suppliers and work hand in hand with service reps to resolve issues. We're also bringing AI to industry-specific workflows. One year in, DAX Copilot is now documenting over 1.3 million physician-patient encounters each month at over 500 healthcare organizations like Baptist Medical Group, Baylor Scott & White, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Novant Health and Overlake Medical Center. It is showing faster revenue growth than GitHub Copilot did in this first year.
And new features extend DAX beyond notes, helping physicians automatically draft referrals, after-visit instructions, and diagnostic evidence. On top of all this AI innovation, Microsoft Teams usage remains at all-time highs as people use it to streamline all their communications. Nearly 75% of our Teams Enterprise customers now buy Premium, Phone or Rooms. When it comes to Windows, our new class of Copilot+ PCs is winning new customers.
They offer best-in-class AI capability, performance, and value. AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm now all support Copilot+ PCs. This quarter, we also introduced new AI experience only available on Copilot+ PCs like Click to Do, which places an interactive overlay over your desktop to suggest next best actions. And as we approach the end of support for Windows 10 a year from now, we are well positioned to transition our customers to Windows 11, ensuring they benefit from enhanced features and security improvements we've introduced over the past few years.
Now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. With our Secure Future Initiative, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to address the highest-priority security tasks. We have made significant progress to better protect tenants' identities, networks, and engineering systems, and we have created new processes to ensure security is prioritized at every level of the company.
And we continue to take what we learn and turn it into innovations across our products. Security Copilot, for example, is being used by companies in every industry, including Clifford Chance, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Shell to perform SecOps tasks faster and more accurately. And we are now helping customers protect their AI deployments, too. Customers have used Defender to discover and secure more than 750,000 GenAI app instances and used Purview to audit over 1 billion Copilot interactions to meet their compliance obligations.
And all up, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve and are consistently recognized by top analysts as a leader in 20 categories more than any other vendor. Now let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Member growth continues to accelerate with markets in India and Brazil both growing at double digits. We are also seeing record engagement as we introduce new ways for our more than 1 billion members to connect, sell services, get hired and share knowledge.
Our investments in rich formats like video strengthen our leadership in B2B advertising and amplify the value we deliver to our customers. Weekly immersive video views increased six times quarter-over-quarter, and total video viewership on LinkedIn is up 36% year-over-year. Our AI-powered tools also continue to transform how people sell, learn and hire. In Sales, new AI features help every team member perform at the level of top sellers and drive more profitable growth.
In Learning, just yesterday, we announced updates to our coaching experience, including personalized career development plans. LinkedIn's first agent hiring assistant will help hirers find qualified candidates faster by tackling the most time-consuming task. Already hirers who use AI assistant messages see a 44% higher acceptance rate compared to those who don't. And our hiring business continues to take share.
Now on to Search, Advertising and News. With Copilot, we are seeing the first step toward creating a new AI companion for everyone with new Copilot experience we introduced earlier this month, includes a refreshed design and tone along with improved speed and fluency across the web and mobile. And it includes advanced capabilities like voice and vision that make it more delightful and useful and feel more natural. You can both browse and converse with Copilot simultaneously because Copilot sees what you see.
More broadly, AI is also transforming search, browsers, and digital advertising, and we continue to take share across Bing and Edge. Bing ex TAC revenue growth outpaced the search market. Now on to Gaming. One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services.
You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger.
Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day 1 players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our commercial and consumer businesses.
In 3 weeks' time, we will hold our Ignite Conference, and I look forward to sharing more then about how we are helping every business function use AI to drive growth in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $65.6 billion, up 16%, and earnings per share was $3.30, an increase of 10%. With strong execution by our sales teams and partners, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year with double-digit top and bottom line growth.
We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand, and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30% and 23% in constant currency. Results were driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365.
Additionally, we also saw an increase in the number of $100-million-plus contracts for Azure. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 22% and 21% in constant currency to $259 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 27%.
And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 98%. In addition to commercial results that were in line with expectations, we also saw some benefit from in-period revenue recognition across Microsoft 365 commercial, Azure, and our on-premises server business. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth with a 2 point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.05 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party and includes $911 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.
FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $38.9 billion and grew 22%, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year to 71%. This was slightly better than expected due to improvement in Azure, although the gross margin percentage decrease year-over-year continues to be driven by scaling our AI infrastructure.
Company gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was 69%, down 2 points year-over-year, driven by the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier as well as the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 12%, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies and ongoing prioritization work. Operating expense growth included 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 8% higher than a year ago.
Excluding the growth from the Activision acquisition, headcount was 2% higher. Operating income increased 14% and operating margins were 47%, down 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the net impact from the Activision acquisition, operating margins were up 1 point as we continue to drive efficiencies across our businesses as we invest in AI infrastructure and capabilities. Now to our segment results.
Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $28.3 billion and grew 12% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all businesses. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 15% and 16% in constant currency with business trends that were as expected. The better-than-expected result was due to a small benefit from the in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. ARPU growth was primarily driven by E5 as well as M365 Copilot.
Paid M365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial cloud revenue represents nearly 90% of total M365 commercial products and cloud services. M365 commercial products revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.
M365 consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, with continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 84.4 million. M365 consumer cloud revenue represents 85% of total M365 consumer products and cloud services. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all lines of business.
Dynamics revenue grew 14%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 18% and 19% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and continued share gains. As a reminder, Dynamics 365 represents about 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2%, and operating income increased 16%.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.1 billion, increasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 33% and 34% in constant currency, with healthy consumption trends that were in line with expectations. The better-than-expected result was due to the small benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier.
Azure growth included roughly 12 points from AI services similar to last quarter. Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity. Non-AI growth trends were also in line with expectations in total and across regions as customers continued to migrate and modernize on the Azure platform. The non-AI point contribution to Azure growth was sequentially lower by approximately 1 point.
In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1%. Lower-than-expected transactional purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2025 launch as well as lower purchasing of licenses running in multi-cloud environments was mostly offset by the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%, and gross margin percentage decreased 3 points year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure.
Operating expenses increased 8% and operating income grew 18%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.2 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by Gaming and Search.
Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 2% year-over-year as better-than-expected results in Windows OEM due to mix shift to higher monetizing markets was partially offset by the lower-than-expected results in devices due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 18% and 19% in constant currency ahead of expectations, primarily due to continued execution improvement. We saw rate expansion in addition to healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue increased 43% and 44% in constant currency with 43 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.
Results were ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in both first- and third-party content as well as consoles. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% with 53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year.
Our strong execution on margin improvement in gaming and search was offset by sales mix shift to those businesses. Operating expenses increased 49% with 51 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income decreased 4%. Now back to total company results.
Capital expenditures including finance leases were $20 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $14.9 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $34.2 billion, up 12%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier employee and tax payments.
Free cash flow was $19.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income expense was negative $283 million, significantly more favorable than anticipated due to foreign currency remeasurement and net gains on investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%.
And finally, we returned $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX.
With the weaker U.S. dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to have no meaningful impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q1 continue through Q2.
Customer demand for our differentiated solutions should drive another quarter of strong growth. In commercial bookings, we expect strong growth on a growing expiry base driven by increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.
We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand signals. As I said last quarter, we will stay aligned and if needed, adjust to the demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, segment guidance, starting with Productivity and Business Processes.
We are the market leader when it comes to knowledge-based copilots and agents in the enterprise space, and we are focused on continuing to gain share across our productivity solutions. Therefore, we expect revenue in Productivity and Business Processes to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency or USD 28.7 billion to USD 29 billion. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency with moderating seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot. For H2, we expect revenue growth to remain relatively stable compared to Q2.
We continue to see growth in M365 Copilot seats, and we expect the related revenue to continue to grow gradually over time. For M365 commercial products, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products include on-premises components of M365 suites, so our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits driven by M365 subscriptions.
For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads. Next, Intelligent Cloud. Helping our customers transform and grow with innovative cloud and AI solutions is driving continued growth in Azure.
Therefore, we expect revenue in Intelligent Cloud to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency or USD 25.55 billion to USD 25.85 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth to be 31% to 32% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history.
We expect the contribution from AI services to be similar to last quarter, given the continued capacity constraints as well as some capacity that shifted out of Q2. And in H2, we still expect Azure growth to accelerate from H1 as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. And in our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits on a prior year comparable that benefited from purchasing ahead of Windows Server 2012 end of support. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits.
Now to More Personal Computing. We continue to make decisions to prioritize strategic higher-margin opportunities within each of our consumer businesses. Our outlook reflects the improvement in gross and operating margins from this prioritization work across gaming, search, and devices. We expect revenue in More Personal Computing to be USD 13.85 billion to USD 14.25 billion.
Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in line with the PC market to be more than offset by a decline in devices as the trends from Q1 continue. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, with continued growth in both volume and revenue per search. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the high single digits.
And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits due to hardware. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be relatively flat. We're excited about last week's launch of Call of Duty, where we saw the most Game Pass subscriber adds we've ever seen on a launch day. There are two things about the launch that are different than the Call of Duty launch a year ago, where revenue was mostly recognized in the quarter of purchase.
First, the game is available on Game Pass, so for players who play through Game Pass, the subscription revenue is recognized over time. Second, the game requires an online connection to play, so even for players who purchased the stand-alone game, revenue recognition will also occur ratably over time. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or to be between USD 21.9 billion to USD 22.1 billion, and operating expense to grow approximately 7% in constant currency or to be between USD 16.4 billion and USD 16.5 billion.
This should result in another quarter of operating margin expansion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.5 billion, primarily driven by our share of the expected loss from OpenAI, which is accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. As you heard from Satya, our strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI has been pivotal in building and scaling our AI business and positioning us as the leader in the AI platform wave.
And lastly, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on strategically investing in the long-term opportunities that we believe drive shareholder value. Monetization from these investments continues to grow, and we're excited that only 2.5 years in, our AI business is on track to surpass $10 billion of annual revenue run rate in Q2. This will be the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone.
We are committed to growing this leadership position across our entire Microsoft Cloud while maintaining our disciplined focus on cost management and prioritization across every team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.

Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions. Congratulations on a really solid quarter. So Satya, the expansion of capabilities, the speed of innovation, the magnitude of the opportunities ahead for generative AI makes this the most exciting period for software I've seen in my 25 years of covering this space.
And based upon this call, it seems like you share that excitement. But in my investor conversation, that excitement also feeds two related questions, and they both have to do with constraints. And the first is like what are the internal constraints or guardrails that Microsoft has when it comes to investing behind these innovations, particularly in relation to the funding of future generations of foundational models, where people are talking about price tags using the tens of billions or even $100 billion plus. And then on the other side of the spectrum, what are the external constraints that Microsoft sees in building out this capacity to meet the demand and capture the opportunity, particularly constraints in your ability to power all these new data centers being built out and power it in an environmentally sustainable fashion? I'd love to get the Microsoft perspective on both those questions.

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Keith, for those questions. I think on the first point, ultimately, when you think about, let's say, capital outlay for training because that's essentially what you're asking, it is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference in a given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out cloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would then project the demand, and that's what we would build it for. So you can think of training essentially as that, right, which is you're building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand, right? So ultimately -- even with all the scaling laws and what have you, I think you ultimately will normalize to having a pace. In fact, I think the best way to think about even is given that Moore's Law effectively is working on the sort of silicon and system side, so it's just not compute, right? It's efficiencies in compute.
It's data as well as algorithms. You will want to sort of keep on that curve, which is you really want to refresh your fleet with the Moore's Law every year and then effectively depreciate it over the period of the life cycle of it. And then the inference demand ultimately will govern how much we invest in training because that's, I think, at the end of the day, you're all subject to ultimately demand. The second piece of the external constraints, we have run into obviously lots of external constraints because this demand all showed up pretty fast, right? I mean if you think about even the most hit product of this generation, all are in our cloud, right, whether it's ChatGPT, whether it's Copilot, whether it's GitHub Copilot or even DAX Copilot.
I mean pick the top 4 or 5 products of this generation. They're all sort of in and around our ecosystem. And so therefore, we ran into a set of constraints, which are everything because DCs don't get built overnight. So there is DCs.
There is power. And so that's sort of been the short-term constraint. Even in Q2, for example, some of the demand issues we have -- or our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving out. So that's the constraints we have.
But in the long run, we do need effectively power and we need DCs. And some of these things are more long lead. But I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply/demand will match up.

Thanks, Amy. Good to hear the reacceleration in the back half for Azure. I guess many are asking, 34% growth in Q1 falling to low 30s. I know the comp is a couple of points harder.
But is there anything else you're contemplating in that guide for Q2 to see that deceleration other than a tougher comp? Thank you.
Amy E. Hood
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a great question because I can sort of reiterate some of the points I made and tie them together a little bit. In Q1, the 34% in CC, we talked about that upside versus the 33% that we had guided to was primarily due to some revenue recognition benefits. And so I think about that on a sort of a pure consumption basis and AI as being 33%.
And you think about 1 point or 2 of decel that we've guided to, and the majority of that is due to, unfortunately, some supply pushouts that I mentioned and then Satya reiterated in terms of AI supply coming online that we counted on. The underlying consumption growth is stable Q1 to Q2. And so to your question on some ins and outs, it is certainly some ins and outs. I do, as you heard, have confidence, as we get a good influx of supply across the second half of the year particularly on the AI side, that we'll be better able to do some supply demand matching and hence, while we're talking about acceleration in the back half.
I'll also take the opportunity to say, when you see usage in AI workloads, we always intend to think about that as just a GPU exercise. The importance of having GPUs and CPUs be able to run these workloads is also important. So that's a piece of the acceleration in H2 as well.

Thank you very much for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. The question every investor obviously asks is a question on the capex growth and the capex spend. Obviously, half of that facility is an equivalent that have a longer life, but the other half is the rest of the components.
Can you give any color on how you think of that growth? Does it return to the traditional approach, where basically capex is going to grow in line or slightly slower than cloud revenue? And if so, any sense of the timing? Do we have enough facilities online by sometime next year, et cetera? Any color would be appreciated.
Amy E. Hood

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mark. I think in some ways, it's helpful to go back to the cloud transition that we worked on over a decade ago, I think, in the early stages. And what you did see, and you'll see us do in the same time is you have to build to meet demand. Unlike the cloud transition, we're doing it on a global basis in parallel as opposed to sequential given the nature of the demand.
And then as long as we continue to see that demand grow, you're right, the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase. And those 2 things, to your point, get closer and closer together over time. The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption. And to Satya's point, some of that spend goes toward building the next training infrastructure so you won't see all of it in COGS.
Some of it goes to opex when you're spending it on training. But in general, that's a healthy way to think about the balance as that over time does do and should, like the last cycle, get closer together.

OK. Great. Thank you. I'm actually not going to ask a question about the numbers, but Satya and Amy, I'd love to ask a question about OpenAI.
Since the print 3 months ago, we, investors have been hit with a torrent of media stories about OpenAI and Microsoft. And I'd love to give Microsoft an opportunity to frame the relationship. It seems to me it's critically important. But we have been, I think, everyone on the line, picking up signals that perhaps Microsoft wants to diversify somewhat at the model layer and offer customers choice.
So Satya, I'd love to get your framing of the relationship. And then in terms of the numbers, maybe this is a little bit more for you, Amy. But how does Microsoft manage the demands on capex from helping OpenAI with its scaling ambitions? And how do you manage the impact on other income that you just gave us some color on?
Satya Nadella
--
Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Thanks, Karl. So I'd say, first, the partnership for both sides, that's OpenAI and Microsoft, has been super beneficial. After all, we were the -- we effectively sponsored what is one of the most highest-valued private companies today when we invested in them and really took a bet on them and their innovation 4, 5 years ago.
And that has led to great success for Microsoft. That's led to great success for OpenAI. And we continue to build on it, right? So we serve them with world-class infrastructure on which they do their innovation in terms of models, on top of which we innovate on both the model layer with some of the post-training stuff we do as well as some of the small models we build and then, of course, all of the product innovation, right? One of the things that my own sort of conviction of OpenAI and what they were doing came about when I started seeing something like GitHub Copilot as a product get built or DAX Copilot get built or M365 Copilot get built. So we have a fantastic portfolio of innovation that we build on top of that.
And the same also, I would say, we are investors. We feel very, very good about sort of our investment stake in OpenAI. And so our focus -- and we're always in constant dialogue with them in a partnership like this where both sides have achieved mutual success at the pace at which we've achieved it. That means we need to kind of push each other to do more, to capture the moment, and that's what we plan to do, and we intend to keep building on it.
Amy E. Hood
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And maybe to your other two questions, Karl, listen, I'm thrilled with their success and need for supply from Azure and infrastructure and really what it's meant in terms of being able to also serve other customers for us. It's important that we continue to invest capital to meet not only their demand signal and needs for compute but also from our broader customers. That's partially why you've seen us committing the amount of capital we've seen over the past few quarters, is our commitment to both grow together and for us to continue to grow the Azure platform for customers beyond them. And so I don't really think of it as how do you balance it.
It's just we have customers who have needs and real use cases and delivering value today. And if we can't meet that, we need to work to meet it. And that means working harder and faster to make sure we do that, which is what the team is committed to do. Second piece of your question, I think, was on the impact to other income.
And not to get too accounting heavy on the earnings phone call, but I would say, just a reminder, this is under the equity method, which means we just take our percentage of losses every quarter. And those losses, of course, are capped by the amount of investment we make in total, which we did talk about in the Q this quarter as being $13 billion. And so over time, that's just the constraint, and it's a bit of a mechanical entry. And so I don't really think about managing that.
That's the investment and acceleration that OpenAI is making in themselves, and we take a percentage of that.

Hi. Thank you very much. Satya, when you talked about the investment cycle, these models are getting bigger, more expensive, but you also pointed out to how in the inference phase, we're likely to get paid. How does that cycle look like in inference for Microsoft? Where are the products and the applications that will show up on the Microsoft P&L as a result of the inference phase of AI kicking in?
Satya Nadella
--
Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kash. I mean the good news for us is that we're not waiting for that inference to show up, right? If you sort of think about the point we even made that this is going to be the fastest growth to $10 billion of any business in our history, it's all inference, right? One of the things that may not be as evident is that we're not actually selling raw GPUs for other people to train. In fact, that's sort of a business we turn away because we have so much demand on inference that we are not taking what I would -- in fact, there's a huge adverse selection problem today where people -- it's just a bunch of tech companies still using VC money to buy a bunch of GPUs. We kind of really are not even participating in most of that because we are literally going to the real demand, which is in the enterprise space or our own products like GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot.
So I feel the quality of our revenue is also pretty superior in that context. And that's what gives us even the conviction, to even Amy's answers previously, about our capital spend, is if this was just all about sort of a bunch of people training large models and that was all we got, then that would be ultimately still waiting, to your point, for someone to actually have demand, which is real. And in our case, the good news here is we have a diversified portfolio. We're seeing real demand across all of that portfolio.
Amy E. Hood
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And Kash, maybe just to add a little bit to what Satya is saying. I think a part of his 2 answers is that what you're seeing is this number we're talking about, the $10 billion, across inference and our apps is already what that momentum and that investment and that progress and that revenue is what builds the next cycle of training, right? And so it's that circle as opposed to, oh, we're doing training now and then inference. Much of the training investments that are -- that fuel this revenue growth came before, and we already funded that work. And so that's an important part.
Kash Rangan

That's, to your point, that you invest now, and you can get the growth later even if you slow down the capex, right? That's what you're trying to tell us.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy
--
Analyst
Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you can shed any more light just on the nature of the supply limitations that you're mentioning that are impacting Azure in Q2, where that impact might be incrementally just a touch more than we expected. Is it more the GPU supply? Is there some element of power cooling or the ability to wire up the networks? And Amy, should we infer that the supply is constraining Azure growth by roughly a couple of few points in Q2? Or am I overestimating that?
Amy E. Hood
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Maybe to answer both those questions, Mark, very directly, I wouldn't think about it component logic in my Q2 answer. The supply pushout, as Satya said, was third parties that are delivering later than we had expected, that get pushed mainly into the second half of the year and in general, Q3. So that's third parties where we have tended to buy supply inclusive of kits, so it's complete end-to-end third-party delivery. In terms of the impact, as I was saying, when you think about having flat consumption Q1 to Q2, there really are only 2 things that impact that difference, and 1 was the help we got in Q1 from the revenue and accounting help.
And then Q2 has been the supply pushout.

Raimo Lenschow

Analyst
Thank you. If you talk about the market at the moment -- because you were first with Copilot, you had identified a lot with copilots and now we're talking agents. Can you kind of -- Satya, how do you think about that? And to me, it looks like an evolution that we're discovering how to kind of productize AI better, et cetera. So how do you think about that journey between copilots, agents and maybe what's coming next?
Satya Nadella
--
Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. The system we have built is Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents, and autonomous agents. You should think of that as the spectrum of things, right? So ultimately, the way we think about how this all comes together is you need humans to be able to interface with AI. So the UI layer for AI is Copilot.
You can then use Copilot Studio to extend Copilot. For example, you want to connect it to your CRM system, to your office system, to your HR system. You do that through Copilot Studio by building agents effectively. You also build autonomous agents.
So you can use even -- that's the announcement we made a couple of weeks ago, is you can even use Copilot Studio to build autonomous agents. Now these autonomous agents are working independently, but from time to time, they need to raise an exception, right? So autonomous agents are not fully autonomous because, at some point, they need to either notify someone or have someone input something. And when they need to do that, they need a UI layer, and that's where, again, it's Copilot. So Copilot, Copilot agents built-in Copilot Studio, autonomous agents built in Copilot Studio, that's the full system, we think, that comes together, and we feel very, very good about the position.
And then, of course, we are taking the underlying system services across that entire stack that I just talked about, making it available in Azure, right? So you have the raw infrastructure if you wanted. You have the model layer independent of it. You have the AI app server in Azure AI, right? So everything is also a building block service in Azure for you to be able to build. In fact, if you want to build everything that we have built in the Copilot stack, you can build it yourself using the AI platform.
So that's sort of, in simple terms, our strategy, and that's kind of how it all comes together.

Rishi Jaluria

Analyst
Wonderful. Thanks. Hi, Satya. Hi, Amy.
Appreciate the question. I want to go and think a little bit about Copilot, how we should be thinking about kind of numbers here with the recategorization. It seems like that was maybe softer in the past than expected or maybe with the numbers this quarter starting to pick up. Can you maybe walk us through what you're seeing on that and maybe more importantly, how we should be thinking about your overall AI strategy on consumer versus enterprise, especially now with Moustafa on the fold?
Satya Nadella
--
Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. On the first part, Rishi, to your question, I think we feel very, very good about the momentum we have in the commercial Copilot, right? As I said in my remarks and Amy talked about, this is the fastest growth of a new suite in M365. If I compare it to what we saw even back -- way back in E3 or E5 or the transition from O to M, this is really much faster, right? It's the numbers of penetration of the Fortune 500 and then the fact that they're coming back for more seats and what have you. So it's very strong in that context.
The other thing I'd also mention is that we want this to be something that is systemic, right, because people need to be able to put the security controls. Then they need to deploy. Then there's skilling, and then there's change management. So this is not like you just -- it's not a tool.
Like when I talk about Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents, it's really as much about a new way to work. And sometimes I describe it as what happened throughout the '90s with PC penetration. After all, if you take a business process like forecasting, what was it like pre email and Excel and post email and Excel? That's the type of change that you see with Copilot. But overall, we feel great about the rate of progress and the penetration.
And then on the consumer side, look, for us, the exciting part here is to be able to use the same investment we are making in the commercial where we have structural strength and then beyond the offense. One of the things that, I think, I hope you all catch in our earnings is ex TAC. Our revenue, when it comes to what we describe as search, news, and ads, is growing faster than market. So that's -- it's fantastic to see that.
And so that's kind of our consumer business, which in Microsoft's large scope, it's sort -- even a $10-plus billion business sort of sometimes go missing. But in our case, it is actually a fantastic growth business that's growing faster than market. We feel good about how we will use AI in LinkedIn. In fact, LinkedIn is a consumer business as you know.
You saw even this week, they announced some new capabilities for both consumers and in their case, even recruiting. So we think that AI, the same investment gets monetized even through LinkedIn's innovation. And gaming, of course, is another place where you'll see some of these things apply and Windows, right? So the place where I think I'm excited about is Copilot+ PCs. For us, it's not about having a disconnected edge.
It's about having hybrid AI where the rebirth of sort of the PC as the edge of AI is going to be one of the most exciting things for developers. So we feel well positioned, quite frankly, with the same investment. So this is -- that's the thing. We're not a conglomerate here.
We are sort of one company. That means we invest once, and then we have all these categories that benefit from that. And that's the theory of the firm for us. And so we feel good about all of that coming together.
Amy E. Hood

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And maybe just to add one piece because I think, Rishi, now that I'm listening and thinking through the question, it feels like you're wondering, like why am I not seeing the Copilot, if you've made all this progress and the results, and the answer is you already are. In that M365 commercial number, we've seen that seat growth, but those seats that we're adding, the majority of them are driven by frontline worker and small businesses. Those have a lower ARPU point. And so it masks some of the ARPU that we're already seeing not just from E5, which continues to contribute, but also this quarter, additional impact from Copilot.
So as we go forward, being able -- that is where you're going to see the impact will be in ARPU in M365 commercial, and as Satya said, I think you'll see the impact of Copilot engagement, frankly, across the same ex TAC number.

Vice President, Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer; Amy Hood, chief financial officer; Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer; and Keith Dolliver, corporate secretary and deputy general counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call.
In this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second-quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted.
We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded.
If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Brett. This quarter, we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year over year. Enterprises are beginning to move from proof of concepts to enterprisewide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI. And our AI business has now surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, up 175% year over year.
Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our approach to how we manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws continue to compound across both pre-training and inference time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now. On inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations.
And as AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the commercial cloud, we are focused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training and inference as well as geo-distribution. From now on, it's a more continuous cycle governed by both revenue growth and capability growth thanks to the compounding effects of software-driven AI scaling laws and Moore's Law. With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack.
Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years, and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our data centers, networks, racks, and silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next-generation AI workloads.
We continue to take advantage of Moore's Law and refresh our fleet as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost, and HSM. When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloads encompassing nearly 400 billion records and two petabytes of data. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP, and VMware apps.
At the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric break out. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from Hitachi to Johnson Controls to Schaeffler. Fabric is now the fastest-growing analytics product in our history. Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% since last year.
Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or enterprise AI apps, you see the growth of raw storage, database services, and app platform services as these workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azure App Services more than doubled year over year, driving significant growth in adoption across SQL, hyperscale, and Cosmos DB. Now, on to AI platform and tools.
As we shared last week, we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure commitment. Through our strategic partnership, we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth. And with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure, customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models. And OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned.
Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling run times to build agents, multi-agent apps, AIOps, API access to thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users, and we are well positioned with our support of both OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of open-source models and SLMs. DeepSeek's R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and GitHub with automated red teaming, content safety integration, and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times.
And we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, PAYG AI, Rockwell Automation, Siemens to address industry-specific use cases. With AI, how we build, deploy, and maintain code is fundamentally changing, and GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify as well as world's largest enterprises like HP, HSBC, and KPMG. We have been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot and VS Code with more than 1 million sign-ups in just the first week post launch. All up, GitHub now is home to 150 million developers, up 50% over the past two years.
Now, on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow. We are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of existing enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats.
When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seat collectively by more than 10x over the past 18 months. To share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each quarter over the past year and now have 40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson, and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this quarter. And overall, the number of people who use Copilot daily, again, more than doubled quarter over quarter.
Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensity increased more than 60% quarter over quarter, and we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat, which was announced earlier this month. Copilot Chat, along with Copilot Studio, is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work. With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet.
More than 160,000 organizations have already used for Copilot Studio, and they collectively created more than 400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone, up over 2x quarter over quarter. We've also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings, manage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries, and access SharePoint data. And we also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot. What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI as well as our momentum with agents is our rich data cloud, which is the world's largest source of organizational knowledge.
Billions of emails, documents, and chats, hundreds of millions of Teams meetings, and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the enterprise knowledge cloud. It is growing fast, up over 25% year over year. More broadly, what we are seeing is Copilot plus agents disrupting business applications, and we are leaning into this.
With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo, RTX, TotalEnergies, and Vizient switched to our AI-powered apps from legacy providers. In healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician-patient encounters, up 54% quarter over quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase productivity of their physicians. When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for Windows 10.
Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities. 15% premium-priced laptops in the U.S. this holiday were Copilot+ PCs, and we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilots+ PCs. We also see more and more developers from Adobe and CapCut to WhatsApp build apps that leverage built-in NPUs.
And they will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distal models locally on Copilot+ PCs as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. And beyond Copilot+ PCs, the most powerful AI workstation for local development is a Windows PC running WSL2 powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Now, on to security. We continue to make progress with our Secure Future initiative, and we are applying what we have learned, introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year.
With Security Copilot organizations across private and public sector like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia Bank, NTT can resolve incidents 30% faster. Data governance is increasingly critical, and customers now use Microsoft purview to audit over 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use. Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high-value conversations on LinkedIn with comments up 37% year over year.
Short-form video continues to grow on the platform, with video creation all up growing at twice the rate of other post formats. We're also innovating with agents to help recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster, and our hiring business again took share. In subscriptions, LinkedIn premiums surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years, and nearly 40% of subscribers have used our AI features to improve their profiles.
And LinkedIn Marketing Solution remains the leader in B2B advertising. Now, on to search, advertising, and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge. Edge surpassed 30% market share in the U.S.
on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters. The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize ROI. And our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, first-of-its-kind features like Copilot Vision. Just today, we made Think Deeper, powered by o1, free for all Copilot users globally.
Now, on to gaming. We are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth driven by higher-margin content and platform services, and we are delivering on this plan. Black Ops 6 was top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in the franchise history. And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than 4 million people.
We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. All up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30% as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints. In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help our customers in this AI era, and I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $69.6 billion, up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.23, an increase of 10%.
We delivered another quarter of double-digit top- and bottom-line growth. Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage with higher-than-expected operating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI.
Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions with growth in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45%.
And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, more personal computing revenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased revenue more than expected in our commercial segments. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%.
Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations, and decreased two points year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year to 69%, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses as well as improvement in gaming and search, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, lower than expected, and operating margins increased two points year over year to 45%. The better-than-expected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across our businesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications.
At a total company level, head count at the end of December was 2% higher than a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.4 billion and grew 14% and 13% in constant currency, even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial.
Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings.
M365 commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by higher-than-expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows commercial on-premises components from the better-than-expected performance of M365 suites noted earlier. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to $86.3 million, with mix shift to M365 basic. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% with continued growth across all lines of business.
In our Talent Solutions business, results were slightly below expectations, driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key verticals. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency.
Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19% with more unfavorable FX impact than expected. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-prem server, and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better-than-expected results in Azure AI services. Azure other cloud services revenue grew 31%.
Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year over year, and was ahead of expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market execution challenges, particularly with our customers that we primarily reach through our scale motions as we balance driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations, driven by slower-than-expected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 1%, below expectations, with lower-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Industry Solutions.
Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased four points year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10% and operating income grew 14%. Now, to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year over year, with better-than-expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM prebuilds, usage from a third-party partnership in search as well as Call of Duty launch performance in gaming.
Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 4% year over year, ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 end support as well as uncertainty around tariffs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines.
Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased six points year over year, driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses as well as strong execution on margin improvement in gaming and search. Operating expenses decreased 1%.
Operating income increased 32% and 30% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization of higher-margin opportunities. Now, back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI-related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.
The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals, including our customer-contracted backlog. Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee, and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year over year, reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3 billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our Cruise investment.
Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis.
First, FX. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by two points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly one point in More Personal Computing.
When compared to our October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately two points and operating expense growth by approximately one point. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. Demand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth.
In commercial bookings, with a relatively flat expiry base and a strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be roughly flat year over year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%, down year over year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.
Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% in constant currency, or USD 29.4 billion to USD 29.7 billion. Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be between 14% and 15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better-than-expected Q2 results. We expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot, and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base.
For M365 commercial products, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year over year. As a reminder, M365 commercial products include Windows commercial on-premises components of M365 suites. So, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid- to high single digits, driven by M365 subscriptions.
For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in Talent Solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens driven by continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency, or USD 25.9 billion to USD 26.2 billion.
Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services, healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier.
And while we expect to be AI capacity-constrained in Q3, by the end of FY '25, we should be roughly in line with near-term demand given our significant capital investments. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-single digits, driven by a decrease in transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be USD 12.4 billion to USD 12.8 billion with continued prioritization of higher-margin opportunities.
Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year over year as our outlook assumes inventory levels will normalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue will decline.
Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-teens from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to moderate from last quarter, primarily due to additional FX impact and as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier returns to more normal levels. Search ex-TAC growth will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid- to high single digits. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits.
We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits driven by first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Hardware revenue will decline year over year. Now, back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between USD 21.65 billion to USD 21.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant currency or to be between USD 16.4 billion and USD 16.5 billion.
Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion, primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond.
First, FX. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth by roughly one point. Next, capital expenditures.
We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY '26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals, including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud. However, the growth rate will be lower than FY '25 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets, which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud, including AI workloads.
As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. And given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI solutions, we now expect FY '25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year. And finally, our FY '25 full-year effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19%.
In closing, we are committed to delivering real-world AI solutions to help customers grow and improve their results. We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our customers. Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Brett Iversen is moving to a new role here as the Head of our Americas sales finance team.

Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And echoing Amy's comments, Brett, congratulations on the new role. It's been a pleasure working with you, and best of luck in that new role.
Looking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings. But again, we were a little bit disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what the resolution to those issues were. And do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter? Thank you very much.
Amy E. Hood

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Keith. Let me spend a little time on that about what we saw in Q2 and give you some additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about. First, let me be very specific, they are in the non-AI ACR component. Our Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by the operating teams pulling in some delivery dates even by weeks.
When you're capacity-constrained, weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and you see that in the revenue results. On the non-AI side, really, the challenges were in what we call the scale motions. So, think about primarily, these are customers we reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the art form there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took our sales motions in the summer and really changed to try to balance those two.
As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars, and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. And I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts on whether you have that balance right. And so, the teams are working through that. They're already making adjustments.
And I expect while we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through the scale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust. I feel good that the teams understand and are working through that. So, hopefully, that's just helpful on that. Then we talked a little bit about Q3.
And so, we've talked about 31 to 32 after publishing a 31 this quarter. Our AI results that we had felt good about and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. So, again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place, and that's no different than it was our expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all. And when I talk about being capacity-constrained, it takes two things.
You have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right? That's the infrastructure and the land and then you have to have kits. We're continuing, and you've seen that's why our spend has pivoted this way, to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short power and space. And so, as you see those investments land that we've made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year.
And so, the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize, and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that's changed is really that scale motion from my seat, Keith. I hope that's helpful.
Satya?
Satya Nadella

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, AI growth rate is actually better than what we expected, and we worked through some of the supply stuff and more importantly, some of the workloads are scaling well. And when you look underneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is the ratio of even what we would call just regular storage, data services, app services. So, underneath a ChatGPT or a Copilot or even the emerging AI workloads in the enterprise, so that's all good.
The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, that's also in good shape. And it's just the scale place where Amy talked about this nuance, right, how do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market? At a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation. And that's the art form Amy was referencing to, to make sure you get the right balance. But let me put it this way.
You would rather win the new than just protect the past. And that's sort of another thing that we definitely will lean into always.

Analyst
Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you give more color on what drove the far larger-than-expected Microsoft AI revenue? We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it. But can you give more color on that? And our estimates are that the Copilot was much bigger than we had expected and growing much faster. Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI beat would be great.
Thanks.
Amy E. Hood
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mark, for the question. Yes, that was, as we talked about, better than expected. A couple of pieces to that, which you correctly identified, number one is the Azure component we just talked about. And the second piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better.
And what was important about that, we saw strength both in seats, both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about. And usage doesn't directly impact revenue, but of course, indirectly does as people get more and more value added. And also, price per seat was actually quite good. We still have a good signal for value.
So, those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that sort of outperformance in terms of our expectations.

Brent Thill

Analyst
Thanks. Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek a couple of times in your prepared remarks. I think everyone would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And are we seeing AI scale now at a lower cost? Are we reaching a mark where you can see that? Or do we still have some time to go? Thanks for your thoughts on this.
Satya Nadella
--
Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Brent. So, yeah, in my remarks, I talked about, in some sense, what's happening with AI. It's no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle.
It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. So, there's Moore's Law that's working and hyperdrive. Then on top of that, there is the AI scaling laws, both the pretraining and the inference time compute that compound, and that's all software. You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we have observed for a while, which is 10x on improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference.
And so, that's what you see. And add to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in '01. And so, we are going to -- obviously, now that all gets commoditized and it's going to get broadly used.
And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right? Because at the end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client server to cloud? More people bought servers, except it was called cloud. And so, when token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written. And it's interesting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of '25, where on the PC, you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure. So, that type of optimization means AI will be much more ubiquitous.
And so, therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I'm concerned.

Analyst
Thank you. Maybe this one is well for Satya, and it's also away from the numbers. But Satya, I wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success, but electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training capex needs.
I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate, and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about capex needs over the next several years? Thank you.
Satya Nadella
--
Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, we remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI. And as you saw, they have committed in a big way to Azure, and even in the bookings, what we recognized is just the first tranche of it.
And so, you'll see given the ROFR we have more benefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their success is our success because even all the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with that announcement. But to your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right? We are making sure that there's the right balance between training and inference. It's geo-distributed.
We are working super hard on all the software optimizations, right? I mean, just not the software optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models over the years in partnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it, and that's been key to driving, right? One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model -- but if it's too expensive to serve, it's no good, right? It does -- it won't generate any demand. So, you've got to have that optimization so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly. And so, that's the fleet physics we are managing.
And also, remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x, your optimization is going to give you 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of as the training expense. So, I feel very good about the investment we are making, and it's fungible, and it just allows us to scale more long-term business.
Amy E. Hood
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on capex because I think it's helpful to ground a bit more in what Satya is saying, a fungible fleet means. We have, and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO. That is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on. And the faster we can do that and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are, not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers.
And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference. But there is some training post training, which is a key component. And then they're just running the commercial cloud, which at every layer under every modern AI app that's going to be built will be required. It will be required to be distributed, and it will be required to be global.
And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient. And so, the investment you see us make in capex, you're right, the front end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets us really catch up not just on the AI infrastructure we needed, but think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do on the commercial cloud side. And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU. And that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue, and it will be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others.
And so, I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the capex growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is.

Thank you very much for taking my question. And I'll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as well. Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer requirements out there? Thanks.

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thanks, Brad, for the question. In fact, you saw us make two announcements recently. One is on the M365 Copilot side, we now have the Copilot chat. So, this is now going to be broadly deployed across the entire installed base effectively because you can go have this now turned on by IT and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right away, and it has Copilot Studio built in.
And so, that means they can start building agents. So, we think of that plus the full Copilot as a good combination that I think will accelerate, quite frankly, in terms of just seat usage and agent building and what have you. So, that's sort of one. And the other thing is you also see, even on the consumer side, we just, yesterday, launched one -- or the ThinkHarder feature on Copilot now that's powered by o1.
It's available globally, right? So, you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost coming down means you can drive more ubiquity of what were features that ones were sort of premium tier, and that's all definitely something that we will do across, right? The same thing is happening in GitHub Copilot, same thing in security Copilot. So, across the length and breadth of our portfolio, you'll see that.

That's great. Thank you very much. Satya, if you look out several years, any sense of what percent of inference done on Azure will be done on proprietary models versus open models? And with that said, does it matter to Microsoft at the end of the day? Thanks.
Satya Nadella

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. It's a good question because at some level, what you're seeing is effectively lots of models that get used in any application, right? When you look underneath even a Copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what have you, you already see lots of many different models. You build models, you fine-tune models, you distill models. Some of them are models that you distill into an open-source model.
So, there's going to be a combination. So, we've always maintained that it's always good to have frontier models. You want to always build your application with high ambition using the best. model that is available and then optimize from there on.
So, that's also another side. Like there's a temporality to it, right? What you start with as a given COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency and COGS and putting in different models. And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So, one of the things that we are investing heavily on is foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with this flurry of models that are coming in, and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to benefit from all that innovation, but not have all the dev cost or the DevOps cost or what people talk about AIOps cost.
So, we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to benefit from all these different models, open source, close source, different weight classes, and at the same time, from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you.

Wonderful. Thank you so much. Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength.
Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof of concept to departmental deals, maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise? And you mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that confidence that that will ramp into monetization later. Thank you.
Satya Nadella

Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in immediate productivity, a sales team, in finance, or in supply chain where there is a lot of, like, for example, SharePoint grounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web data and have it produce results that are beneficial. But then what's happening very much like what we have seen in these previous generation productivity things is that people collaborate across functions, across roles, right? For example, even in my own daily habit, I go to chat. I use work tab and get results, and then I immediately share using pages with colleagues.
I sort of call it think with AI and work with people. And that pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard issue across the enterprise. And so, that's what we're seeing. It starts maybe at a departmental level.
Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across. You can do it by cohort and what have you. And so, what we've made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat plus this. And so, that gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have something that's more ubiquitous.

Thank you for taking the question here. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to commercial bookings. Commercial RPO, I think, increased $39 billion sequentially.
That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis, commercial bookings growth, 75% constant currency. That's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade. I appreciate there's some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter, there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful.
Thanks.
Amy E. Hood

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Brent. It's a great question. We talked a little bit about one of the main drivers, which was one of the Azure commitments that OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, while that is obviously a big component, you'll continue to see OpenAI make commitments.
So, I don't -- I want to separate the concept that it's one-time versus an ongoing relationship that will grow as they grow, which it absolutely will. And to your question on what else is participating in that number. First, we did have very good core motions. Our core motions are things like, to your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-ons to those contracts, upsells, like, for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes.
And I think that's important. We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about Suite momentum, and we saw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about. And then the final component is large Azure commitments. And those really did look as we expected, which is good.
To your point, and that you're seeing a really broad-based growth. Those Azure commitments take two forms. One, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are making larger commitments, which is a good commitment signed for the platform. And then you have new customers making commitments, and we also saw that this quarter.
And so, to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think it's just one thing. I think you're right. Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently across the workloads.

Satya Nadella:
Thank you, Jonathan. It was a very strong close to what was a record fiscal year for us. All up, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $168 billion in annual revenue, up 23%. The rate of innovation and the speed of diffusion is unlike anything we have seen. To that end, we are building the most comprehensive suite of AI products and tech stack at massive scale. And to provide more context, I want to walk up the stack starting with Azure. Azure surpassed $75 billion in annual revenue, up 34% driven by growth across all workloads. We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave and took share every quarter this year.
We opened new data centers across six continents and now have over 400 data centers across 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. There is a lot of talk in the industry about building the first gigawatt and multi-gigawatt data centers. We stood up more than two gigawatts of new capacity over the past twelve months alone, and we continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor. Every Azure region is now AI-first. All of our regions can now support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet.
And we are driving and riding a set of compounding S-curves across silicon systems and models to continuously improve efficiency and performance for our customers. Take, for example, the GBD 4.0 family of models, which have the highest volume of inference tokens. Through software optimization alone, we are delivering 90% more tokens for the same GPU compared to a year ago. Beyond the AI fleet, we continue to build our commercial cloud to address customers' unique data residency and sovereignty requirements. This quarter, we introduced the Microsoft Sovereign Cloud, the industry's most comprehensive solution spanning both public and private cloud deployments. All of this innovation is driving our strong results. We saw accelerating growth from migrations again this quarter.
Nestle, for example, migrated more than 200 SAP instances, 10,000 plus servers, and 1.2 petabytes of data to Azure with near-zero business disruption. That makes it one of the largest and most successful migrations in business history. The next big accelerator in the cloud will be quantum, and I'm excited about progress. In fact, earlier this month, we announced the world's first operational deployment of a level two quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing. This is how we will continue to think and make investments with decade-long arcs while making progress every quarter. The next layer is data, which is foundational to every AI application.
Microsoft Fabric is becoming the complete data and analytics platform for the AI era, spanning everything from SQL to NoSQL to analytics workloads. It continues to gain momentum with revenue up 55% year over year, and over 25,000 customers. It's the fastest-growing database product in our history. FabricOne expands all databases and clouds, including semantic models from Power BI, and, therefore, it is the best source of knowledge and grounding for AI applications and context engineering. Azure Databricks and Snowflake on Azure both accelerated as well. Cosmos DB and Azure PostgreSQL are both powering mission-critical workloads at scale. OpenAI, for example, uses Cosmos DB in the hot path of every chat GPT, storing chat history, user profiles, and conversational state.
And Azure PostgreSQL stores metadata critical to the operation of chat GPT as well as OpenAI's developer APIs. This year, we launched Azure AI Foundry to help customers design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents at scale. Foundry features best-in-class tooling, management, observability, and built-in controls for trustworthy AI. Customers increasingly want to use multiple AI models to meet their specific performance, cost, and use case requirements. And with Foundry, they can provision inferencing throughput once and apply it across more models than any other hyperscaler, including models from OpenAI, DeepSea, Meta, x AI's Grok, and very soon, Black Forest Labs and Mistral AI.
We sim-shipped 15 models from OpenAI alone on Foundry this year, providing same-day access to state-of-the-art models deeply integrated with our infrastructure and tools. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of our new Foundry agent service, which is now being used by 14,000 customers to build agents that automate complex tasks. For example, Nasdaq is using Foundry to build agents that help customers prepare for board meetings, cutting prep time by up to 25%. All up, 80% of Fortune 500 already use Foundry, and when we look narrowly at just the number of tokens served by Foundry API, we processed over 500 trillion this year, up over seven times.
This is a good indicator of true platform diffusion beyond a few head apps and services. Talking about the app layer, these applications are becoming embedded in our daily work and life. Our family of Copilot apps has surpassed 100 million monthly active users across commercial and consumer. And when you take a broader look at the engagement of AI features across our products, we have over 800 million monthly active users. Microsoft 365 Copilot is becoming the new way to organize, work, and workflow and work artifacts. We rolled out our biggest update to Microsoft 365 Copilot to date this quarter, bringing together chat, search, create notebooks, as well as agents into one intuitive scaffolding.
With this innovation and continued product improvements, we are seeing real momentum. Customers continue to adopt Copilot at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite with strong usage intensity as shown by our week-over-week retention. And we saw the largest quarter of seat ads since launch with a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. Barclays, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 100,000 employees globally following a successful initial deployment to 15,000. UBS is expanding its deployment to all of its employees after initially rolling it out to 55,000 of them. And Adobe, KPMG, Pfizer, Wells Fargo, all purchased over 25,000 seats this quarter.
Tens of thousands of organizations have already used our researcher and analyst deep reasoning agents in the first weeks of availability, and we have introduced group-level agents in teams like facilitator and interpreter, which generate real-time translation and notes in meetings. Hundreds of partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday have built their own third-party agents that integrate with Copilot and Teams. We are also seeing more customers use Copilot Studio to Microsoft 365 Copilot and build their own agents. This year, customers created 3 million agents using SharePoint and Copilot Studio. And with Copilot tuning, they can easily create agents fine-tuned on their company's data workflow and style that reflect their unique tone, language, and expertise.
We're also seeing great traction among specific roles and functions starting with developers. GitHub Copilot continues to have great momentum in IDE with agent mode and new form factors like coding agent, which is capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. We have 20 million GitHub Copilot users. GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers increased 75% quarter over quarter. As companies tailor Copilot to their own code bases. And 90% of the Fortune 100 now use GitHub Copilot. More broadly, GitHub usage and repos are seeing explosive growth because of AI. AI projects on GitHub more than doubled over the last year.
The surge in wide coding projects and AI coding agents, whether it is ClaudeCode, Codex, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot, are generating more pull requests and more repos on GitHub. And our code review agent is being used heavily across the platform performing millions of code reviews each month. In health care, we had a breakout year for Dragon Copilot. Customers used our ambient AI solutions to document over 13 million physician-patient encounters this quarter, up nearly seven times year over year. For example, at Mercy Health System, more than a thousand physicians are already using Copilot to reduce administrative burden so that they can focus on providing better care.
They have saved more than 100,000 hours to date and plan to expand to all 5,000 providers. As one physician put it, the best thing to happen to my practice in ten years. And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks. More broadly, AI is driving a fundamental change in the biz app market as customers shift from legacy systems to agentic business applications. Dynamics 365 took share this year. And we are winning customers in every industry, like Verizon with sales, Domino's Pizza Group with ERP, 1-800-Flowers with contact center. When it comes to consumer apps, we are innovating across all surfaces.
In fact, on Monday, we introduced Copilot mode in Edge. It's especially exciting to see the innovation coming back to browsers. Copilot mode brings together Copilot composer, chat, discover, search, and actions to build the next generation of browser for the AI age. Copilot consumer app also continues to see strong growth in engagement and successful sessions. And we are bringing Copilot to every Windows 11 PC. With Copilot Vision, you can share your screen with Copilot and get real-time insights and assistance on anything. And we are well-positioned as we approach Windows 10 end of support in October, thanks to Windows 11 and Copilot plus PCs, which offer customers compelling security as well as AI value.
Talking about security, it underlies our cloud and AI infrastructure as well as our Copilot and agents. We have launched over 100 new capabilities over the past year. Just last week, we added a modern data lake to our SIM, Microsoft Sentinel, bringing together customer data across our first-party tools, as well as third-party ecosystem over 350 connectors. We're also extending the system's customers already use for governance, identity, security, and management to protect every AI agent. Entra now extends identity permissions policies and controls to agents, Defender secures nearly 2 million general AI apps. Purview is used by three-quarters of the Microsoft 365 Copilot customers to protect their data.
And all up, we now have nearly 1.5 million security customers and continue to take share across all major categories we serve. Before I wrap, I want to talk about two consumer businesses of ours with massive end-user reach, LinkedIn and Xbox. LinkedIn is home to 1.2 billion members with four consecutive years of double-digit member growth. All up, comments on LinkedIn rose over 30%, and video uploads increased over 20% this year. We continue to bring AI to every part of LinkedIn experience, introducing agents across hiring as well as 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices.
We are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter with successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger. 50 million people have played Black Ops 6. Total hours surpassed 2 billion. Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development. So much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay streamed via the cloud this year and Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.
In closing, we are going through a generational tech shift with AI, and I have never been more confident in my opportunity to drive long-term growth and define what the future looks like. With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results as well as the outlook.
Amy Hood:
Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This year, we delivered over $281 billion in revenue, up 15% year over year, which reflects the broad strength of our products and services. Operating income was over $128 billion, up 17% year over year as we invested against the expansive opportunity ahead. And in our largest quarter of the year, we significantly exceeded expectations with strong execution by our sales and partner teams. As Satya shared, innovating faster than ever to deliver new value to our customers. This quarter, revenue was $76.4 billion, up 18% in constant currency.
Gross margin dollars increased 15% in constant currency, while operating income increased 22% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $3.65, an increase of 22% in constant currency. For the first time, commercial bookings were over $100 billion, increasing 30% in constant currency, on a strong prior year comparable. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions including healthy renewals, as well as an increase in the number of $10 million and $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 helped drive these results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $368 billion, up 35% in constant currency. Roughly 35% will be recognized in revenue in the next twelve months, up 21% year over year.
The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next twelve months, increased 49%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue. Segment level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, ahead of expectations and grew 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, down two points year over year from the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in Azure and Microsoft 365 commercial cloud.
Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down one point year over year, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, and the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 5% in constant currency, and operating margins increased two points year over year, to 45%. Better than expected revenue growth, coupled with a focus on operating efficiently, drove the margin expansion. At a total company level, headcount at the June was relatively unchanged, year over year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33.1 billion and grew 14% in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Microsoft 365 products and cloud services and Microsoft 365 consumer products and cloud services.
Microsoft 365 commercial cloud revenue was ahead of expectations, and increased 16% in constant currency with two points of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Business trends remained relatively stable to the prior quarter when excluding the in-period revenue recognition. With ARPU growth again driven by E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Paid Microsoft 365 commercial seats grew 6% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Though primarily in our small and medium business, and frontline worker offerings. Microsoft 365 commercial products revenue increased 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations to higher than expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing.
Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue was better than expected, increasing 20% driven by ARPU growth following the January price increase and subscriber growth of 8%. LinkedIn revenue increased 8% in constant currency, with growth across all businesses. Though Talent Solutions continues to be impacted, by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 21% in constant currency with strong execution in our core annuity sales motions, leading to growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Driven by the efficiency gains noted earlier, even as we deliver more AI features across our products and scale our AI infrastructure.
Operating expenses increased 6% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% in constant currency. Next, the intelligent cloud segment. Revenue was $29.9 billion and grew 25% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by Azure, and our on-premises server business. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 39%. Significantly ahead of expectations driven by accelerated growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. As a reminder, new cloud and AI workloads are built and scaled. Using the breadth of our services. Revenue from Azure AI services was generally in line with expectations. And while we brought additional data center capacity online this quarter, demand remains higher than supply.
In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by transactional purchasing which also has higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 6% in constant currency, with growth in enterprise support services, partially offset a decline in industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased four points year over year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by Azure efficiency gains noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 4% in constant currency, and operating income grew 23%. Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $13.5 billion and grew 9%. Exceeding expectations primarily due to Windows OEM as well as Xbox content and services.
Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 3% year over year, ahead of expectations as inventory levels remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 20% in constant currency, driven by continued growth both volume and revenue per search. As well as roughly eight points of favorable impact from third-party partnerships including the benefit of a low prior year comparable. And in gaming, revenue increased 10%. Xbox content and services revenue increased 12% in constant currency, driven by better than expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%. Gross margin percentage increased three points year over year with improvement across all businesses. Operating expenses increased 3% in constant currency.
Operating income increased 33% in constant currency, driven by continued prioritization, of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures were $24.2 billion including $5 billion of finance leases, where we recognize the full value at the time of lease commencement. Cash paid for PP&E was $17.1 billion. The difference is primarily due to finance leases. More than half our spend was on long-lived assets, will support monetization over the next fifteen years and beyond. The remaining spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, and driven by strong demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $42.6 billion up 15%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments.
And this quarter, free cash flow was $25.6 billion. Other income and expense was negative $1.7 billion primarily due to losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate, approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $37 billion for the full fiscal year. Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a US dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY '26. First, FX.
Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase full year revenue growth and COGS growth by approximately two points and to increase operating expense growth by one point. Next, building on the strong momentum we saw this past year, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY '26. We will continue to invest against the expansive opportunity ahead across both capital expenditures and operating expenses, given our leadership position in commercial cloud, strong demand signals for our cloud and AI offerings, and significant contracted backlog. Capital expenditure growth, as we shared last quarter, will moderate compared to FY '25 with a greater mix of short-lived assets.
Due to the timing of delivery of additional capacity in H1, including large finance lease sites, we expect growth rates in H1 will be higher than in H2. We remain focused on delivering revenue growth increasing our operational agility. And as a result, we expect operating margins to be relatively unchanged year over year. And finally, expect our FY '26 effective tax rate to be between 19-20%. Now to our outlook for the first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by roughly three points in productivity and business processes and roughly one point in intelligence cloud and more personal computing.
We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth, by roughly one point. In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth on a growing X3 base. Bookings growth will again be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year over year driven by the impact of continuing to scale our AI infrastructure. We expect Q1 capital expenditures to be over $30 billion driven by the continued strong demand signals we see.
As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs, and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue of $32.2 to $32.5 billion or growth of 14% to 15% with roughly three points of benefit from FX as noted earlier. In Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft 365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid to high single digits.
As a reminder, Microsoft 365 commercial products includes both the Windows commercial on-premises components of Microsoft 365 suites, and office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in-period revenue recognition dynamics. Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the low twenties driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For intelligent cloud, we expect revenue of $30.1 to $30.4 billion or growth of 25% to 26%, with roughly one point of benefit from FX as noted earlier.
Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which can have quarterly variability in year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery, and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services on a significant base. Even as we continue bringing more data center capacity online, we currently expect to remain capacity constrained, through the first half of our fiscal year. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid single digits, with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings.
In more personal computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 to $12.9 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits. We expect the elevated inventory levels at the end of Q4 to come down through the quarter in Windows OEM, although the range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid teens, down sequentially as growth rates normalize, following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume, and revenue per search across Edge and Bing. Overall search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the low double digits.
And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits against a strong prior year comparable. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $24.3 to $24.5 billion or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of $15.7 to $15.8 billion or growth of 5% to 6%. Other income and expense is estimated to be negative $1.3 billion primarily due to investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be between 19-20%.
In closing, we finished the year with double-digit revenue and operating income growth. And exceeded the FY '25 operating margin commitment we shared a year ago. Our focus remains on investing in security, quality, an AI platform and product innovation that delivers value and opportunity to our customers. We are excited for FY '26. With that, let's go to Q and A, Jonathan.
Jonathan Neilson:
Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q and A. Out of respect for those on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator:
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. And the confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss:
Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic end to FY 2025. I've been covering Microsoft Corporation for a while. I don't think I've ever seen a quarter where, like, everything came together this well. So congratulations on that.
Satya Nadella:
Thank you for calling Income Conferencing. The next available operator will be with you momentarily. On. So these are workload results that are invaluable for us to learn to build both the products as well as the platform. And then broadly they or rather over time, they will be brought to few. In fact, one of the things that Amy and I track is not just the head app usage, but also what's the sort of all the tier two applications that are being built. That's sort of that's speaks a little bit, Keith, to, I think, your question.
Is as long as we have head apps shaping the platform, and then after that, we have the broad diffusion happen, which in some sense with both of those is what we're seeing. So I feel very good about being in decent standing going forward.
Jonathan Neilson:
Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.
Operator:
The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler:
Thank you. I also give you my congratulations. Amazing I didn't know how you were gonna beat last quarter. And you did it. So congratulations. And thank you for taking my question. Satya and Amy, we're now two plus years since the Jaina revolution. Adoption is still early and ramping. What do you think is the best way that software companies are gonna be able to monetize AI for SaaS? Do you believe there are differences in monetization for horizontal, more general apps like Microsoft 365 Copilot or dynamic CRM Copilot versus very targeted capacities on the AgenTex side? And, also, how should you think about the trajectory of SaaS AI margins over the long term? Thank you.
Satya Nadella:
Yeah. Start, and Amy, you should feel free to add. I mean, if I just broaden out beyond just SaaS as a category, I think just like, you know, the server to cloud transition, was an expansion of essentially usage of servers. That is essentially what happened with the cloud, right, which is we did a bunch of servers except that the expertise required, the capital required, the time required to bring up servers, build it out, scale it, was just all hard. And so therefore, the market was a certain size, whereas with the cloud, you could sort of buy it with flexibility, you could burst, and you could spin up and spin down. The expertise required came down.
So it was just orders of magnitude. That's what happening. So if you sort of even subscribe to this point of view that intelligence is basically log of compute, that means compute's going to grow and you've got to use it as efficiently as possible to just keep creating, intelligence. Now how does it manifest beyond just the infrastructure? I kind of to Keith's earlier question, talked a little bit about how infrastructure is getting shaped, data layer is getting shaped, the app server is getting built. These are all classic categories of infrastructure. That'll continue, but they will be an order or two of magnitude more.
So literally, like, there in fact, one of the other things we track is every GPU requires storage and compute, that ratio. Is another thing that is really exponential for AI infrastructure. Growth. So when you go to the app layer, the SaaS apps themselves are now building in if effectively agentic and chat interfaces with intelligence. And they're also building autonomous agents. Agents are kind of like applications, like a database application. Perhaps, but they are being used increasingly in app you know, inside of a user interaction. I think a good example is GitHub Copilot. It got started as an you know, code completions on an IDE. Then we added the chat interface to it.
Then we added the agent mode to it. And now we have an autonomous agent, which in fact works completely asynchronous. Right? So all those four things are now part of essentially GitHub. And by the way, it also turns out that every other tool that is also doing any form of coding is adding more and more GitHub reports. If I had to think about GitHub monetization, we have an opportunity around just monetizing GitHub Enterprise. And then we have the ability to think about GitHub Copilot. And GitHub Copilot, as with all these form factors. And so that's exactly the same thing that's with Microsoft 365. That's the same thing that's happening with Dynamics 365.
So you have to be very open to taking your data tier, your business logic tier, and your UI tier and sort of being more expansive in it. As long as you do that, it's just that usage goes up. And that's what I think shows up in the results.
Amy Hood:
And I think, Mark, if you wanted to think about all the things in the layers that you talked about is really we're seeing very similar monetization tools exist in this transition too. Right? There's a per user logic. There's tiers of per user. Sometimes those tiers relate to consumption. Sometimes there's pure consumption models. Think you'll continue to see a blending of these, especially as the AI model capability grows. You'll end up with ways that teams are gonna wanna throttle that usage, use the best models for the best job, and I think the blending of these models will continue to be something we see on the go forward basis.
Mark Moerdler:
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Jonathan Neilson:
Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.
Operator:
The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead:
Okay. Satya, Amy, this is the second quarter in a row of pretty material Azure upside from what sounds like an acceleration in, on-prem to Azure migration activity. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the plethora of customer conversations you've had, whether there are a couple of two or three specific catalysts that are driving that migration? And how durable a trend do you think that is? Thank you.
Satya Nadella:
Yeah. I'm just the three things are really one is the migrations. A good example would be what I referenced in my remarks with Nestle, with the SAP instances, they moved along with a lot of the data that's associated with it and a bunch of servers. So that's kind of a classic example. Think whether it's VMware migrations or migrations of SAP or even just our own server migrations, they're pretty healthy. And as it turns out that we're still not anywhere close to the finish line, if at best, maybe in the middle innings of that. The second thing that's also happening is cloud-native applications that are scaling. This is even excluding all of the AI stuff.
Just the classic cloud-native e-commerce company, let's say, these are scaling in a big way. And some of those customers were not on Azure previously, but now they're increasingly there. If they have come for AI perhaps, but they now stay for more than AI. And so to me, that's another thing you see in overall what's happening across the Azure number. And then, of course, there are the new AI workflows. So those are three things that are all, in some sense, building on each other, but that's kinda what's driving our growth.
Karl Keirstead:
Got it. Thank you.
Jonathan Neilson:
Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.
Operator:
The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill:
Satya, back to the strength across the board in the quarter. Was there anything that jumped out at you or surprised you that you didn't think you were going to see but you did see in the quarter? It just the magnitude of upside, I think, had shocked many here.
Satya Nadella:
Yeah. I don't know, Brent, if anything really surprised us. But I think what we are noticing in our own build-out of these AI and in general is the platform is becoming more than here's a model, and here's an API, make some calls. I mean, that's in some sense was a bit of the state of the art maybe even a year ago. Whereas now you have essentially these very stateful app patterns that are emerging that require quite a bit of rethinking of even the app stack. I mean, take even the storage tier stuff. Right?
The degree of sophistication you have and hey, how much of an index do you really want to build by pre-processing so that your prompt engineering or context engineering, as I called, can be better and higher quality. So I think all of that is emerging. So when I look at a product like Azure Search, Fabric, and Cosmos DB, all of the things, the framework around it are just becoming robust to build serious applications. And so that's what I feel great about is the learning curve inside the company, outside the company, the diffusion of the stack. The speed with which that's emerging that you can build applications is much faster.
I always go back and say, hey, when a I don't know. A relational database came out, it took a while for people to build an ERP system, let's say. And this thing we're kind of building pretty sophisticated applications at a very, very fast clip based on, I think, the degree of maturity that's emerging.
Brent Thill:
Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.
Operator:
The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow:
Perfect. Thank you. Congrats from me as well. I had one question around Copilot, and I'm obviously a happy user here at Barclays. If you think about it the one thing that we're all realizing is that Copilot is the AI part, but data is becoming more and more important. And then from there on, we can start thinking about agents. Where is the where what are you seeing in your customer conversations, Satya, about, like, that understanding that Copilot is actually just the starting point, and then from there on, you know, it's really becoming, like, much, much broader. Thank you.
Satya Nadella:
Yeah. I think that's right. Even inside of Copilot, I'm sure you're seeing it. Right? You now have analyst and researcher to just talk about two examples. And, of course, people, all the third-party agents. So, yeah, there is a lot more of just not request response. It's about spawning essentially applications that then go to work and come back. But the UI still remains very important, right, even for asynchronous work, to instruct the asynchronous work, you need UI. And to monitor asynchronous work, you need UI. It may be it may not be a chat interface. And of course, you need a way to then inspect what the asynchronous work is.
So even take the example I was giving on GitHub, even if you're not using GitHub Copilot to create the code check-in or the pull request, interestingly enough, we're seeing massive to get a Copilot code review agent even if you used maybe CloudClub, you know, CloudClub or whatever else to write the code. So that's I think what's happening across all of these. So you're absolutely right that you need it starts with some kind of a UI that's more chat-focused, but it quickly goes beyond it. And you see it in Microsoft 365, you see it in Dynamics 365, and you see it in GitHub.
Raimo Lenschow:
Thank you.
Jonathan Neilson:
Thanks, Raimo. Operator, next question, please.
Operator:
The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Kash Rangan:
Hi. Thank you very much, Amy. I wanna acknowledge that, I think a few quarters ago, you said that you reached a point in time where you can accelerate Azure while slowing down CapEx. So you did it. But what is the outlook? When I look at the CapEx guidance for the upcoming quarter, certainly, I would view that as a positive indicator of the book of business you have for your cloud services. But how should we think about the shape of the curve of, CapEx vis a vis Azure growth rate in the years ahead, particularly as I listen to Satya's comments, on, the AI stack consuming more and more infrastructure.
Are we at a point where we're gonna have to continue to do this and we magically wait for inference and applications to kick in and they've therefore create a richer gross margin mix. Thank you so much for your comments, and congrats on the quarter.
Amy Hood:
Thanks, Kash. Let me back up and first say when you think about the full year comments I've made on CapEx, as well as the Q1 guidance of over $30 billion you first have to ground yourself in the fact that we have $368 billion of contracted backlog we need to deliver, not just across Azure, but, of across the breadth of the Microsoft Cloud. So in terms of feeling good, about the ROI and the growth rates and the correlation I feel very good that the spend that we're making is correlated to basically contracted on the books business.
That we need to deliver and we need the teams to execute at their very best to get the capacity in place. As quickly and effectively as they can. And so when you look we've talked about the growth rate will decline year over year. But at its core, our investments, particularly in short-lived assets, like servers, GPUs, CPUs, networking storage, is just really correlated to the backlog we see and the curve of demand. And I talked about my gosh, in January and said, I thought we'd be in better supply demand shape by June. And now I'm saying, hope I'm in better shape by December. And that's not because we slowed CapEx.
Even with accelerating the spend and trying to pull leases in and get CPUs and GPUs in the system as quickly as we can we are still seeing demand improve. And so I am not as focused, Cash, on trying to pick a date at which revenue growth and CapEx growth will meet and cross. I'm focused on building backlog, building business, and delivering capacity. Which we are seeing has a good ROI today. In terms of our ability to get that done. So I don't want people to get overly focused on a pivot point because when you're in sort of these expansive moments, picking a data point usually means you're gonna pick to be too conservative.
In terms of market share gain and in terms of winning. And so I tend to put my energy more there.
Satya Nadella:
Yeah. I think one of the other things Kash is that I think I said this in the previous earnings as well, which is the difference between a holster and a high scaler is software. And the same is going to be true here. That GPD 4.0 example I gave, is all software, right? The optimization even in the last year. So we know how to use the software skills to take any piece of hardware and make it, you know, multiple x better. And so that's kind of where the yield will come. But as Amy said, while you're really going and building out the plant, you don't wanna sort of serialize it.
You just want to go in parallel on all of these fronts. And that's sort of what will compound over time. And I do think it's important when Platts talks about the software layer, he's talking about in his comments to connect this back to the compounding S-curves. And so I would remind people that is something that we saw through the prior cloud transition. It's how we operated through that one and the same sort of skills and logic done at an even faster pace. Is what will apply the same transition.
Kash Rangan:
Sounds very encouraging. Thank you so much.
Jonathan Neilson:
Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.
Operator:
The next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Michael Turrin:
Hey, great. Thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats for me as well on the metrics working in concert here. Amy, maybe on margin, impressive to hear expectations for flat operating margin in the upcoming year as you absorb some of the mix shift towards Azure and some of the more AI-focused offerings? Can you speak in more detail just around your ability to manage those trade-offs and offset some of the mix shift? And I'm wondering, specifically just on any productivity gains you're seeing from leveraging AI internally that you'd highlight or anything else you just mentioned in underpinning the full year expectation there? Thank you.
Amy Hood:
Thanks, Michael. I think really the area to focus on is when you think about margin, I think sometimes people get a lot of energy around cost control as a driver of margin. The other driver is to focus on making sure you deliver great product that's competitive and innovative and can take share. Because that drives revenue. And revenue itself and revenue growth, as you all know better, even perhaps than I do, is a durable way to see margin improvement. It builds on itself.
That being said, the second thing I would point to is really what I talked to Cash a little bit about before, Satya and I both mentioned it, is applying all of our skill set here to deliver efficiencies. Whether that's at whatever layer of the stack that exists. The S-curves compound, and we are doing that work and we're focused on it at the same time we're doing the build-out. So you'll see improvements there even as we continue, to invest. And then, of course, it's about continuing to have great talent here, focus on products and opportunities where we have the biggest markets. And the most likelihood of success.
And so when we have those three things happen, and the energy is right, and the focus is there, gives me confidence in terms of margin delivery. But make no mistake, starts and ends really with product. Which is what we're really focused on here and delivering that to customers.
Michael Turrin:
That all sounds pretty good. Thanks very much.
Jonathan Neilson:
Thanks, Michael. That wraps up the Q and A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you all soon.
Satya Nadella:

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year on year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center.
Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year on year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential Data Center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer Internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue.
Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud providers' investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time-to-train models, the lowest cost to train models, and the lowest cost to inference large language models.
For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.ai, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, XAi, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs.
Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. NVIDIA Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical.
A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kick-started a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute.
In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out.
In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models.
Some are procuring and operating sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud-native AI supercomputer.
In Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Centre is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jump-start their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year.
The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward.
From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2.
The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years.
With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 grew, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year.
Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe; Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the U.K.; and JUPITER in the Julich Supercomputing Centre in Germany.
We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the No. 1, the No. 2, and the No.
3 spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2.
In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet-only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI.
We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper.
The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion-parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hoppers launched and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads, and data center environments in the first-year shipments.
Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and XAi. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices, or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton and PrintServer, and TensorRT-LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics, and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock, and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake, and Stability AI.
NIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year on year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range.
From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor cores. Now, with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts, and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT-LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex.
Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. And top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent, and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and non-playable characters. Moving to ProViz, revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year on year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth.
At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3DXCITE, Dassault Systems brand, and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year.
Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners, to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Moving to automotive.
Revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year on year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI Cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets.
We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper, and Nuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. OK, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets.
As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments. In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10 as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis.
We are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms.
GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full-year opex is expected to grow in the low 40% range.
GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments.GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen as he would like to make a few comments.

Thanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun.
Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost- and energy-efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power.
The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on the Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video, and 3D and learn to reason and plan.
Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full-stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction. From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing.
AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan, and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general-purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills and, at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, sovereign AI, automotive, and healthcare customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.
The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects, and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere from the cloud to on-prem data centers, to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners.
From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- it doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore.
What does that mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now?
Jensen Huang

We will be shipping -- well, we've been in production for a little bit of time. But our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4.

UBS -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just given the system's nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So, do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Yep. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air-cooled, liquid-cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X, and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC -- that I showed at GTC.
And so, for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so, Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell.
We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain; beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional.

Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull ahead or a holding behavior because of tight supply, competition, or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Well, I guess there's the big picture view that I'll come to, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now, it's going to be multi-modality, Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic, and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there.
There's also a long line of generative AI start-ups, some 15,000, 20,000 start-ups that are in all different fields, from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application, productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video so that they can train end-to-end models to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars, the list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand those up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data, to train their regional models.
And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So, anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. That's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work.
And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven-only computer.
It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do. And it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan, and come back with a solution. And so, every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers.
And so, that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the start-ups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary.

Great. Thank you. Understanding what you just said about how strong demand is, you have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Operating Officer
We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.

Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys.
To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing mostly internal workloads, or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation.
It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so, the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT-LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three.
That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So, one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics, to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So, accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing.
And so, the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data centers. Second, we're in every cloud. And so, for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem.
We're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so, that's the second reason.
The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem.
It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so, the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective, in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value to you is $5 billion.
All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so, the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters in everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money.
And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so, the highest performance is also the lowest TCO.

Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Matt Ramsay

TD Cowen -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training, some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference.
And it's an amazing thing to watch but it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on is going to be not as competitive with your new stuff very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So, I'd like you to, if you wouldn't mind, speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, they're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path.
Thank you.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build-out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can.
And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, OK? And so, there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance-average your way into it.
So, that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them.
Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable, and getting this thing called time-to-train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so, the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important.
And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership that want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so, leadership matters a great deal. Time-to-train matters a great deal. The difference between time-to-train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time-to-train on three months' project, getting started three months earlier is everything.
And so, it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so, that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly, because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center, and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything.
We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides to look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale.
And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now, one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here but then we disaggregate it and integrate it into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform, and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them, and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance.
This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so, we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation.
So, I appreciate it. Those are the three points.

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down.
And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So, the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so, then the question is, does the general-purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general-purpose framework? Thank you.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general purpose. Like, for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing.
And so, the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose computing, not for accelerated computing. And so, I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities, maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded.
5% of the code represents 99% of the run time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now, and now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context.
All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so, each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model but to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software: that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily 1 million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it, and we're ready for it.
And so, the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.

Thanks for taking my question. I'm actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about -- I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half, if you could elaborate, any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Operating Officer
I didn't hear your questions. Something bleeped out.
Simona Jankowski

Vice President, Investor Relations
H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Well, you know, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so, those matters are true.
However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there, and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell toward the end of the year.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri

Raymond James -- Analyst
Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small.
So, I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO, or is it something else? Or is it just the architecture? Thank you.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense, and we integrate it into computer makers.
We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even.
And so, you're going to see liquid-cooled version, air-cooled version, x86 versions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed.
Now, of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously, the integration of CPUs, and the much more compressed density of computing. Liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so, it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center.
And everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking -- of course, NICs. We have Ethernet now so that we can bring AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so, Blackwell is much more expansive.
We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
William Stein

Truist Securities -- Analyst
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there were reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth to bring to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper or Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side whereby, while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected.
The interconnect between the two chips -- calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like at terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR.
It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so, we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so, you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain.
That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so, we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so, there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so, if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it.
And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so, it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs.
Operator
Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse
--
Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst
Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking.
And amid rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation? And your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive, CUDA, precision, Grace, Cohere, and connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And you can also count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet.
But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market.
And so, for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet to network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric.
And we're committed, fully committed, to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain, to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so, we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so, you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming.
And all of it -- the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So, if you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers, and everything just runs.
And so, I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so, we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens, and we're going to do that at scale. Thank you.

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Thanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year on year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with Data Center.
Data Center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year on year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5x. Networking revenue grew more than 2x from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% of our Data Center revenue, and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer Internet and enterprise companies.
Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our Data Center growth include generative AI model training and inferencing; video, image, and text data pre and post processing with CUDA and AI workloads; synthetic data generation; AI-powered recommender systems; SQL and Vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue.
Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our Data Center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and start-ups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud.
CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and a significant contributor to our Data Center revenue.
As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell platform combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA, with the top computer manufacturers, unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers.
With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, and Link Switch and the networking chips, systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30x faster inference for LLM's workloads and unlocking the ability to run trillion-parameter models in real time. Hopper demand is strong, and Blackwell is widely sampling.
We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to get several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.
Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings.
Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprises, including xAI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6x the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of GPUs today to millions of DPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on track to begin a multibillion-dollar product line within a year.
Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI Bridging Cloud Infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started.
Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%.
ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual copilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake, serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers, is working with NVIDIA to build copilots.
And lastly, is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multibillion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Health care is also on its way to being a multibillion-dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery.
During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1 collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications.
NVIDIA NIMs accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowes, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and eight times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem.
We announced NIM Agent Blueprint, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM Agent Blueprint, enterprises can refine their AI applications over time, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM Agent Blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to enterprises.
NVIDIA NIM and NIM Agent Blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS, and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PC. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year on year.
We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue, and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AI PC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designed from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI.
NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies is available for RTX AI PCs. Megabreak is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small language model, Nemotron 4B optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow. Recently added RTX and DLSS titles include Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Vanguard.
The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. Moving to pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year on year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads.
Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz, signed multiyear contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins of factories.
We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI copilots and agents into USD workloads, accelerating our ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing the USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as The Coca-Cola Company. Moving to automotive and robotics. Revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year on year.
Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramp in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving upscale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Boston Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsyc, Siemens, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L.
GAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within Data Center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion toward shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per shareholder.
Our board of directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products.
We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our Data Center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid- to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.
Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please help us poll for questions?
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And as a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there's a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back-end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite the change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing, what that means to your kind of revenue profile and how are customers reacting to it.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary.
And so, we're sampling functional samples of Blackwell, Grace Blackwell, and a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex, and we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari

Analyst
Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customers' customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of capex going forward.
Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts capex? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook and how should we think about fiscal '26? Thank you.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out, I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production but shipping up. On the longer-term question, let's take a step back. And you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time.
The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time and it has slowed to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year.
And so, if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so, the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications.
It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing, but what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition, going from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost.
And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x. You would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multitrillion-parameter models and train it on -- pretrain it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so which caused the generative AI revolution. Now, generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just the capability.
It's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what are the expected answers. What are our previous observations? And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function.
It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so, you could learn the function of almost anything. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so, now here we are with generative AI.
It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms, and the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So, the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale.
And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the data set to go train it. And so, the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so, it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation.
So, we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. And so, the first one is there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities. And surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so, you have more and more and more.
That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are ChatGPT image generators. We see coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now.
We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems, largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs. It's now moving from CPUs to generative AI.
So, recommender systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper-targeting, search, and user-generated content, these are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI start-ups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners. And sovereign AI, countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting, and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform to the world's enterprises.
The companies that we're talking to, so many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of the company. And then general robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse, we are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about, start building general robotics. And so, you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going.
And so, we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.
Colette M. Kress
--
Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So, more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So, yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore
--
Analyst
Great. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible. But it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong.
I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So, how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activities, new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like.

Yeah. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong. And it's true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible.
There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look at the world's cloud service providers, the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane.
It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words. But almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Panda's data, data science toolkits like Panda's, and the new one, Polar's.
These are the ones -- the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, NVIDIA's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so, number one is the primary -- the No. 1 use case long before generative AI came along is that the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing.
The second is, of course, the rentals. They're renting capacity to model makers. They're renting it to start-up companies. And a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products.
And so, these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money. They want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do.
You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so, there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. The first person to the next plateau gets to be -- get to introduce a revolutionary level of AI.
The second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so, the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that, and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and the AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SoCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace.
We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why we drive ourselves so hard. Of course, we also want to see our dreams come true and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future and the benefits that we can bring to society, we want to see all that come true. And so, these model makers are the same.
Of course, they want to be the world's best. They want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so, between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic.
And so, everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it. They need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper.
Of course, H200 is state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so, I think people are just clamoring to transition the $1 trillion of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure and Hopper's state-of-the-art.

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Jensen, I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about the ROI on all of this capex. And hopefully, this question and the distinction will make some sense.
But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier toward AGI convergence and, as you just said, a new plateau in capability, and they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on capex versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment. Thanks.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so, one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through it is just go back to first principles.
You have $1 trillion worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so, because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so, the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money.
That's a tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. And so, recommender systems save money, so on and so forth, OK? And so, you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI.
And so, your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system? So, for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so, there's a lot of ways you could think through it.
But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA.
That's the best way to do it.

And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri

Analyst
Thanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth, both near and longer term. I know Colette, you did increase opex for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish.
On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling, and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power supply chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you can speak to that. Thanks.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Executive Officer
I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So, remember, the world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers.
$1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear: because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don't experience computing inflation.
Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we could all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so, I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next $1 trillion of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last $1 trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta.
And I think it was Volta. And so, we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled.
However, the number of data centers that want to go to liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can, in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power-limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from three to five times the AI throughput compared to the past. And so, liquid cooling is cheaper. Liquid cooling, our TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink, which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs.
And so, imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink. And that, we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously very low latency, very high throughput large language model inference, and the large NVLink domain is going to be a game changer for that. And so, I think people are very comfortable deploying both.
And so, almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so, I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our Data Center business quite significantly next year.
Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles, remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time. And that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing, and human-engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence-learned software.
OK.

And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have two short questions for Colette. The first several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4, is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half.
Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins. If I have mid-70s for the year, let's say, where I want to draw that, if I have 75 for the year, I'd be something like 71 to 72 for Q4, somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.
Colette M. Kress

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
So, Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So, we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So, let's say, Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that.
Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting ramping in Q4. So, I hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3.
We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75 in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75. So, we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4, again with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions.
However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are.

Melius Research -- Analyst
Yeah. Hey, thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out, and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially.
Just wondering what the dynamics are there. And obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks. What are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter, given all those favorable revenue dynamics.
Thanks.
Colette M. Kress

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure in a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. The pieces in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to, and so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be and where it may even travel to the end customer.
These are just moving to our OEMs or ODMs and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So, what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time to time. But yes, our China number there are invoicing to China.
Keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also Data Center, also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement and regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing.
Determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that that will be a growth opportunity in Q4.
On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture.

And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse

Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more, given rising complexity in a rather limit advanced package world.
So, curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships, and then taking through a consequential impact to your margin profile? Thank you.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to continue to drive its cost down.
It's growing so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models, that we'll reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so, we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale.
We have the ability, fairly uniquely, to integrate, to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year unless you have all the parts. And so, we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX for East and West, BlueField DPUs for North and South, and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers, to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so, the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this, we have one architectural stack, as you know, it allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it.
Otherwise, what happens, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to, and then you've got to build -- somebody's got to build up an AI factory, and the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so, it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro. We used to be able to serve ZTE.
They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so, the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers, the scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrators, integrated supply chain, is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so, that part, we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it.
Well, yes. So, anyways, that's the reason why.
Operator
And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers
--
Analyst
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink, you think about GB NVL72 and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle.
I guess to put it simply, how do you see that mix of rack scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack but it's sold in disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack.
And the reason for that is because everybody's rack's a little different surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not. Some of them are enterprise. And the power limits for everybody could be a little different.
Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so, the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components.
Like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant.
And so, just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it's got to be close to. It has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs, from that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so, you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we've scaled out to with our ODM partners.
And so, I think because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration.
That's their value-add. There's a final design-in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center but the design fit-in is really complicated. And so, the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world.
And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So, integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator, we want to be a technology provider.
Operator
And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. The data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.
Let me highlight the top five things, the top five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate everything possible.
Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including CUDA-X Accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, CUVI-S for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now.
Ariel and for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number one.
Number two, Blackwall is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just the GPU. Also happens to be the name of our GPU but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear.
The Blackwell vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize, the Gray CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a colos package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-size computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform, full stack end to end, from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounds of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures.
Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing.
The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72 GB200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10x higher than Hopper. 259 terabytes per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multitrillion-parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so, that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU.
For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput large language model token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating.
Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems.
AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity, and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI, general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started, and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of Nemo, NIMs, NIM Agent Blueprints, and AI Foundry that our ecosystem partners, the world-leading IT companies used to help companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications.
Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise run time, and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA software, TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Thank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continue to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year on year and well above our outlook of $32.5 billion.
All market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with data center. Another record was achieved in data center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year on year.
NVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional, and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest prod ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2x faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our data center sales with revenue increasing more than 2x year on year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of DPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads.
NVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave, and Microsoft Azure, with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped year on year as North America, India, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA Cloud instances and sovereign cloud build-outs. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year on year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models training, multimodal, and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers.
NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCO improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5x in one year and cut time to first token by 5x. Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper inference performance by an additional 2.4x.
Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full-stack, full-infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLink.
And from liquid-cooled to air-cooled, every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse data center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering, and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us.
Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer, in private preview, Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200 and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2x leap in performance over Hopper.
The results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. The 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4x reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLink Switch enables up to 30x faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling, throughput, and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created.
Hundreds of AI-native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Though Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners, Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Light Tricks, Harvey, Podium, Purser, and the Bridge are seeing great success while thousands of AI-native start-ups are building new services. The next wave of AI are Enterprise AI and industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle.
NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIMs micro services is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Copilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises.
Accenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture, with over 707,000 employees, is leveraging NVIDIA-powered agentic AI applications internally, including one case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns for 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM, and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI Enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI Enterprise full-year revenue to increase over 2x from last year, and our pipeline continues to build.
Overall, our software, service, and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world, like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents. We built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics.
Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer, is using digital twin and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring-up of its Blackwell factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our data center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products to industries.
As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remained well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI.
India's leading CSPs include product communications and data services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10x. Infosys, TFC, Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand.
SoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and ARN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the U.S. with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC, and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise, and major consulting companies, including EY Strategy and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries.
Networking revenue increased 20% year on year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. Though networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing, and we anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters.
NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3x year on year. And our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their compute.
Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus 100,000-Hopper supercomputer experienced zero application latency degradation and maintained 95% of data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now, moving to Gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year on year. Q3 was a great quarter for Gaming with notebook, console, and desktop revenue all growing sequentially and year on year.
RTX end demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as consumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming, creative, and AI applications. Channel inventory remains healthy, and we are gearing up for the holiday season. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PC with up to 321 AI TOPS from ASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4. These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo, and video editing, image generation, and coding.
This past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming executing graphics to igniting the AI revolution. NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz.
Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year on year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases, and generative AI content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive.
Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year on year. Strong growth was driven by self-driving brands of NVIDIA Orin and robust end market demand for NAVs. Global Cars is rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. OK, moving to the rest of the P&L.
GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher-cost systems within data center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure, and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter.
Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products. While demand greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On Gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth-quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.
Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with seven different types of NVIDIA-built chips, multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low 70s. When fully ramp, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center-scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on December 3 in Scottsdale.

Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled.
Obviously, we're very early here, but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So, is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.

Our foundation model pretraining scaling is intact, and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough, that we've now discovered two other ways to scale.
One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback, and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what is called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces.
And it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question. And so, we now have three ways of scaling, and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great.
You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so, that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so, the demand is really great for all of those reasons.
But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference.
And so, we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage.
And so, we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places.

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year.
There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B.
On supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this, or is it specifically HBN? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks. So, let's see. Back to the first question.
Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so, the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply.
And that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so, Blackwell demand is very strong.
Our execution is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up.
You have systems from Microsoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so, all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated.
And the reason for that is because, although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer, and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world. That integration process, it's something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.
And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace.
And the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so, the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain.
And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company; Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron; Spill Amcor; KYEC; and there's Foxconn and the factories that they've built; and Quanta and Wiwynn; and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super Micro, Lenovo. And the number of companies is just really quite incredible. Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping of Blackwell, which I really appreciate.
And so, anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're on an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course, of our platform.
But it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing. We're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed size.
It could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's -- most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so, on the one hand, our annual road map reduces costs.
But on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so, that annual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intention of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.

Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than -- I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that.
But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So, I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell will cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So, I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So, you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April.
I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Executive Officer
Colette, why don't you start?
Colette M. Kress

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our gross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins, as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning, and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first program.
So, you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that round.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Executive Officer
Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so, that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant.
The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so, machine learning is also what enables generative AI.
And so, on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something.
Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so, we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is.
It's unlike a data center of the past. And so, these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so, we expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.

Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main question, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just at the start of Blackwell? So, how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?
Colette M. Kress
--
Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
OK. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes.
But yes, it is definitely possible.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if you just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's capex -- if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have plenty of old data centers.
And so, what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. But let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion dollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning.
That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type of capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the world's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything.
It's something that's completely brand new. It's, in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so, we're going to see more and more companies like that.
And they're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey, digital marketing intelligence like Rider's, so on and so forth.
And the number of these companies, these -- what are they called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every platform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall. There were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies.
Now, they're AI natives. And so, these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something completely new. And so, my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low 70s gross margins, does 73.5% count as low 70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next quarter must be up several billion dollars.
But it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.
Colette M. Kress
--
Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
So, first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well.
We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year, so we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out.
It is an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different configurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to build out their Blackwell.
So, we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes. Is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's possible, but we'll just have to see.

Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling influence projects.
But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age, that you could use some of the Hopper chips for inference. So, I guess do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time frame? And just generally, your thoughts there.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so, we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7 and that there will be a whole bunch of AI native start-ups, thousands of AI native start-ups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens.
And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I used the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it.
And so, I think that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI, if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI. Just those large language models understand the human language and how the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world.
And it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't. And not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so, that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about.
And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is -- so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback. Instead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI.
And so, that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference, and we're starting to see that growth happening. So, I'm super excited about that. Now, let me just say one more thing.
Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build.
And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand. They want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so, the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger.
They're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work.
And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so, that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.

Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think about the data center business. When I look at the results this last quarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was down about 15% sequentially.
But then your comments were that you were seeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CFP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So, I'm curious if you could unpack what's going on in the Networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about.

Let's first start with the networking. The growth year over year is tremendous. And our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of in the data center. The networking is such a critical part of that.
Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So, this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems we are providing them to.

So, first, starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and the work that they are doing. So, our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI.
This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of in the Asia Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So, our Gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast.
Now, the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more supply as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.

Yeah. Hi. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth.
So, very strong sequential growth this quarter, and you're guiding to about 7%. Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply just in the first half, there would be some catch-up. So, I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the U.S.
and the China situation, have you gotten any sense or any conversations about tariffs or anything with regard to your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's probably too early, but wondering if you had any thoughts there. Thanks so much.

We are working right now on the quarter that we're in and building what we need to ship in terms of Blackwell. We have every supplier on the planet working seamlessly with us to that. And once we get to next quarter, we'll help you understand in terms of that ramp that we'll see to the next quarter going after that.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Executive Officer
Whatever the new administration decides, we'll, of course, support the administration. And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that, do the best we can and just as we always do. And so, we have to simultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along fully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and to compete in the marketplace.
We'll do all of these three things simultaneously.

Your final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your line is open.
Pierre Ferragu

Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in your comments, you have the pretraining, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and inference as well and then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining? How much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And whatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so, you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and reflection.
And so, I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models, and the amount of petabytes video that these foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so, my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pretraining, post-training, as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute. And we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution going.

Thank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by two fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning, from executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI.
Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago.
The computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing.
AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data.
The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us, and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise, scale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure lets us serve the entire multitrillion-dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead from every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional AI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics.
Thanks for joining us today, and catch up next time.

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Thanks, Stewart. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up 12% sequentially and up 78% year on year and above our outlook of $37.5 billion. For fiscal 2025 revenue was $130.5 billion, up 114% from the prior year.
Let's start with Data Center. Data center revenue for fiscal 2025 was $115.2 billion, more than doubling from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, Data Center revenue of $35.6 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and 93% year on year as the Blackwell ramp commenced and Hopper 200 continued sequential growth. In Q4, Blackwell sales exceeded our expectations.
We delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history, unprecedented in its speed and scale. Blackwell production is in full-year across multiple configurations, and we are increasing supply quickly expanding customer adoption. Our Q4 Data Center compute revenue jumped 18% sequentially and over 2x year on year.
Customers are racing to scale infrastructure to train the next generation of cutting-edge models and unlock the next level of AI capabilities. With Blackwell, it will be common for these clusters to start with 100,000 GPUs or more. Shipments have already started for multiple infrastructures of this size. Post-training and model customization are fueling demand for NVIDIA infrastructure and software as developers and enterprises leverage techniques such as fine-tuning reinforcement learning and distillation to tailor models for domain-specific use cases.
Hugging Face alone hosts over 90,000 derivatives freighted from the Llama foundation model. The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude, more compute than pretraining. Our inference demand is accelerating, driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models like OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Grok 3. Long-thinking reasoning AI can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences.
Blackwell was architected for reasoning AI inference. Blackwell supercharges reasoning AI models with up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost versus Hopper 100. It is revolutionary transformer engine is built for LLM and mixture of experts inference. And its NVLink Domain delivers 14x the throughput of PCIe Gen 5, ensuring the response time, throughput, and cost efficiency needed to tackle the growing complexity of infants of scale.
Companies across industries are tapping into NVIDIA's whole STAG inference platform to boost performance and slash costs. Now, tripled inference throughput and cut costs by 66%, using NVIDIA TensorRT for its screenshot feature. Perplexity sees 435 million monthly queries and reduced its inference costs 3x with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server and TensorRT-LLM. Microsoft Bing achieved a 5x speed up at major TCO savings for visual search across billions of images with NVIDIA, TensorRT, and acceleration libraries.
Blackwell has great demand for inference. Many of the early GB200 deployments are earmarked for inference, a first for a new architecture. Blackwell addresses the entire AI market from pretraining, post-training to inference across cloud, to on-premise, to enterprise. CUDA's programmable architecture accelerates every AI model and over 4,400 applications, ensuring large infrastructure investments against obsolescence in rapidly evolving markets.
Our performance and pace of innovation is unmatched. We're driven to a 200x reduction in inference costs in just the last two years. We delivered the lowest TCO and the highest ROI. And full stack optimizations for NVIDIA and our large ecosystem, including 5.9 million developers continuously improve our customers' economics.
In Q4, large CSPs represented about half of our data center revenue. and these sales increased nearly 2x year on year. Large CSPs were some of the first to stand up Blackwell with Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI bringing GB200 systems to cloud regions around the world to meet certain surging customer demand for AI. Regional cloud hosting NVIDIA GPUs increased as a percentage of data center revenue, reflecting continued AI factory build-outs globally and rapidly rising demand for AI reasoning models and agents.
We've launched a 100,000 GB200 cluster-based incidents with NVLink Switch and Quantum 2 InfiniBand. Consumer Internet revenue grew 3x year on year, driven by an expanding set of generative AI and deep learning use cases. These include recommender systems, vision, language understanding, synthetic data generation search, and agentic AI. For example, xAI is adopting the GB200 to train and inference its next generation of Grok AI models.
Meta's cutting-edge Andromeda advertising engine runs on NVIDIA's Grace Hopper Superchip serving vast quantities of ads across Instagram, Facebook applications. Andromeda harnesses Grace Hopper's fast interconnect and large memory to boost inference throughput by 3x, enhance ad personalization, and deliver meaningful jumps in monetization and ROI. Enterprise revenue increased nearly 2x year on accelerating demand for model fine-tuning, RAG, and agentic AI workflows, and GPU-accelerated data processing. We introduced NVIDIA Llama Nemotron model family NIMs to help developers create and deploy AI agents across a range of applications including customer support, fraud detection, and product supply chain and inventory management.
Leading AI agent platform providers, including SAP and ServiceNow, are among the first to use new models. Health care leaders IQVIA, Illumina, Mayo Clinic, and Arc Institute are using NVIDIA AI to speed drug discovery enhanced genomic research and Pioneer advanced healthcare services with generative and agentic AI. As AI expands beyond the digital world, NVIDIA infrastructure and software platforms are increasingly being adopted to power robotics and physical AI development. One of the early and largest robotics applications and autonomous vehicles where virtually, every AV company is developing on NVIDIA in the data center, the car, or both.
NVIDIA's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year. At CES, Hyundai Motor Group announced it is adopting NVIDIA technologies to accelerate AV and robotics development and smart factory initiatives. Vision transformers, self-supervised learning, multimodal sensor fusion, and high-fidelity simulation are driving breakthroughs in AV development and will require 10x more compute. At CES, we announced the NVIDIA COSMO World Foundation model platform.
Just as language, foundation models have revolutionized Language AI, Cosmos is a physical AI to revolutionize robotics. The robotics and automotive companies, including ridesharing giant Uber, are among the first to adopt the platform. From a geographic perspective, sequential growth in our Data Center revenue was strongest in the U.S., driven by the initial ramp up Blackwell. Countries across the globe are building their AI ecosystem as demand for compute infrastructure is surging.
France's EUR 100 billion AI investment and the EU's EUR 200 billion invest AI initiatives offer a glimpse into the build-out to set redefined global AI infrastructure in the coming years. Now, as a percentage of total Data Center revenue, data center sales in China remained well below levels seen on the onset of export controls. Absent any change in regulations, we believe that China shipments will remain roughly at the current percentage. The market in China for data center solutions remains very competitive.
We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Networking revenue declined 3% sequentially. Our networking attached to GPU compute systems is robust at over 75%. We are transitioning from small NVLink 8 with InfiniBand, to large NVLink 72 with Spectrum-X.
Spectrum-X and NVLink Switch revenue increased and represents a major new growth vector. We expect networking to return to growth in Q1. AI requires a new class of networking. NVIDIA offers NVLink Switch systems for scale-up compute.
For scale-out, we offer quantum incentive for HPC supercomputers and Spectrum X for Ethernet environments. Spectrum-X enhances the Ethernet for AI computing and has been a huge success. Microsoft Azure, OCI, CoreWeave, and others are building large AI factories with Spectrum-X. The first Stargate data centers will use Spectrum-X.
Yesterday, Cisco announced integrating Spectrum-X into their networking portfolio to help enterprises build AI infrastructure. With its large enterprise footprint and global reach, Cisco will bring NVIDIA Ethernet to every industry. Now, moving to gaming and ARPCs. Gaming revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 22% sequentially and 11% year on year.
Full-year revenue of $11.4 billion increased 9% year on year, and demand remains strong throughout the holiday. However, Q4 shipments were impacted by supply constraints. We expect strong sequential growth in Q1 as supply increases. The new GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop and laptop GPUs are here.
Build for gamers, creators, and developers they fuse AI and graphics redefining visual computing, powered by the Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor cores, and fourth-generation RT cores and featuring UQ's400AI tops. These GPUs deliver a 2x performance leap and new AI-driven rendering including neuro shaders, digital human technologies, geometry, and lighting. The new DLSS 4 boost frame rates up to 8x with AI-driven frame generation, turning one rendered frame into three. It also features the industry's first real-time application of transformer models packing 2x more parameters and 4x to compute for unprecedented visual fidelity.
We also announced a wave of GeForce Blackwell laptop GPUs with new NVIDIA Max-Q technology that extends battery life by up to an incredible 40%. These laptops will be available starting in March from the world's top manufacturers. Moving to our professional visualization business. Revenue of $511 million was up 5% sequentially and 10% year on year.
Full-year revenue of $1.9 billion increased 21% year on year. Key industry verticals driving demand include automotive and healthcare. NVIDIA Technologies and generative AI are reshaping design, engineering, and simulation workloads. Increasingly, these technologies are being leveraged in leading software platforms from ANSYS, Cadence, and Siemens fueling demand for NVIDIA RTX workstations.
Now, moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $570 million, up 27% sequentially and up 103% year on year. Full-year revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% year on year. Strong growth was driven by the continued ramp in autonomous vehicles, including cars and robotaxis.
At CES, we announced Toyota, the world's largest automaker will build its next-generation vehicles on NVIDIA Orin running the safety-certified NVIDIA DriveOS. We announced Aurora and Continental will deploy driverless trucks at scale powered by NVIDIA Drive Thor. Finally, our end-to-end autonomous vehicle platform NVIDIA Drive Hyperion has passed industry safety assessments like TUV SUD and TUV Rheinland, two of the industry's foremost authorities for automotive-grade safety and cybersecurity. NVIDIA is the first AV platform that received a comprehensive set of third-party assessments.
OK. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 73% and non-GAAP gross margin was 73.5% and down sequentially as expected with our first deliveries of the Blackwell architecture. As discussed last quarter, Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA build chips multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data center.
We exceeded our expectations in Q4 in ramping Blackwell, increasing system availability, providing several configurations to our customers. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to be in the low 70s. Initially, we are focused on expediting the manufacturing of Blackwell systems to meet strong customer demand as they race to build out Blackwell infrastructure. When fully ramped, we have many opportunities to improve the cost, and gross margin will improve and return to the mid-70s, late this fiscal year.
Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 9% and non-GAAP operating expenses were 11%, reflecting higher engineering development costs and higher compute and infrastructure costs for new product introductions. In Q4, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Let me turn to the outlook in the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $43 billion, plus or minus 2%.
Continuing with its strong demand, we expect a significant ramp of Blackwell in Q1. We expect sequential growth in both Data Center and Gaming. Within Data Center, we expect sequential growth from both compute and networking. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 70.6% and 71%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.
GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. We expect full-year fiscal year '26 operating expenses to grow to be in the mid-30s. GAAP and non-GAAP other incoming expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million. excluding gains and losses from nonmarketable and publicly held equity securities.
GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website, including a new financial information AI agent. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the TD Cowen Health Care Conference in Boston on March 3 and at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 5.
Please join us for our Annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 17 in San Jose, California. Jensen will deliver a news-packed keynote on March 18, and we will host a Q&A session for our financial analysts for the next day, March 19. We look forward to seeing you at these events. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for May 28, 2025.
We are going to open up the call, operator, to questions. If you could start that, that would be great.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse
--
Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess for me, Jensen, as test-time compute and reinforcement learning shows such promise, we're clearly seeing an increasing blurring of the lines between training and inference.
What does this mean for the potential future of potentially inference dedicated clusters? And how do you think about the overall impact to NVIDIA and your customers? Thank you.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I appreciate that, C.J. There are now multiple scaling laws. There's the pre-training scaling law, and that's going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is post-training skilling, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards.
The amount of computation you use for post-training is actually higher than pretraining. And it's kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you're using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post-trade.
And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is test-time compute or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling. They're all basically the same ideas. And there, you have a chain of thought, you have search. The amount of tokens generated the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning.
And that's just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even, hopefully, extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today is in our future. And so, the question is, how do you design such an architecture? Some of it -- some of the models are auto-regressive.
Some of the models are diffusion-based. Some of it -- some of the times you want your data center to have disaggregated inference. Sometimes, it is compacted. And so, it's hard to figure out what is the best configuration of a data center, which is the reason why NVIDIA's architecture is so popular.
We run every model. We are great at training. The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference and Blackwell takes all of that to a new level. We designed Blackwell with the idea of reasoning models in mind.
And when you look at training, it's many times more performing. But what's really amazing is for long thinking test time scaling, reasoning AI models were tens of times faster, 25x higher throughput. And so, Blackwell is going to be incredible across the board. And when you have a data center that allows you to configure and use your data center based on are you doing more pretraining now, post-training now, or scaling out your inference, our architecture is fungible and easy to use in all of those different ways.
And so, we're seeing, in fact, much, much more concentration of a unified architecture than ever before.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore

JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Morgan Stanley, actually. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about GB200 at CES, you sort of talked about the complexity of the rack-level systems and the challenges you have. And then as you said in the prepared remarks, we've seen a lot of general availability.
Where are you in terms of that ramp? Are there still bottlenecks to consider at a systems level above and beyond the chip level? And just have you maintained your enthusiasm for the NVL72 platforms?
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I'm more enthusiastic today than I was at CES. And the reason for that is because we've shipped a lot more since CES. We have some 350 plants manufacturing the 1.5 million components that go into each one of the Blackwell racks, Grace Blackwell racks. Yes, it's extremely complicated.
And we successfully and incredibly ramped up Grace Blackwell, delivering some $11 billion of revenues last quarter. We're going to have to continue to scale as demand is quite high, and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems. You've probably seen on the web, a fair number of celebrations about Grace Blackwell systems coming online and we have them, of course. We have a fairly large installation of Grace Blackwell for our own engineering and our own design teams and software teams.
CoreWeave has now been quite public about the successful bring-up of theirs. Microsoft has, of course, OpenAI has, and you're starting to see many come online. And so, I think the answer to your question is nothing is easy about what we're doing, but we're doing great, and all of our partners are doing great.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya
--
Analyst
Thank you for taking my question. Colette if you wouldn't mind confirming if Q1 is the bottom for gross margins? And then Jensen, my question is for you. What is on your dashboard to give you the confidence that the strong demand can sustain into next year? And has DeepSeek and whatever innovations they came up with, has that changed that view in any way? Thank you.
Colette M. Kress
--
Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Well, let me first take the first part of the question there regarding the gross margin. During our Blackwell ramp, our gross margins will be in the low 70s. At this point, we are focusing on expediting our manufacturing, expediting our manufacturing to make sure that we can provide to customers as soon as possible. Our Blackwell is fully round.
And once it does -- I'm sorry, once our Blackwell fully rounds, we can improve our cost and our gross margin. So, we expect to probably be in the mid-70s later this year. Walking through what you heard Jensen speak about the systems and their complexity, they are customizable in some cases. They've got multiple networking options.
They have liquid-cooled and water-cooled. So, we know there is an opportunity for us to improve these gross margins going forward. But right now, we are going to focus on getting the manufacturing complete and to our customers as soon as possible.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
We know several things, Vivek. We have a fairly good line of sight of the amount of capital investment that data centers are building out toward. We know that going forward, the vast majority of software is going to be based on machine learning. And so, accelerated computing and generative AI, reasoning AI are going to be the type of architecture you want in your data center.
We have, of course, forecasts and plans from our top partners. And we also know that there are many innovative, really exciting start-ups that are still coming online as new opportunities for developing the next breakthroughs in AI, whether it's agentic AIs, reasoning AI, or physical AIs. The number of start-ups are still quite vibrant and each one of them needs a fair amount of computing infrastructure. And so, I think the -- whether it's the near-term signals or the midterm signals, near-term signals, of course, are POs and forecasts and things like that.
Midterm signals would be the level of infrastructure and capex scale-out compared to previous years. And then the long-term signals has to do with the fact that we know fundamentally software has changed from hand-coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning and AI-based software that runs on GPUs and accelerated computing systems. And so, we have a fairly good sense that this is the future of software. And then maybe as you roll it out, another way to think about that is we've really only tapped consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI, advertising, recommenders, kind of the early days of software.
The next wave is coming, agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics, and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI for their own ecosystems. And so, each one of these are barely off the ground, and we can see them. We can see them because, obviously, we're in the center of much of this development and we can see great activity happening in all these different places and these will happen. So, near term, midterm, long term.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur

Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Your next-generation Blackwell Ultra is set to launch in the second half of this year, in line with the team's annual product cadence.
Jensen, can you help us understand the demand dynamics for Ultra given that you'll still be ramping the current generation Blackwell solutions? How do your customers and the supply chain also manage the simultaneous ramps of these two products? And is the team still on track to execute Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year?
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Blackwell Ultra is second half. As you know, the first Blackwell was we had a hiccup that probably cost us a couple of months. We're fully recovered, of course.
The team did an amazing job recovering and all of our supply chain partners and just so many people helped us recover at the speed of light. And so, now we've successfully ramped production of Blackwell. But that doesn't stop the next train. The next train is on an annual rhythm and Blackwell Ultra with new networking, new memories, and of course, new processors, and all of that is coming online.
We have been working with all of our partners and customers, laying this out. They have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everybody to do the proper transition. This time between Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because we went from an NVLink 8 system to an NVLink 72-based system.
So, the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition. But the next transition will slot right in Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners on the click after that.
And the click after that is called Vera Rubin and all of our partners are getting up to speed on the transition of that and so preparing for that transition. And again, we're going to provide a big, huge step-up. And so, come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin and then show you what we place after that. Really exciting new products to come to GTC piece.

Thanks a lot. Jensen, we heard a lot about custom ASICs. Can you kind of speak to the balance between customer ASIC and merchant GPU? We hear about some of these heterogeneous superclusters to use both GPU and ASIC. Is that something customers are planning on building? Or will these infrastructures remain fairly distinct? Thanks.
Jensen Huang

President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we built very different things than ASICs, in some ways, completely different in some areas we intercept. We're different in several ways. One, NVIDIA'S architecture is general whether you're -- you've optimized for unaggressive models or diffusion-based models or vision-based models or multimodal models, or text models. We're great in all of it.
We're great on all of it because our software stack is so -- our architecture is sensible. Our software stack ecosystem is so rich that we're the initial target of most exciting innovations and algorithms. And so, by definition, we're much, much more general than narrow. We're also really good from the end-to-end from data processing, the curation of the training data, to the training of the data, of course, to reinforcement learning used in post-training, all the way to inference with tough time scaling.
So, we're general, we're end-to-end, and we're everywhere. And because we're not in just one cloud, we're in every cloud, we could be on-prem. We could be in a robot. Our architecture is much more accessible and a great target initial target for anybody who's starting up a new company.
And so, we're everywhere. And the third thing I would say is that our performance in our rhythm is so incredibly fast. Remember that these data centers are always fixed in size. They're fixed in size or they're fixing power.
And if our performance per watt is anywhere from 2x to 4x to 8x, which is not unusual, it translates directly to revenues. And so, if you have a 100-megawatt data center, if the performance or the throughput in that 100-megawatt or the gigawatt data center is four times or eight times higher, your revenues for that gigawatt data center is eight times higher. And the reason that is so different than data centers of the past is because AI factories are directly monetizable through its tokens generated. And so, the token throughput of our architecture being so incredibly fast is just incredibly valuable to all of the companies that are building these things for revenue generation reasons and capturing the fast ROI.
And so, I think the third reason is performance. And then the last thing that I would say is the software stack is incredibly hard. Building an ASIC is no different than what we do. We build a new architecture.
And the ecosystem that sits on top of our architecture is 10 times more complex today than it was two years ago. And that's fairly obvious because the amount of software that the world is building on top of architecture is growing exponentially and AI is advancing very quickly. So, bringing that whole ecosystem on top of multiple chips is hard. And so, I would say that -- those four reasons.
And then finally, I will say this, just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again. There are a lot of chips that get built, but when the time comes, a business decision has to be made, and that business decision is about deploying a new engine, a new processor into a limited AI factory in size, in power, and in fine. And our technology is not only more advanced, more performance, it has much, much better software capability and very importantly, our ability to deploy is lightning fast.
And so, these things are enough for the faint of heart, as everybody knows now. And so, there's a lot of different reasons why we do well, why we win.

Yeah. Hi. Ben Reitzes here. Hey, thanks a lot for the question.
Jensen, it's a geography-related question. You did a great job explaining some of the demand underlying factors here on the strength. But U.S. was up about $5 billion or so sequentially.
And I think there is a concern about whether U.S. can pick up the slack if there's regulations toward other geographies. And I was just wondering, as we go throughout the year, if this kind of surge in the U.S. continues and it's going to be -- whether that's OK.
And if that underlies your growth rate, how can you keep growing so fast with this mix shift toward the U.S.? Your guidance looks like China is probably up sequentially. So, just wondering if you could go through that dynamic and maybe collect can weigh in. Thanks a lot.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters. It's about half of what it was before the export control. But it's approximately the same in percentage. With respect to geographies, the takeaway is that AI is software.
It's modern software. It's incredible modern software, but it's modern software and AI has gone mainstream. AI is used in delivery services everywhere, shopping services everywhere. If you were to buy a quart of milk, it's delivered to you.
AI was involved. And so almost everything that a consumer service provides AIs at the core of it. Every student will use AI as a tutor, healthcare services use AI, financial services use AI. No fintech company will not use AI.
Every Fintech company will. Climate tech companies use AI. Mineral discovery now uses AI. The number of -- every higher education, every university uses AI and so I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream and that it's being integrated into every application.
And our hope is that, of course, the technology continues to advance safely and advance in a helpful way to society. And with that, we're -- I do believe that we're at the beginning of this new transition. And what I mean by that in the beginning is, remember, behind us has been decades of data centers and decades of computers that have been built. And they've been built for a world of hand coding and general-purpose computing and CPUs and so on and so forth.
And going forward, I think it's fairly safe to say that world is going to be almost all software to be infused with AI. All software and all services will be based on -- ultimately, based on machine learning, the data flywheel is going to be part of improving software and services and that the future computers will be accelerated, the future computers will be based on AI. And we're really two years into that journey. And in modernizing computers that have taken decades to build out.
And so, I'm fairly sure that we're in the beginning of this new era. And then lastly, no technology has ever had the opportunity to address a larger part of the world's GDP than AI. No software tool ever has. And so, this is now a software tool that can address a much larger part of the world's GDP more than any time in history.
And so, the way we think about growth, and the way we think about whether something is big or small has to be in the context of that. And when you take a step back and look at it from that perspective, we're really just in the beginning.

Hi. It's Mark. Thanks for taking the question. I had a clarification and a question.
Colette up for the clarification. Did you say that enterprise within the data center grew 2x year on year for the January quarter? And if so, does that -- would that make it the fast faster growing than the hyperscalers? And then, Jensen, for you, the question, hyperscalers are the biggest purchasers of your solutions, but they buy equipment for both internal and external workloads, external workflows being cloud services that enterprise is used. So, the question is, can you give us a sense of how that hyperscaler spend splits between that external workload and internal? And as these new AI workflows and applications come up, would you expect enterprises to become a larger part of that consumption mix? And does that impact how you develop your service, your ecosystem? Thank you.
Colette M. Kress

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Sure. Thanks for the question regarding our Enterprise business. Yes, it grew 2x and very similar to what we were seeing with our large CSPs. Keep in mind, these are both important areas to understand.
Working with the CSPs can be working on large language models, can be working on inference in their own work. But keep in mind, that is also where the enterprises are servicing. Your enterprises are both with your CSPs as well as in terms of building on their own. They're both growing quite well.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
The CSPs are about half of our business. And the CSPs have internal consumption and external consumption, as you say. And we're using -- of course, used for internal consumption. We work very closely with all of them to optimize workloads that are internal to them because they have a large infrastructure of NVIDIA gear that they could take advantage of.
And the fact that we could be used for AI on the one hand, video processing on the other hand, data processing like Spark, we're fungible. And so, the useful life of our infrastructure is much better. If the useful life is much longer, then the TCO is also lower. And so, the second part is how do we see the growth of enterprise or not CSPs, if you will, going forward? And the answer is, I believe, long term, it is by far larger and the reason for that is because if you look at the computer industry today and what is not served by the computer industry is largely industrial.
So, let me give you an example. When we say enterprise, and let's use the car company as an example because they make both soft things and hard things. And so, in the case of a car company, the employees will be what we call enterprise and agentic AI and software planning systems and tools, and we have some really exciting things to share with you guys at GTC, build agentic systems are for employees to make employees more productive to design to market plan to operate their company. That's agentic AI.
On the other hand, the cars that they manufacture also need AI. They need an AI system that trains the cars, treats this entire giant fleet of cars. And today, there's 1 billion cars on the road. Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars, and they'll all be collecting data, and we'll be improving them using an AI factory.
Whereas they have a car factory today, in the future, they'll have a car factory and an AI factory. And then inside the car itself is a robotic system. And so, as you can see, there are three computers involved and there's the computer that helps the people. There's the computer that build the AI for the machineries that could be, of course, could be a tractor, it could be a lawn mower.
It could be a human or robot that's being developed today. It could be a building. It could be a warehouse. These physical systems require new type of AI we call physical AI.
They can't just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence, and cause and effect. And all of those type of things that are common sense to you and I, but AIs have to go learn those physical effects. So, we call that physical AI. That whole part of using agentic AI to revolutionize the way we work inside companies, that's just starting.
This is now the beginning of the agentic AI era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it, and we got some really great things going on. And then there's the physical AI after that, and then there are robotic systems after that. And so, these three computers are all brand new. And my sense is that long term, this will be by far the larger of a mall, which kind of makes sense.
The world's GDP is representing -- represented by either heavy industries or industrials and companies that are providing for those.

Aaron Rakers

Analyst
Yeah. Thanks for letting me back in. Jensen, I'm curious as we now approach the two-year anniversary of really the Hopper inflection that you saw in 2023 in GenAI in general. And when we think about the road map you have in front of us, how do you think about the infrastructure that's been deployed from a replacement cycle perspective and whether if it's GB300 or if it's the Rubin cycle where we start to see maybe some refresh opportunity? I'm just curious how you look at that.
Jensen Huang
--
President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I appreciate it. First of all, people are still using Voltas and Pascals, and Amperes. And the reason for that is because there are always things that because CUDA is so programmable you could use it Blackwell, one of the major use cases right now is data processing and data curation.
You find a circumstance that an AI model is not very good at. You present that circumstance to a vision language model, let's say, it's a car. You present that circumstance to a vision language model. The vision language model actually looks in the circumstances, said, this is what happened and I was very good at it.
You then take that response to the prompt, and you go and prompt an AI model to go find in your whole lake of data other circumstances like that, whatever that circumstance was. And then you use an AI to do domain randomization and generate a whole bunch of other examples. And then from that, you can go train the bottle. And so, you could use an peers to go and do data processing and data curation and machine learning-based search.
And then you create the training data set, which you then present to your Hopper systems for training. And so, each one of these architectures are completely -- they're all CUDA-compatible and so everything wants on everything. But if you have infrastructure in place, then you can put the less intensive workloads onto the installed base of the past. All of us are very well employed.

Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on gross margins for Colette. So, I understand there are many moving parts the Blackwell yields, NVLink 72, and Ethernet mix.
And you kind of tipped to the earlier question the April quarter is the bottom, but second half would have to ramp like 200 basis points per quarter to get to the mid-70s range that you're giving for the end of the fiscal year. And we still don't know much about tariff impact to broader semiconductor, so what kind of gives you the confidence in that trajectory in the back half of this year?
Colette M. Kress

Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our gross margins, they're quite complex in terms of the material and everything that we put together in a Blackwell system, a tremendous amount of opportunity to look at a lot of different pieces of that on how we can better improve our gross margins over time. Remember, we have many different configurations as well on Blackwell that will be able to help us do that.
So, together, working after we get some of these really strong ramping completed for our customers, we can begin a lot of that work. If not, we're going to probably start as soon as possible if we can. If we can improve it in the short term, we will also do that. Tariff at this point, it's a little bit of an unknown it's an unknown until we understand further what the U.S.
government's plan is, both its timing, it's where, and how much. So, at this time, we are awaiting, but again, we would, of course, always follow export controls and/or tariffs in that manner.

President and Chief Executive Officer
I just wanted to thank you. Thank you, Colette. The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning.
With resenting AI, we're observing another scaling law, inference time or test time scaling, more computation. The more the model thinks the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAI, Grok 3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute.
Future reasoning models can consume much more compute. DeepSeek-R1 has ignited global enthusiasm. It's an excellent innovation. But even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model.
Nearly every AI developer is applying R1 or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques like R1 to scale their model's performance. We now have three scaling laws, as I mentioned earlier, driving the demand for AI computing. The traditional scaling loss of AI remains intact. Foundation models are being enhanced with multimodality, and pretraining is still growing.
But it's no longer enough. We have two additional scaling dimensions: post-training scaling, where reinforcement learning, fine-tuning, model distillation require orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining alone; inference time scaling and reasoning where a single query and demand 100x more compute. We defined Blackwell for this moment, a single platform that can easily transition from pre-trading, post-training, and test time scaling. Blackwell's FP4 transformer engine and NVLink 72 scale-up fabric and new software technologies led Blackwell process reasoning AI models 25 times faster than Hopper.
Blackwell in all of this configuration is in full production. Each Grace Blackwell NVLink 72 rack is an engineering marvel. 1.5 million components produced across 350 manufacturing sites by nearly 100,000 factory operators. AI is advancing at light speed.
We're at the beginning of reasoning AI and inference time scaling. But we're just at the start of the age of AI, multimodal AIs, enterprise AI sovereign AI and physical AI are right around the corner. We will grow strongly in 2025. Going forward, data centers will dedicate most of capex to accelerated computing and AI.
Data centers will increasingly become AI factories, and every company will have either rented or self-operated. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Come join us at GTC in a couple of weeks. We're going to be talking about Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and other new computing, networking, reasoning AI, physical AI products, and a whole bunch more.
Thank you.

RISKS
Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi noted, Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion, driven primarily by a $1.4 billion charge related to a legal settlement and higher R&D expenses.
Ashkenazi stated, Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate further in Q3 2025, indicating continued margin pressure from higher depreciation expense.
Management highlighted that year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on US elections in the second half of 2024, particularly on YouTube, which may create challenging advertising comps for the remainder of 2025.
Ashkenazi said, ""We expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment going into 2026."" signaling ongoing capacity constraints for Google Cloud despite increased investment.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Sundar Pichai:
Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us with robust growth across the company. As you saw at I/O, we are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. This quarter, search delivered double-digit revenue growth. Our new search features continue to perform well. AI mode has launched in the US and India and is going well, while AI overviews now have over two billion monthly users across more than two hundred countries and territories and forty languages. I'll give some more details on search in a moment.
We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions, reflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the US, Shorts now earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on YouTube, and in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate. Cloud had another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog, and profitability. Annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated full-stack approach to AI.
This spans AI infrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring AI to people all over the world. I'll briefly touch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights. First, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs along with storage and software built on top. That's why nearly all Gen AI unicorns use Google Cloud, and it's why a growing number, including leading AI research labs like SAFE Superintelligence and Physical Intelligence, use TPU specifically. Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth and demand from cloud customers.
Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to expand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide industry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In addition to improving our popular workhorse model, Flash, we debuted an extremely fast Flash Lite version. We achieved gold medal level performance in the International Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with Deep Tech. We can't wait to bring DeepTink to users soon. We have some of the best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have been a catalyst for growth, and nine million developers have now built for Gemini. I also want to mention VO3, our state-of-the-art video generation model.
It's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app and with our new AI filmmaking tool, Flow. Since May, over seventy million videos have been generated using VO3, and we recently introduced a feature in the Gemini app to turn photos into videos, which people absolutely love. It's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today. Third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners through surfaces like Workspace, Grow, and Mold. The growth in usage has been incredible. At I/O in May, we announced that we processed four hundred and eighty trillion monthly tokens across our surfaces.
Since then, we have doubled that number, now processing over nine hundred and eighty trillion monthly tokens—a remarkable increase. The Gemini app now has more than four hundred and fifty million monthly active users, and we continue to see strong growth in engagement, with daily requests growing over fifty percent from Q1. In June alone, over fifty million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by VO3, our new short video product in Workspace called Google Meets reached nearly one million monthly active users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new Android and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices.
And we are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost from our Google AI Pro and Ultra plans. Now some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube, and Waymo for the quarter. First up, this is an incredibly exciting moment for Search. We see AI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing information, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask Google. Overall queries and commercial queries on search continue to grow year over year, and our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users to search more as they learn that search can meet more of their needs.
That's especially true for younger users. Let me go deeper on our new search experiences. We know how popular AI overviews are because they are now driving over ten percent more queries globally for the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to increase over time. AI overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering the fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the use of multimodal search, particularly the combination of Lens or Circle to Search, together with AI overviews. This growth was most pronounced among younger users. Our new end-to-end AI search experience, AI mode, continues to receive very positive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions.
It's still rolling out but already has over one hundred million monthly active users in the US and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI mode experience for users by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research tool, Deep Search, and more personalized responses. Next, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand driven by our product differentiation and our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show this. One, the number of deals over $250 million doubling year over year. Two, in the first half of 2025, we signed the same number of deals over $1 million that we did in all of 2024. Three, the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% quarter over quarter.
More than eighty-five thousand enterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce, and Singapore's DBS Bank, now build with Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year over year. Our models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-leading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference. Along with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage, including Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70%, and Rapid Storage, which delivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to leading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages, including PyTorch and JAX, with full open-source support for various AI training and serving demands. We've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products.
Wayfair is leveraging our databases integrated with AI to streamline data pipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences. Mattel is leveraging our Gemini-powered data agents and BigQuery to review and act on product feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered threat intelligence and security operations agents to improve cybersecurity. Capgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher quality software faster by automating tasks from code generation to testing. And BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace are saving employees nearly three hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it out to one hundred thousand employees globally. We are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem.
We introduced an open-source agent development kit, which now has over a million downloads in less than four months. We also introduced AgentSpace, an open and interoperable enterprise chat, search, and agent platform. Gordon Foodservice is bringing AgentSpace to its US employees, which is enabling better, more efficient decision-making. And over one million subscriptions have been booked for AgentSpace ahead of its general availability. Turning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led US streaming watch time for over two years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on their devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and content on their televisions. That includes millions of sports fans too.
Globally, they consume more than forty million hours of sports content on YouTube annually. And in September, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday game of the season live from Brazil. From sports to Shorts, we now average over two hundred million daily views on YouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto-dubbing, which translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically increasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began rolling out a whole draft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts. Finally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently expanding its premium light offerings to fifteen new countries, with more to come.
And lastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more riders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than doubled its Austin service territory, and expanded its Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area territories by approximately fifty percent. Waymo also launched teen accounts, starting with riders aged fourteen to seventeen in Phoenix. Overall, great momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over one hundred million miles on public roads, and the team is testing across more than ten cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve riders in all ten in the future. As I said, a standout quarter.
A big thank you as always to our employees and partners for an amazing Q2.
Philipp Schindler:
Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube, and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up 12% year on year, driven by strong growth in search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to our results, the 12% increase in search and other revenues was led by growth across all verticals, with the largest contribution from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar performance across verticals, with 30% growth in advertising revenues driven by direct response, followed by brand.
Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter. Shifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native multimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual world back into the online world, creating a number of opportunities for search. Let me share a few examples. Take visual queries. Google Lens searches are one of the fastest-growing query types on search and grew 70% since this time last year. The majority of Lens searches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth in shopping queries using Lens. And you can obviously take this to the next level by moving from image to video-based capabilities like SearchLive.
Then there's Circle to Search, which is now on over three hundred million Android devices. We've been adding capabilities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI overview or answers. And just last week, we brought a new agenda capability directly into search for all US users with AI-powered calling to local businesses. Finally, shopping. In Q2, we introduced a virtual try-on experience for SearchLabs users in the US. Now people can try billions of clothing products on themselves virtually.
Early results and engagement have been extremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users, and we'll be bringing this functionality to all US users imminently. All these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use technology, bringing the offline world into the online world in ways that simply have not been possible before. Add in our amazing AI translation capabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more content in their language, and businesses large and small, international or local, can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these elements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search.
Moving to ads, where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process with AI is delivering value for our customers and our business. Last quarter, we introduced AI Max in Search, a new suite of AI-powered features and existing search campaigns. Advertisers that activate AI Max in search campaigns typically see 14% more conversions. On media buying, Smart Bidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade, brings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on less obvious but potentially higher value queries more often. Campaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration see a 19% increase in conversions on average. DemandGen continues to drive revenue growth and deliver measurable impact for our customers.
As an example, Depop, Etsy's resale clothing marketplace, used the Shorts-only DemandGen campaign to drive new customers to the site. Shorts drove 80% brand lift and double click-through rates versus benchmarks. On creatives, we launched AssetStudio using our latest models to help businesses large and small generate creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top-quality assets and deployment scaling capabilities, but larger businesses can go faster from proof of concept to launch and resize at lower costs. Over two million advertisers now use Google's AI-powered asset generation tools to run ads, a 50% increase on this time last year. Turning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by direct response followed by brand.
YouTube creators are connected to the global zeitgeist and trusted by their audiences like no others. As part of BrandConnect, we launched Creator Partnership Hub, which allows brands to more easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We introduced VO3, photo-to-video, and generative effects to Shorts, making content creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity. We're seeing both the volume and the price of ads in Shorts increase, particularly in developed markets. The feed-based nature of the product allows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further supported by ad formats native to Shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing tools, improved ad targeting, and the rise in viewer engagement.
McDonald's USA harnessed the influence of YouTube creators to ignite awareness for the Minecraft Movie Meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts partnership ads to increase its reach, generating a 3.3 times higher view-through rate than the industry benchmark. Finally, on CTV, where the momentum continues. According to the Gauge report by Nielsen, YouTube has been number one in streaming watch time in the US for more than two years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in June 2025. In the past twelve months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove over one billion conversions.
We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV shopping ads, which allow viewers to shop directly via QR codes, helping us leverage direct marketing opportunities. As always, I'll wrap up with the momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where our customers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them transform their business with AI. For instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital commerce experience for their merchants and customers. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing, and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the availability and functionality of PayPal's payment services capabilities across a range of Google products.
In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success and to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you.
Anat Ashkenazi:
Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025. We had another solid quarter in Q2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion increased by 14% or 13% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices, and Google Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter, reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $39 billion, up 10%.
TAC was $14.7 billion, up 10%, and other costs of revenue were $24.3 billion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation. Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth was expense for legal and other matters, which reflected the impact of a $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal matters. R&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and promotional expenses. Operating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3 billion, and operating margin was 32.4%.
Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Net income increased 19% to $28.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31. We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7 billion for the trailing twelve months. Free cash flow in the second quarter was affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax payments as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1 and Q2. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results.
Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion, reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other revenues increased by 12% to $54.2 billion. Search and other revenues delivered growth across all verticals, with the largest contributions coming from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenue of $7.4 billion was down 1%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was driven by YouTube subscription offerings, followed by Google One, with the growth in paid subscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth.
Google Services operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion. Operating margin was flat year on year at 40.1% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiency in our expense base were partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which delivered very strong results this quarter. Revenues increased by 32% to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at a rate that was much higher than cloud's overall revenue growth, and growth in Google Workspace driven by an increase in average revenue per seat and the number of seats. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 11.3% to 20.7%.
The expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes the associated depreciation. As we ramp our AI investments, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity and efficiency to offset growth in technical infrastructure-related expenses, particularly from higher depreciation. Google Cloud backlog increased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year over year, reaching $106 billion at the end of the quarter. This growth was driven by strong demand for our products and services from both new and existing customers. As Sundar mentioned, we have signed multiple billion-dollar-plus deals in the first half of the year.
As for Other Bets, in the second quarter, revenue was $373 million, and operating loss was $1.2 billion. Within Other Bets, we're allocating more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional value. With respect to CapEx, in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure, with approximately two-thirds of investments in servers and one-third in data centers and networking equipment. In Q2, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchase of stock of $13.6 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion.
Turning to our outlook, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second half of 2025, as well as an updated outlook for full-year CapEx. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the business. At current spot rates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in Q3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q3 revenue.
As for our segments, in Google Services, advertising revenues in the second half of 2025 will be affected by the following: the continued lapping of the strength we experienced in financial service verticals throughout 2024, and year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on US elections in the second half of 2024, particularly on YouTube. In Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high, as evidenced by the continued revenue growth and the cloud backlog of $106 billion. We have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployment. We expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment going into 2026.
Moving to investments, given the strong demand for our cloud products and services, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion. Our updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers, and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we're seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company. We will provide more details on the 2026 CapEx outlook in a future earnings call.
In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year over year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate further in Q3. Second, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In the third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in total headcount additions due in part to the hiring of new graduates.
And third, Q3 will reflect the expense associated with the upcoming August launch of the new Pixel family of products. In conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the momentum in the business and excited about the pace of innovation. Our full-stack approach, which combines AI infrastructure, AI research, and AI products and platforms, positions us well to deliver new products and services across the company. We're seeing great momentum with our AI efforts, as demonstrated by the increase in cumulative token process. Search revenues are seeing healthy growth with features like AI overviews, AI mode, and Lens offering new ways for users to access information.
Cloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and is delivering margin expansion while continuing to invest to meet customer demand. And YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building new services like Shorts, which now averages over two hundred billion daily views. We're excited to see the value our products and services are bringing to customers and partners around the globe. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Sundar, Philipp, and I will take your questions.
Operator:
Thank you. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Your first question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Eric Sheridan:
Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, when you think about the journey you're on with respect to the evolution of products and platforms, how do you think about some of the implications of changing consumer behavior and how investors should think about that from the volume perspective versus the monetization perspective? Because I think there's a lot of longstanding dynamics out there about clicks and click monetization that might be very different when you look out over the next three to five years. And, Philipp, when you think about the evolution of YouTube, you made a number of comments there about subscription revenue.
I'm just curious how you think about the mix of advertising versus subscription and what some of your key learnings might have been as the
Sundar Pichai:
Thank you. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate the question. I do think looking ahead, based on everything we are seeing, people are excited about AI. They are adopting it well across our products. For me, just seeing multimodality help people have modified their behavior to include images both through Lens and Circle to Search seamlessly as part of interacting with Google. The early indications are that people are going to be adopting through these moments very, very well. I think I'm trying to understand your question in terms of clicks and click monetization. Maybe that's something Philipp can touch on.
But overall, we expect as we build out our organic experiences, we have a good understanding of how to continue training on monetization, so that'll work well with organic experiences. But we will lead with organic experience. So in terms of newer services like the Gemini app, etc., we'll focus on the organic experience for the near term. But just like we are doing with AI overviews and with AI mode over time, we'll be able to bring very, very good commercial experiences there as well, and we think people will adapt to them as they've always done. Maybe Philipp can add more. Philipp?
Philipp Schindler:
Yeah. So on your question on YouTube subscription versus ads, look, I mean, we love our ads business. We love our subscription. YouTube subscriptions are increasingly important for YouTube. We'll definitely continue our long-term focus here. We had strong growth across YouTube subscription products, which includes, just to be clear, YouTube TV, YouTube Music, and Premium. And I think one common theme for our subscription services in general is offering viewers more choice here. We also have a very deep understanding of the monetization side here. Where are we monetizing more with ads? Where can we potentially monetize more with subscriptions? So I think we will continue this as a double-tier strategy, active going forward.
Eric Sheridan:
Thank you.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Doug Anmuth:
Thanks so much for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, can you just talk about how you're thinking about your current access to compute even as you spend $10 billion more this year in CapEx? You also said that you're still in a tight supply environment, so just trying to marry those. And then, Philipp, on search growth, can you talk a little bit about paid click and pricing growth just within the 12% search growth and how we should think about volume versus monetization trends going forward? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai:
Doug, thanks. On the CapEx stuff, obviously, we are seeing strong momentum across our portfolio, and especially in cloud. You are right. It's a tight supply environment, and we are investing more to expand, but there is obviously a time delay between this additional investment will play out in future years. And so, that's why both of them are true at the same time. But we are planning ahead and we are investing, and it's exciting to see the traction, particularly in cloud.
I think the comprehensiveness of our AI portfolio, the breadth of our offerings, both providing our models on GPUs and TPUs for our customers, all of that has been really driving demand, and so we are investing to match up to it.
Philipp Schindler:
Look, to be very clear, I think we said this before, we manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users and an attractive ROI for our advertisers. We actually don't manage to pay clicks and CPC targets. Some of the product and policy changes we make actually drive better monetization at the expense of paid clicks. You will actually see in the 10-Q paid clicks were up 4% year on year, but a number of factors affect these metrics from quarter to quarter, such as a few examples, advertiser spending, product changes, policy changes, user engagement, and so on.
So it's really important when it comes to paid clicks and CPCs to avoid drawing overly broad conclusions solely based on these metrics.
Doug Anmuth:
Thank you.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak:
Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Sundar, there's a lot of discussion about agentic search for commercial activities and agents that can be broadly deployed. Maybe could you just, from a technology perspective, when you sit down with the engineering teams working on some of these new agentic capabilities that could come, what are some of the predominant technological hurdles they need to be cleared in order to launch scalable agents for commercial queries? That's the first one. Second one, I think in the past, you've updated us on stats on sources of internal efficiency you've seen from Gen AI-enabled capabilities. Any updates there?
And then any sort of learnings on trick points that also need to be overcome for some of these internal tools with Gen AI? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai:
Thanks, Brian. Let me start with the first one on agenting capabilities. We are definitely, in many ways, when we built 2.5, our series of 2.5 models, particularly with Pro, etc., it's the direction where we are investing the most. There's definitely exciting progress, including the models we haven't fully released yet. The main gaps we are all trying to do is, you're obviously chaining a sequence of events. And so being able to do it reliably, the latency compounds, the cost compounds. And being able to do it reliably in a way for the users, all of this comes together. In each of this, we are making progress; it all needs to kind of hang together.
The good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are at the frontier there. And in all of these areas, when you look back on a twelve-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any given capability. So the forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really unlock these agentic experiences. We see the potential. We're able to do them, but they're a bit slow and costly and take time and sometimes are brittle. But we're making progress on all of that. And I think that's what will really unlock. And I expect 2026 to be the year in which people kind of use agent experiences more broadly. So it's an exciting opportunity ahead.
On the second part, I think when you say source of internalization, I presume you're talking about how we are using all of this internally. Again, given you've asked a question about agents, we are now beginning to roll out agent coding journeys for our software engineers within the company. And it's been exciting to see just over the last few months, particularly over the last few weeks, people are definitely doing more agentic workflows in software engineering as well internally.
And that's a good example of the kind of the same experiences a few months ago had a lot of friction points, but we are overcoming it and people are beginning to use it internally on the coding side as well as in certain other areas of the company as well. So exciting progress. I expect it to be an active area where we will roll out journeys for our users as well, so I'm still looking forward to it.
Brian Nowak:
Thanks, Sundar. That's great.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael Nathanson:
Thanks. Sundar, I have two for you. At I/O, you announced a partnership with Warby Parker to develop glasses. So I wonder if you share your view of how important a cycle of new devices will be to further scale AI and do you envision a world in which the mobile phone is no longer central to our consumer experience? That's one. And secondly, how does Google Search with AI mode usage differ versus Gemini standalone apps? I'm wondering if you see any differences in usage or the types of consumers who go to the app versus who go to traditional search with AI. Thanks.
Sundar Pichai:
Thanks, Michael. On the first thing, look, I think anytime AI changes, you can drive new experiences, including on hardware experiences too. So I think AI will particularly enable, you've long had the promise of glasses and other form factors. I think AI will spur a whole new wave of innovation there. We are super excited about our investment in glasses, and found experiences have taken a dramatic step up compared to the last iteration. So I think it'll be an exciting new emerging category. But I still expect phones to be at the center of the experience for the next two to three years at least.
And so I still think that's going to be phones would continue to be at the center of the consumer experience. But we are excited about the emerging categories as well. On your second question on AI mode versus Gemini standalone app, broadly, there are some use cases where you can get a great experience in both places. But there are use cases that are very specific. I think where the queries are information-oriented, but people really wanted to rely on the information, but have the full power of AI. I think AI mode really shines in that. You can go there and you know it's backed up. The Gemini models are using search deeply as a tool.
And so it's on-ground and in that search experience, and I think users are responding very positively to it. Whereas in the Gemini standalone app, you see everything from people can have a long conversation or chat just kind of pass time, in the Gemini app. You've seen early cases where people may get into it in a therapy-like experience. So these are all emerging experiences of what people do, and I think this is why I'm glad we have both surfaces. And we can innovate in both of these areas. And, of course, there'll be areas that will be commonly served by both applications, and over time, I think we can make the experience more seamless for our users.
Michael Nathanson:
Excellent, Sundar.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Mark Shmulik:
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, it seems there's almost like a daily news report about the AI talent war and high-profile folks moving around, which is kind of like your perspective on how you think Google's been doing in both kind of attracting and retaining key AI talent. And along similar lines, how do we think about AI-related resourcing costs alongside the step-up in capital investments required to go build for AI? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai:
Mark, on the first question, look, I think we've gone through these moments before. We've obviously always deeply invested in talent, including in AI talent for well over a decade now, and I think we have an extraordinary both breadth and depth of the talent. In my experience, the top people look for a combination of they want to really be at the frontier driving progress, and so the mission and how state-of-the-art your work is matters. So that's super important to them, access to compute resources, and access to your peers. Working with the best people in the industry, and it's a combination of all of that and using it to drive impact.
And I think we are pretty competitive on all those fronts. And through this moment, we continue to either at both our retention metrics as well as the new talent coming in. And both are healthy. I do know individual cases can make headlines, but when we look at numbers deeply, I think we are doing very well through this moment. And we'll continue investing in the people and the talent and the compute needed to make sure we are set up for the opportunity ahead. Maybe I'll pass it on to Anat.
Anat Ashkenazi:
Yeah. And on the question on how we integrate this into our overall cost structure, and I've mentioned before, having the benefit of having the full stack includes research, which is our people and one of our most critical resources. So we make sure that we invest appropriately to have the best brightest minds in the industry sitting here at Google and advancing our innovation to customers. It is part of what you're seeing now in our operating expense line across the organization, but we're also working hard to offset not just growth and investment across the business, but also to ensure that we can allocate resources appropriately. So Sundar mentioned earlier the use of AI tools within the company.
So that's another area where we can drive efficiency across the business is to use these tools internally in terms of how we run the organizations. And then we're continuing on the same efforts that I've talked about before with regards to running the company with a high level of discipline execution and driving efficiency across the business.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Ross Sandler:
Great. If I can have two, that'd be great. The first one's on search click-through rates as a driver of monetization. So you guys have done a great job over the past decade of driving better ad relevancy and higher click-through rates in search. Just curious as we look forward and we see lower ad impressions per SERP, and all these things that are changing with AI overviews and different AI search formats, do you feel about your ability to drive CTR going forward? And then the second question is, it looks like you're now working with OpenAI for some aspect of cloud infrastructure. Just curious how that relationship might expand in the future. Thank you.
Philipp Schindler:
I can take the first one. Look. Specifically, you're referring to the AI overview. So understood your question correctly. Sundar mentioned it. They continue to drive higher satisfaction. They continue to drive higher search users. They're scaling up very nicely, and they're actually working for our entire user base now, scaled to over two billion users and over two hundred countries. So very happy with this development. When it comes specifically to the monetization of it, we talked about it before. We see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us actually a really strong base on which we can then innovate and drive actually more innovative and new and next-generation ad formats.
That's how we look at it at this moment in time.
Sundar Pichai:
On the second part with respect to OpenAI, we are very excited to be partnering with them on Google Cloud. Google Cloud is an open platform, and we have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs, etc. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side. And we look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing it there.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney:
Okay. Two questions, please. First, can you just describe maybe Philipp what you see in terms of the ad environment maybe for the back half of the year? You know, maybe versus last year? Does it seem as certain or as uncertain as it was last year? The results seem pretty strong. Are there any unusual concerns you would have for the back half of the year? And then Sundar, I want to ask again about the two surfaces approach to search. And, you know, you obviously got some, you must have some internal metrics that tell you that's the optimal way for you to approach the market.
But, you know, there's I'm sure there's a counterargument that just having that unified search and being able to discern the intent of the search, whether it's pure information or commercial, just from the query that could give you a material advantage over other offerings in the market. Just talk a little bit about what metrics you've seen that make the two surface solution seem to be optimal. Thank you.
Philipp Schindler:
So let me start. Look. We said our ad business performed strongly in Q2. Give you maybe some vertical color of it in Q2, search and other performance was led by growth across all verticals. We mentioned the largest contributions from retail and financial services, which was probably due actually to strength in insurance. We saw healthcare as a sizable contributor to growth as well. Look, we're only a few weeks into Q3, so I think it's really too early to comment on anything happening in the second half of the year.
Sundar Pichai:
On the second part of the question. Look, I think between these two surfaces, you pretty much, you know, you're covering the entire breadth and depth of what humanity can possibly do. So I think there's plenty for two surfaces to tackle at this moment. Obviously, you know, search is more information-focused. And we think of the Gemini app as more your assistant, more personal, proactive, and powerful assistant for every aspect of your daily life. And so you can imagine wanting to call deeply or create a long video, etc. Like, you know, those things can be done by the Gemini app today better.
Over time, like we've always done, we've gone through these evolutions before, like, as you point out. You know, we can understand user intent better and abstract some of the complexity for our users. At one point, people used to go to, you know, query separately for text differently from images, differently from videos, etc. And we kind of made it all seamless with universal search. So we have the experience of being able to bring together experiences in a way that makes sense for users. And do the heavy lifting for them.
But I think, you know, when you're in this early stage of new emerging paradigms, I think we want to make sure we can meet them where they are expecting today. And over time, I think, it'll give us an opportunity to serve them better. So I think that's how we are thinking about it.
Mark Mahaney:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.
Ken Gawrelski:
Thank you very much. Two, if I may, please. The first on cloud, I'm just hoping maybe you could clarify your back half outlook given last quarter, you talked about some supply constraints that would ease towards the end of 2025, but yet you put up a really nice acceleration in Q2. Now you're talking about some supply constraints easing into 2026. If you could just clarify a little bit on the back half outlook for cloud, given the strong results in Q2. And then the second is a bigger picture question, which is an agentic experience. Does it democratize the web like search did two decades ago?
Enabling discovery in the long tail, or does it lead to more concentration with a smaller group of vertical winners? Would love it if you could opine on that. Thank you.
Anat Ashkenazi:
Okay. On your first question on the cloud second half outlook and the comments I previously made with regards to where we're going to see the capacity increase. So, obviously, we're working hard to bring more capacity online, which means data centers and servers are coming online, and we see more of an increase towards the back end of the year. But we're increasing capacity with every quarter that goes by, as you can see with the growth rates we've had both this quarter and in the previous quarter. As Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that's a light switch. It takes time to make this investment.
So what you're seeing now is investment we made some time ago that's now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year. I will say it's important as you think about cloud growth not to think about this in a linear fashion. Because the quarter-on-quarter growth rates could depend on the timing of capacity delivery and when that comes online. So that could move a little bit from quarter to quarter.
Sundar Pichai:
Look. On the agent experience. Look, I think, those earlier questions on the technology aspects of it and how we are making progress. Obviously, there is the value proposition for all the players involved, and I think that's going to be an equally important thing to create the unlock here. And I do think, over time, users will, you know, it's clear to me as we make progress on the agentic experience, it's going to be a much better experience for users. Right? And so you'll find savvier players leaning into these experiences, and that'll help them grow and meet this moment. And I think I do think it's an opportunity for some of the players.
And so you are right. Just like the early days of the web, there are aspects about it that will expand access, grow the use cases, etc. And I think those elements are there. But I do think it's important. It's not just a technology claim, but we have to solve the business models for the varying players involved. So and I think that's going to be an important part of this evolution as well. Thank you.
Operator:
And our last question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Your line is now open.
Justin Post:
Great. Thank you. A couple for Sundar. First, it looks like the subscription businesses are all tracking well, and you know, certainly, Gemini 2.5 has got some much good reviews. How are you doing with Gemini subscriptions? I know it's a focus area for the company. And anything you can kind of do to accelerate the consumer subscriptions of Gemini within Google One? And then secondly, just on the course change of CapEx, obviously, a bigger increase, which appears to be because of cloud demand. But just your comments on cloud ROI and, I'm sorry, CapEx ROI. What gives you confidence so you're going to get good returns on that spend? Thank you.
Sundar Pichai:
Great. On the first thing on subscriptions, you know, we've definitely, yeah. Google One has been an attractive value proposition powered by storage. But with now, our AI plans, including both Pro and Ultra, and particularly with the 2.5 series of models, they've definitely seen accelerated transactions. It was a very healthy quarter, and so we are definitely excited about the opportunities ahead. And you will find, you know, through this moment, I think we'll be able to drive growth in that area based on our AI offerings. And so it's definitely an area we are both excited by, and we are actually seeing traction particularly in the last quarter ever since we introduced 2.5 Pro.
So we are excited about the trajectory there. On the CapEx on the cloud side, look, I think we are definitely investing because we are delivering a lot of value through our cloud offerings, and I think it's important to understand, you know, as we build more and more of an installed base with Google Cloud, you know, we have very high customer satisfaction. Our churn rates are very low. And we are much more efficient in the investments needed to grow those lines of businesses. So you are seeing all that play out in our margin trajectory, particularly if you look at it annually sequentially over the past few years.
And so all of that gives us confidence as we are investing in this. You know, we'll be able to have a healthy ROI on our investments. And particularly in this AI moment, you know, there's definitely the value we are delivering to the customers is also growing pretty significantly on a forward-looking basis. And so I think all of that will help us do well here.
Operator:
Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.
Jim Friedland:
Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2025 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.
Operator:

Summary
Alphabet
(
GOOGL
+0.65%
)
delivered a milestone quarter, surpassing $100 billion in consolidated revenue for the first time, with the entire business achieving double-digit growth and substantive momentum in AI-enabled products. The Google Cloud segment accelerated, with revenue up 34% and backlog expanding $49 billion sequentially, reflecting robust enterprise AI demand and multiple billion-dollar deal signings. YouTube reached $10.3 billion in advertising revenue, while Shorts profitability exceeded that of traditional formats in the U.S. Alphabet raised full-year CapEx expectations to a $91 billion-$93 billion range, citing sustained technical infrastructure investment. Management directly identified increasing operating costs, particularly from depreciation, energy, and a large European Commission fine, as sources of margin pressure and noted that year-over-year ad growth comparisons in Q4 will be affected by elevated prior election spending.
Pichai highlighted that first-party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute via direct API used by customers.
Management reported more than 300 million paid subscriptions across products, with notable YouTube Premium and Google One momentum.
Ashkenazi confirmed Cloud GCP’s enterprise AI offerings generate “billions in quarterly revenue,” indicating tangible AI monetization.
Philipp Schindler characterized YouTube’s business as powered by a twin engine monetization strategy, combining its advertising business and its growing subscription services. Both YouTube ads and subscription saw strong growth this quarter. Looking at YouTube Music and Premium, users are, on average, delivering more value to creators, to music, media partners and YouTube itself than even ad-supported users. On average, a YouTube Music and Premium subscriber generates a meaningfully higher gross profit than an ad-supported user.
Pichai said, “the number of deals greater than $1 billion that we signed in the first 3 quarters of this year are greater than the 2 years prior.”
Ashkenazi projected a continued “tight demand-supply environment in Q4 and 2026” for Cloud due to rapid infrastructure expansion.
Schindler reported that AI Max, launched globally in September, is “the fastest-growing AI-powered search ads product,” unlocking billions of “net new queries” for advertisers.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Sundar Pichai:
Thank you, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This was a terrific quarter for Alphabet, driven by double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We are seeing AI now driving real business results across the company. We delivered our first ever $100 billion quarter. 5 years ago, our quarterly revenue was at $50 billion. Our revenue number has doubled since then, and we are firmly in the generative AI era. In parallel, we've built for the long term and diversified with successful businesses in cloud, YouTube and subscriptions. Our momentum is strong, and we are shipping at speed.
As just a few examples: our first-party models, like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute via direct API used by our customers. The Gemini app now has over 650 million monthly active users, and queries increased by 3x from Q2. Cloud had another great quarter of accelerating growth with AI revenue as a key driver. Cloud backlog grew 46% quarter-over-quarter to $155 billion. And we crossed $300 million paid subscriptions led by growth in Google One and YouTube Premium. Today, I'll discuss progress in our full stack approach to AI and then share highlights from search, cloud, YouTube and Waymo.
As a reminder, our full stack approach spans AI infrastructure, world-class research including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring AI to people everywhere. First up, AI infrastructure. Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator. We are scaling the most advanced chips in our data centers, including GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA, as well as our own purposeful TPUs. And we are the only company providing a wide range of both. As we announced yesterday at NVIDIA GTC, we are now shipping the new A4X Max instances powered by NVIDIA GB300 to our cloud customers.
Our highly sought-after TPU portfolio is led by our 7-generation TPU, Ironwood, which will be generally available soon. We are investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners, and we are excited that Anthropic recently shared plans to access up to 1 million TPUs. Next world-class AI research, including models and tooling. Our models are world-leading. GEMINI 2.5 Pro, Veo, Genie 3 under viral sensation Nano Banana are among the very best in class. Over 230 million videos have been generated with Veo 3, and more than 13 million developers have built with our generative models. We are looking forward to the release of Gemini 3 later this year.
Our research leadership is advancing next frontier technologies. Last week, we announced that our Willow quantum chip achieved a major breakthrough, running an algorithm 13,000x faster than 1 of the world's best supercomputers, and the result is verifiable, paving the way to future practical applications. Speaking of quantum, let me congratulate Michel Devoret, our Chief Scientist for Quantum Hardware. He received a Nobel in physics for early research he did in the 1980s. Three Nobels awarded to current Googlers in 2 years, incredible. And third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to more people and developers than anyone else. In July, we announced that we processed 980 trillion monthly tokens across all our surfaces.
We are now processing over 1.3 quarterly and monthly tokens, more than 20x growth in a year, phenomenal. This quarter, we took big steps to reimagine Chrome as a browser powered by AI through deep integrations with Gemini and AI Mode in search with more agentic capabilities coming soon. In August at Made by Google, we unveiled our Pixel 10 series of devices. They are the first with our most powerful chip designed to run on Gemini Tensor G5. They're our best reviewed devices ever. And last week, we launched Android XR, our new operating system at Samsung's Galaxy XR device. It brings new ways to use headsets and glasses with Gemini at the core.
Now turning to highlights from Search. AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search. As people learn what they can do with our new AI experiences, they're increasingly coming back to Search more. Search and its AI experiences are built to highlight the web, sending billions of clicks to sites every day. During the Q2 call, we shared that overall queries and commercial queries continue to grow year-over-year. This growth rate increased in Q3, largely driven by our AI investments in Search, most notably AI Overviews and AI Mode. Let me dive into the momentum we are seeing. As we have shared before, AI Overviews drive meaningful query growth.
This effect was even stronger in Q3 as users continue to learn that Google can answer more of their questions, and it's particularly encouraging to see the effect was more pronounced with younger people. We're also seeing that AI Mode is resonating well with users. In the U.S., we have seen strong and consistent week-over-week growth in usage since launch and queries doubled over the quarter. Over the last quarter, we rolled out AI Mode globally across 40 languages in record time. It now has over 75 million daily active users, and we shipped over 100 improvements to the product in Q3, an incredibly fast pace. Most importantly, AI Mode is already driving incremental total query growth for Search.
Philipp will talk more about monetization and share how AI is helping people connect with businesses and shop on Search. Next, Google Cloud. Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins and backlog. In Q3, customer demand strengthened in 3 ways. One, we are signing new customers faster. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger deals. We have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous 2 years combined. Third, we are deepening our relationships. Over 70% of existing Google Cloud customers use our AI products, including Banco BV, Best Buy and FairPrice Group.
As we scale, we are diversifying revenue. Today, 13 product lines are each at an annual run rate over $1 billion. And we are improving operating margin with highly differentiated products built with our own technology. This deep product differentiation starts with our AI infrastructure. We have a decade of experience building AI accelerators and today, offer the widest array of chips. This leadership is winning customers like HCA Healthcare, LG AI Research and Macquarie Bank, and it's why 9 of the top 10 AI labs choose Google Cloud. We are also the only cloud provider offering our own leading generative AI models including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. Adoption is rapidly accelerating.
In Q3, revenue from products built on our generative AI models grew more than 200% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, nearly 150 Google Cloud customers each processed approximately 1 trillion tokens with our models for a wide range of applications. For example, WPP is creating campaigns with up to 70% efficiency gains. Swarovski has increased e-mail open rates by 17% and accelerated campaign localization by 10x. Earlier this month, we launched Gemini Enterprise, the new front door for AI in the workplace, and we are seeing strong adoption for agents built on this platform. Our packaged enterprise agents in Gemini Enterprise are optimized for a variety of domains, are highly differentiated and offer significant out-of-box value to customers.
We have already crossed 2 million subscribers across 700 companies. Next, YouTube. In the living room, YouTube has remained #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, according to Nielsen. Last month marked YouTube's first time as a live NFL broadcaster. This exclusive global broadcast live from Brazil drew more than 19 million fans and set a new record for most concurrent viewers of a live stream on YouTube. YouTube Shorts also continues to perform well. In the U.S., Shorts now earn more revenue per watch hour than traditional in-stream on YouTube.
At our Made on YouTube event, we rolled out a number of AI-powered features that are helping create a supercharged creation and build their businesses. AI is now streamlining the entire content creation workflow from generated video tools and more efficient editing to AI-powered insights that help creators optimize their channels. We are also using AI to expand monetization, automatically identifying products to make their videos more shoppable. Philipp will discuss in more detail. And finally, Waymo, next year Waymo aims to open service in London, and they are working to bring service to Tokyo. They've also announced expansions to Dallas, Nashville, Denver and Seattle and secured permission to operate fully autonomously at San Jose and San Francisco Airports.
Autonomous testing continues to scale in New York City. The new Waymo for Business allows enterprises to offer Waymo as a work travel option. And we launched Waymo teens accounts in Phoenix this summer. We are pleased to see usage steadily increase with positive feedback from teens and their parents alike. Waymo's growth and momentum are strong, and 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting year. Overall, a milestone quarter, the incredible work of our teams is driving momentum across the board and our leadership in AI positions us so well for the opportunity ahead. I want to thank all of our partners and our employees for their hard work and an excellent Q3.
With that, I'll turn it over to Philipp.
Philipp Schindler:
Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $87 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on-year driven by accelerated growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. Adding some further color to our results. The 15% increase in Search and other was led by growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. Its 15% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand.
Starting with Search and other revenues, which delivered over $56 billion in revenue for the quarter. As Sundar mentioned, AI is driving an expansionary moment and transforming how people use Google Search. Our investments in new AI experiences, such as AI Overviews and AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, creating more opportunities for monetization. These AI experiences are enhancing how people connect with businesses and shop on Search. We recently added shopping capabilities in AI Mode, which now help people shop conversationally in Search, and we expanded try-on capabilities to more clothing items, now available to anyone in the U.S.
Lastly, we're making it easier for consumers to benefit from deals through new loyalty offerings like personalized annotations on organic results and ads. Looking at monetization. Businesses can now tap into our most powerful AI search experiences. Using our most advanced AI models, we can understand and predict intent like never before, unlocking entirely new commercial pathways to provide valuable new consumer connections and helping us monetize even more efficiently. Rolled out globally in September, AI Max and Search is already used by hundreds of thousands of advertisers, currently making it the fastest-growing AI-powered search ads product. In Q3 alone, AI Max unlocked billions of net new queries.
By delivering the most relevant ad across surfaces and matching advertisers against additional queries they weren't reaching before, AI Max helps advertisers discover new customers at the exact moment they need their product or service. Kayak, for example, look to grow conversions while staying within their ROAS goals. After turning on AI Max and Search, they grew their conversion value by 12% in early tests. We continue to infuse generative AI capabilities at every step of the marketing process. We rolled out Imagen 4 in Asset Studio and Product Studio, helping businesses produce more and better creatives.
On the measurement front, we enriched the model supporting Meridian, our marketing mix model, with additional variables, and more granular reporting in PMax is making bidding more effective. Financial services company SoFi has been using PMax to meet its ambitious growth targets and help drive a 39% improvement in its conversion volume year-over-year. Moving to YouTube, where we saw accelerated revenue growth. Our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth in our key monetization areas like shorts and living room. As we leverage Gemini models, we're seeing further discovery improvement. On direct response, we're excited about the growth in revenue we're seeing, especially from small and medium advertisers adopting demand gen.
We also improved performance on demand gen with over 100 launches helping to increase conversion value by more than 40% for advertisers using target-based bidding on YouTube. The retail vertical continues to lead our growth on YouTube with demand gen helping us further monetize shopping-related categories. Looking at the living room, our long-term bet, more advertisers are adopting interactive direct response ads, leading to an annual revenue run rate exceeding $1 billion globally for this format. For our viewers, we continue to give fans greater access across sports, while tapping into the best of YouTube's product innovation and creator-led content. Sundar mentioned that we expanded our NFL partnership with our first-ever exclusive global broadcast of an NFL game.
Brands love the opportunity, and we sold all our ad inventory within a couple of weeks. Looking at creators. A significant force behind the thriving YouTube creator economy is the collaboration between creators and brands. Tools like direct linking to deals, websites and shorts and swappable brand segments in long form will soon help creators show how they deliver great value for brands. Thanks to a collaboration with Dude Perfect, Comcast, Xfinity drove an 8% search lift, beating other Xfinity ads, recall lift on shorts by 34%. At the same time, it decreased the cost per lifted user by 50% when compared to the next most efficient ad.
We continue to invest in AI-powered features that are helping creators supercharge creation and build their businesses. with Veo 3 integration and speech to song, creators go from idea to iteration quicker, and new channel insights help them better understand performance. Ending on YouTube with our subscriptions product. We're also seeing momentum with strong growth in offerings such as YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV. We're also applying Gemini internally to help us serve customers with increased speed, intelligence and efficiency. Our sales teams use Gemini enriched with ads knowledge to streamline customer interactions.
This increased productivity by over 10% led to hundreds of millions in incremental revenue and frees up sellers to engage with more customers at a deeper, more strategic level. In our customer support division, Gemini-powered solutions have managed over 40 million customer sessions so far this year and resolved hundreds of thousands of customer inquiries, and we're just getting started. As always, I'll wrap with the progress we're seeing across partnerships where our customers tap into the strength and breadth of Google's products to accelerate their transformation. Revolut, the global financial services company, leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models to help power its advanced customer service chatbot, develop new hyper-personalized financial products and offer predictive insights.
Revolut is also increasing its presence on YouTube adopting Veo 3 for personalized creatives, making Google a key ads partner for delivering growth and launching new markets. In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions to our success and as always, to our customers and partners for their continued trust. And of course, a huge thanks to all of you as we celebrate 25 years of Google Ads. Anat, over to you.
Anat Ashkenazi:
Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. We had an outstanding quarter in Q3, continuing the strong momentum we've had throughout the year, delivering double-digit revenue growth across Search and YouTube advertising, subscriptions, platforms and devices, and Google Cloud. Consolidated revenue reached $102.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase or 15% in constant currency. Total cost of revenue was $41.4 billion, up 13%. TAC was $14.9 billion, up 8%.
Other cost of revenues was $26.5 billion, up 16%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation and other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses increased 28% to $29.7 billion. R&D expenses increased by 22%, driven by compensation, depreciation expenses related to our AI efforts. Sales and marketing expenses were flat, and G&A expenses increased meaningfully, primarily due to the $3.5 billion charge related to the European Commission fine mentioned in the earnings press release. Operating income increased 9% this quarter to $31.2 billion, and operating margin was 30.5%. Excluding the EC fine, operating income increased 22%, and operating margin was 33.9%.
Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, offset by the legal charge and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Other income and expenses was $12.8 billion, primarily due to unrealized gains in our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio. Net income increased 33% to $35 billion, and earnings per share increased 35% to $2.87. We generated free cash flow of $24.5 billion in the third quarter and $73.6 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in Q3 benefited from strong operating cash flow and recent tax changes regarding the timing of when research and development costs are expensed and assets are depreciated. This was partially offset by higher CapEx.
We ended the quarter with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 14% to $87.1 billion, reflecting strength in Google Search, YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 15% to $56.6 billion, representing another robust quarter with continued growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 15% to $10.3 billion driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 3%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues increased 21% this quarter to $12.9 billion, driven by very strong growth in both YouTube and Google One subscriptions.
Google Services operating income increased 9% to $33.5 billion. Operating margin declined year-over-year to 38.5% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base were offset by the impact of the EC fine, which was fully reflected in the Google Services segment. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which again delivered very strong results this quarter as cloud continued to benefit from our enterprise AI optimized stack, including our own custom TPUs and our industry-leading AI models. Cloud revenue increased by 34% to $15.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate.
GCP's growth was driven by enterprise AI products, which are generating billions in quarterly revenue. We had strong growth in enterprise AI infrastructure and enterprise AI solutions, which benefited from demand for our industry-leading models, including Gemini 2.5. Core GCP was also a meaningful contributor to growth. And we had double-digit growth in Workspace, which was driven by an increase in average revenues per seat and the number of seats. Cloud operating income increased by 85% to $3.6 billion, and operating margin increased from 17.1% in the third quarter last year to 23.7% this quarter.
The expansion in Cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes depreciation expense and other operations costs such as energy. Google Cloud's backlog increased 46% sequentially and 82% year-over-year, reaching $155 billion at the end of the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by strong demand for enterprise AI. As Sundar mentioned earlier, Cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in the first 9 months of 2025 than in the past 2 years combined. In Other Bets, revenues were $344 million, and operating loss was $1.4 billion in the third quarter.
Within Other Bets, we continue to allocate more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create substantial value. With respect to CapEx, in the third quarter, our CapEx was $24 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment. In Q3, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchases of stock of $11.5 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion. Turning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on factors that will impact our business performance in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for CapEx for the year.
First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum of our business. At the current spot rates, we could see an FX tailwind to our revenues in Q4. However, the volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q4 revenues. As for our segments, in Google Services, year-over-year comparisons in advertising will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on U.S. elections in the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly on YouTube. In Cloud, demand for our products remains high as evidenced by the accelerating revenue growth and the $49 billion sequential increase in Cloud backlog in Q3.
In GCP, we see strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for Gemini 2.5 and our other AI models, and core GCP infrastructure and other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics. As I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, while we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments and data center construction, we still expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment in Q4 and 2026. Moving to investments. We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from Cloud customers as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company.
We now expect CapEx to be in the range of $91 billion to $93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in the reported CapEx number. Looking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx, and we'll provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I've mentioned on the previous earnings calls, the significant increase in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&L in the form of higher depreciation expenses and related data center operations costs such as energy.
In the third quarter, depreciation increased $1.6 billion year-over-year to $5.6 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 41%. Given the overall increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate slightly in Q4. Second, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season. Q3 was a strong quarter, and we're excited with the adoption of our AI products helped by a rapid pace of innovation and great execution by our teams. This translated into strong momentum in Search, YouTube ads, subscription, platforms and devices in Cloud, resulting in our first $100 billion-plus quarter.
Now Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak:
The first one maybe for Philipp or Sundar. It's on agentic e-commerce and agentic travel. There's a lot of external Wall Street discussion about agentic e-commerce potentially monetizing at a lower rate than search. So the question is what factors are you most focused on to sort of ensure a smooth transition for your search business and for your advertisers as you move over to a more agentic world? And the second one, Sundar, is on Waymo.
How far are we from an integration of Waymo into more of the core Gemini capabilities and the users on the platform taking your user data of where I'm going, what hotel I'm staying at, what airport I'm staying at and having integrated that into Waymo? If you can actually have users use their profiles to pre-schedule Waymos, how far off is that? What do we have to do?
Philipp Schindler:
Brian, great question. This is all early, but we see agentic experiences really as additive to the way people seek information. It helps us answer people's tough questions. It helps us -- it helps people get stuff done, and it helps businesses in the process. And we're working on multiple agentic experiences across key verticals such as travel, commerce, shopping and so on, and we're paying a lot of attention to creating a seamless user experience but also to the fact that we need to integrate different partner ecosystems in a way that it creates value for them.
And by the way, we're also working closely with a lot of our partners on the other side through our cloud services to improve their own agentic experiences. And so maybe we go a little deeper on the shopping side where we actually use AI already very actively to improve the shopping experience. As you know, we launched a more visual experience on AI Mode. That gives people a much more intuitive conversational way to shop. You can simply describe what you're looking for now like the way you talk to a friend, and we'll show you the visual shopping results.
And then we think about building an agentic shopping future and it has to be one, again, that benefits both users and merchants here. And you know that AIO, we also introduced new agentic checkout, which will let shoppers use like agentic AI to buy products from merchant sites and so on. We have a partnership with PayPal to help merchants build agentic commerce experiences. We have a new open protocols for agent-to-agent transactions and so on and so on.
Sundar Pichai:
And Brian, on Waymo, a great question. I was reflecting, I think, on the exact same topic. I'm scheduled to meet with the team to do a review on it in a few weeks out. Look, it is an exciting time. Waymo clearly is scaling up, particularly in 2026. And I think the possibility, as you said, of Gemini, particularly with the multimodal experience as well as services like YouTube, I think there's a real opportunity to make the in-car experience dramatically better. Definitely something we are excited about, and you'll see newer experiences in 2026 for sure.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth:
Philipp, maybe you can just talk more about some of the drivers of the core search strength. And I guess, in particular, when you think about AI Overviews and AI Mode, we know that query growth is accelerating. But can you help us understand from there kind of what happens in terms of clicks per query and conversion rates and pricing in these AI-driven search formats? And then, Anat, can you talk about where you see opportunities in the core cost base as you look to make room to absorb the rapid growth in infrastructure and depreciation going forward?
Philipp Schindler:
So let me give you a bit of vertical color first. In Q3, Search and other revenues again delivered growth across all major verticals, as we said, was from retail and financial services. Health care was also a contributor to the growth here. Our new AI experiences, you mentioned the AI Overviews, AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, really creating more opportunities for monetization. AI Overviews is scaling up and working for our entire user base. We're now scaled to over 2 billion users here, and we're continuing to expand ads in AI Overviews in English to more countries, across desktop, mobile and so on.
And as I've shared before, for AI Overviews, even at our current baseline of ads below and within the AI's response, overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate. So over time, we're excited about the opportunity of richer experiences in AI Mode and AI Overviews to basically open up then the opportunity for also much richer placements. And I think as I've said on a prior call, we manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users and an attractive ROI for advertisers. We don't really manage to paid clicks and CPC targets. But as you will see in the 10-Q, paid clicks were up 7% year-on-year and CPCs were up 7% year-on-year.
Anat Ashkenazi:
Doug, and to your question around where else can we see more opportunity for efficiency and productivity, and I think you heard me say before, this is not a onetime type of effort but rather an ongoing way in which we manage the business, and the key here is that the more we drive productivity across our business, the more we can invest in the business for growth and obviously continue to drive improvement in the P&L.
Some of the areas are things that you've heard us talk about in the past such as moderating the pace of head count growth, optimizing real estate footprint but also as we invest more and more in our technical infrastructure, ensuring that we are optimizing that build-out and the overall technical infrastructure we have that a lot of the data centers, for example, that we build ourselves, so they're optimized and we make sure we do them in the most efficient way. Sundar mentioned on one of the previous calls the productivity associated with leveraging AI for Google.
So this -- the example, the percent of code, now nearly half of all code generated by AI, that's a way for us to leverage AI to drive further productivity across the business. And obviously, we always look at making sure that when we provide services or products that we get the right economics and the right value for what we provide. So the one good example is Shorts, which has a lower revenue share than in stream that helps to improve some of our gross margins. So this is an effort. We have ongoing -- I've mentioned in the past that we have a headwind with depreciation, obviously, increasing alongside our CapEx increase.
So we're -- we have efforts across the organization to ensure we run the business in the most disciplined and productive way while continuing to invest for future growth.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.
Eric Sheridan:
Maybe 2 if I could. Sundar, when you think about your custom silicon efforts across the organization, can you reflect a little bit about the opportunity set you see with each passing generation of custom silicon both in terms of driving operating efficiencies inside the organization and potentially increased monetization efforts around those outside of the organization? Second question would be for Philipp. Obviously, we could see the YouTube advertising revenue number in the reported results. Can you reflect little bit about the scaling of the subscription side of YouTube offerings and how the 2 parts together maybe represent an interesting framework in thinking about the monetization side of YouTube increasingly being a mix of both ads and subscription?
Sundar Pichai:
Eric, overall, I would say, we are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions. It is one of the key drivers of our growth over the past year. And I think on a going-forward basis, I think we continue to see very strong demand, and we are investing to meet that. I do think a big part of what differentiates Google Cloud effectively, we are the -- we have taken a full -- deep full stack approach to AI. So we are -- and that really plays out, right? We are the only hyperscaler who is really building offerings on our own models, and we are also highly differentiated on our own technology.
So to your question, I think that does give us the opportunity to continue driving growth in operating margins in Cloud as we have done in the past. And also, I think from a revenue, sets the infrastructure portion of our business to be a growth driver looking ahead as well.
Philipp Schindler:
And to the second part of your question, look, just taking a quick step back, we often describe YouTube's business as a flywheel. Obviously, it, first of all, starts with the creators, and we have significantly invested here to be the place that YouTube creators really call their home. That's a big piece of it, the #1 piece. Viewers, of course, YouTube has billions of monthly logged-in users and every day, people watch billions of hours of video. And we talked about how our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth and so on and so on.
So on the monetization side, YouTube's business is really powered, I would say, at, let's call it, a twin engine monetization strategy, combining its advertising business and its growing subscription services. Both YouTube ads and subscription saw strong growth this quarter. And so looking at YouTube Music and Premium, users are, on average, delivering more value to creators, to music, media partners and YouTube itself than even ad-supported users do. So in other words, on average, a YouTube Music and Premium subscriber generates a meaningful higher gross profit than they were simply an ad-supported users. Fans come from all over the world.
You know this and this engagement through ads and subscription generates YouTube's revenues and funds what I started with, these creators here and this then drives more viewership and engagement and so on. And that's the flywheel. And so our priority continues like this growth cycle. We're happy with this twin engine monetization strategy.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.
Mark Shmulik:
Sundar, with the strong adoption of Gemini, AI Mode and Overviews across the user base, are there any meaningful differences to call out kind of around the behavior and depth of engagement for those users across the entire Google ecosystem. And then, Philipp, I know we kind of asked this most quarters, but I'm curious kind of what some of the adoption you've seen around AI Overviews and Mode, how you see the economics of search evolving with the higher commercial and total query volume and how it kind of compares against the incremental cost to deliver these results.
Sundar Pichai:
Mark, look, I think obviously, AI Overviews are a natural part of the Google experience, and so engagement is very, very high. I would say AI Mode, you have varied cohorts that are people who are casual users, who are checking it out. And then -- but there's a core group, which really likes AI Mode and is passionate about it, and so you see the early adopters. The product is resonating very strongly, and they are seeking it out. So I think that's how I would highlight the difference.
With Gemini, again, a set of engaged user base who are seeking out the product and so on, but across the board, I think the trajectory has been we are definitely seeing in each of those use cases, a set of early adopters and then more people coming in and the people who are using it continue to use it more over time and report high user satisfaction. So I would say the underlying product metrics are pretty encouraging to see as well.
Philipp Schindler:
Look, into the second part of your question, I think we covered before -- Sundar covered the query development. And as I've just said before, for the AI Overviews, even at our current baseline of ads, right, whether above, below and within the AI response, overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate. And this is a great baseline for further innovation. We talked about this. We're excited about where this can go. And on the AI Mode side, we're testing as an AI Mode, and we'll continue to test and learn before we expand this any further. So that's in combination with what we mentioned about the commercial query overall development.
I think we're in a good place here. You could also argue that on queries, that historically have not been well monetized. We think there is a potential opportunity here where you can obviously imagine that we can build this out with smart AI integration.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.
Michael Nathanson:
I have 2, 1 for Philipp, 1 for Anat. Philipp, it's clear that when people use AI Mode, the query length is much longer. Could you talk about how that longer length may be impacting your ability to drive ROAS and what you're seeing in terms of some of the early -- the benefits of maybe longer query length? And then, Anat, you came to Alphabet from a pharmaceutical company. You've been there more than a year. Can you talk a bit about how you're working to look at ROIC internally? And what early signs are you seeing that gives you confidence that the spending is really driving better returns longer term?
Philipp Schindler:
Look, as Sundar shared, AI Mode now has over like 75 million daily active users in the U.S. and we see a strong and consistent week-over-week growth in usage since launch, and the queries doubled over the quarter. And as I also mentioned, we're testing ads in AI Mode. We'll continue to test before we expand any further. It's really too early to tell and go into any of the details of that testing.
Anat Ashkenazi:
Yes. And the question related to ROIC and how we look at just overall our business and where do we see early signs that are encouraging, so first, I would say it's not just early signs because we're seeing returns, obviously, in the Cloud business. You've heard us talk about the fact that we already are generating billions of dollars from AI in the quarter. But then across the board, we have a rigorous framework and approach by which we evaluate these long-term investments that are meant to do 2 things.
One is to ensure we have -- we built a resilient growth profile for the company, but also that we meet the demand of the customers that we have here in the more near and midterm. So we look at it across the business. We evaluate the potential return for each one of them whether it's in Cloud, and I think that's more visible, obviously, externally given that you see the revenue generated and the fact that we're unable to meet, at this point, customer demand. We have more demand than we have supplied. In our ads business, you see the fact that we're investing to transform search, as you heard from Philipp and Sundar, with AIO and AI Mode.
So we're excited to see what our investments are -- how our investments are helping advertisers as well; YouTube, where it's helping power recommendations. So we're -- when we make a decision on investment in the long term, we go through a very rigorous process of assessing what the return could be and over what time frame we will see that return to give us the high level of confidence to then invest and make those investments for the long term. So it's a very rigorous approach.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Ross Sandler:
Great. About 20% of Google's search queries are commercial historically, and you've talked a bunch on this call about how AI Overviews are kind of expanding the breadth of queries. Could you talk about how new products from the monetization side, like AI Max, are potentially increasing the percent of commercial queries?
Philipp Schindler:
So look, AI Max, and I mentioned this in my call before, improves the ability for advertisers to target a wider range of queries. Separately, there is the question of whether queries actually increase with AI Mode, and Sundar actually talked about it and mentioned the opportunity that he sees here. So I think it's important to separate those 2 things.
And I personally also see this, what I just said in my last remarks, that I think, over time, there's an opportunity to actually take, let's say, queries that are not fully commercial but could have an adjacent commercial relationship to basically expand this into more attractive ads offerings without -- while really creating a really interesting user experience at the same time.
Sundar Pichai:
Yes. And the only thing I would add is just stepping back broadly, I think AI Overviews and AI Mode are dramatically improving search. We can see it in user satisfaction, user quality, all our metrics, and they're universal in the nature. They apply across the universality of human needs. So I think we are seeing it in breadth. And so naturally, over time, that will apply to commercial categories as well.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.
Kenneth Gawrelski:
Two questions, please. First, it appears more and more clear that all the new modes -- Google with Gemini Overview -- AI Overviews, AI Mode, even ChatGPT is growing the addressable market for engagement and search-like behavior. Could you talk about what gives you confidence that it will also grow the addressable market for marketing activity and overall revenue associated with that behavior? That's question one. And question two is just more about as you think about AI Mode, AI Overviews and traditional Google Search, how do you think -- do you see a world in 12 to 24 months, those all will exist? And does the user eventually pick what mode they want?
Is -- does the algorithm pick the mode? Can you talk a little bit about how you think that will progress over the next 12 to 24 months?
Sundar Pichai:
Ken, thanks. Look, I think it's a dynamic moment, and I think we are meeting people in the moment with what they are trying to do. Obviously, search is evolving, and between AI Overviews and AI Mode, I think we are able to kind of give that range of experience for people in this moment. Over time, you will expect us to -- you can expect us to make the experiences simpler in a way that, just like we did universal search many, many years ago, we may have done text search, image search, video search, et cetera, and then we kind of brought it together as universal search.
So you will see evolutions like that, but I think we want to be sensitive to making sure we are meeting the users in terms of what they are looking for. I think Gemini allows us to build a more personal, proactive, powerful AI assistant for that moment. And I think having the 2 surfaces search in Gemini allows us to really serve users across the breadth of their needs. And -- but over time, we will thoughtfully look for opportunities to make the experience better for users.
And to the first part, I would broadly say, as I do think we've been consistently saying for a while now, this is an expansionary moment, and we are seeing people engage more. And I think when they do that, naturally, a portion of that information for users, those journeys are commercial in nature. So I would expect that to play out over time as well.
Operator:
Our last question comes from Justin Post with BAML.
Justin Post:
Great. Just a couple. Sundar, I think you mentioned Gemini 3 is coming. Maybe you can comment on the pace of innovation in frontier models. Is there still just a tremendous amount of innovation? Or is it slowing at all? And then you mentioned a number of large deals signed in the last 9 months for cloud, which is great. Any changes in the economics of these deals as far as long-term profitability? Anything we should be aware of?
Sundar Pichai:
Thanks, Justin. The first on the on the pace of frontier model research and development. Look, I think 2 things are both simultaneously true. I'm incredibly impressed by the pace at which the teams are executing and the pace at which we are improving these models. But it also is true at the same time that each of the prior model you're trying to get better over is now getting more and more capable. So I think both the pace is increasing, but sometimes we are taking the time to put out a notably improved model, so I think -- and that may take slightly longer. But I do think the underlying pace is phenomenal to see.
And I'm excited about our Gemini 3.0 release later this year. On cloud, I would point out as a sign of the momentum, I think the number of deals greater than $1 billion that we signed in the first 3 quarters of this year are greater than the 2 years prior. So we are definitely seeing strong momentum, and we are executing at pace. And in terms of long-term economics, I would say that, again, us being a full stack AI player and the fact that we are developing highly differentiated products on our own technology, I think, will help us drive a good trajectory here as you have seen over the past few years.
Operator:
And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.
James Friedland:
Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2025 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.
Operator:

Summary
Amazon
(
AMZN
+1.25%
)
reported third quarter results with material impacts from special charges related to regulatory settlements and severance. AWS delivered its highest growth in nearly three years, fueled by substantial momentum in AI-related demand, with AWS revenue growing 20.2% year-over-year, and continues aggressive capacity expansion with multibillion-dollar investments in infrastructure and custom silicon. Key AI-driven commerce enhancements, such as Rufus and other generative features, demonstrated substantial customer engagement and incremental sales. The company highlighted strategic advances in core retail operations, including expansion of same-day perishable grocery delivery and the Prime member offering. Significant capital expenditures were allocated to support ongoing AWS infrastructure and supply chain innovation, with cash CapEx expected to increase further in 2026.
Chief Executive Officer Jassy stated, “we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity today, overall in the industry, maybe the bottleneck is power,” signaling no current constraint in key chip supply.
Jassy said, “Trainium3 should preview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the beginning of '26,” referencing expected broadening customer adoption.
Jassy explained Project Rainier's infrastructure scale: “it's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips going to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feat that's hard to do at scale.”
CFO Olsavsky reported, “AWS revenue increased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter,” highlighting sequential growth in the segment.
Olsavsky revealed operating efficiencies, noting, “reduction of U.S. inbound lead time by nearly 4 days compared to last year,” improving working capital management.
Management disclosed that paid units grew 11% year-over-year.
Jassy described the head count reduction as culturally driven, not “really financially driven and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least.”

Full Conference Call Transcript
Dave Fildes:
Hello, and welcome to our Q3 2025 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO; and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated. All comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2024. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, October 30, 2025 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website. You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies and customer demand and spending, including the impact of recessionary fears; inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, restructurings or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.
Andrew Jassy:
Thanks, Dave. We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're reporting $180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, but would have been over $21 billion, if not for 2 special Q3 expenses, $2.5 billion for an FTC settlement and $1.8 billion for estimated severance costs. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $14.8 billion. I'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a relative term.
It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a $132 billion annualized run rate and to have a higher percentage growth rate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our competitors. Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several unannounced new deals in October, which together or more than our total deal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum. Customers want to be running their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger functionality, security and operational performance and the scale I see in front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead. I'll share a little more detail on why.
It starts with AWS having much broader infrastructure functionality. Start-ups, enterprises and governments want to move their production workloads to the place that has the broadest and deepest array of capabilities. AWS has more services and deeper features within those services than anybody else and continues to innovate at a rapid clip. These are key building blocks for anything that customers want to create, and they're a big part of why Gartner has named AWS leader in its strategic cloud platform services Magic Quadrant for 15 consecutive years. We're bringing the same building block approach to AI. SageMaker makes it much simpler for companies to build and deploy their own foundation models.
Bedrock gives customers leading selection of foundation models and superior price performance to deploy inference into their next-generation applications. A lot of the future value companies will get from AI will be in the form of agents. AWS is heavily investing in this area and well positioned to be a leader. Companies will both create their own agents and use agents from other companies. For those building their own, it's been harder to build than it should be. It's why we launched strands to make it much easier to create agents from any foundation model that builders desire.
For companies who successfully built agents, they've hesitated putting them into production because they lack secure scalable runtime services or memory or observability built specifically for agents. It's why we launched AgentCore, a set of infrastructure building blocks that allow builders to deploy secure, scalable agents. Ericsson used AgentCore to deliver AI agents across their workforce, Sony used it to build a agentic AI platform with enterprise-level security, observability and scalability. And Cohere Health is using AgentCore to deploy agents that will reduce medical review times by up to 30% to 40%. AgentCore's SDK has already been downloaded over 1 million times, and our builders are excited about it. It's an enabler.
Companies will also use other agents, and AWS continues to build many of the agents we believe builders will use in the future. For coding, we've recently opened up our agentic coding IDE called Kiro. More than 100,000 developers jumped into Kiro in just the first few days of preview and that number has more than doubled since. It's processed trillions of tokens thus far, weekly actives are growing fast, and developers love its unique spec and tool call and capabilities. For migration and transformation, we offer an agent called Transform. Year-to-date, customers have already used it to save 700,000 hours of manual effort. The equivalent of 335 developer years of work.
For example, Thomson Reuters used it to transform 1.5 million lines of code per month, moving from Windows to open source alternatives and completing tasks or a times faster than with other migration tools. Customers have also already used Transform to analyze nearly 1 billion lines of mainframe code as they move mainframe applications to the cloud. For business customers, we've recently launched QuickSleep to bring a consumer AI-like experience to work, making it easy to find insights, conduct deep research, automate tasks, visualize data and take actions. We've already seen users churn months long projects in today's get 80% plus time savings on complex tasks and realize 90% plus cost savings.
And for contact centers, we offer Amazon Connect which creates a more personalized and efficient experience for contact center agents, managers and their customers. Connect has recently crested $1 billion annualized revenue run rate with 12 billion minutes of customer interactions being handled by AI in the last year and is being used by large enterprises like Capital One, Toyota, American Airlines and Ryanair. These are real practical results for customers, and there are many more examples like them. Because of its advantaged capabilities, security, operational performance and customer focus, AWS continues to earn most of the big enterprise and government transformations to the cloud.
As a result, AWS is where the preponderance of company's data and workloads reside and part of why most companies want to run AI and AWS. To enable customers to do so, we need to have the requisite capacity, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gigawatts of power in the past 12 months, more than any other cloud provider. To put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last quarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of power.
This capacity consists of power, data center and chips, primarily our custom silicon, Trainium and NVIDIA. We've recently brought Project Rainier Online, our massive AI compute cluster spanning multiple U.S. data centers and containing nearly 500,000 of our Trainium2 chips. Anthropic is using it now to build and deploy its industry-leading AI model, Claude, which we expect to be on more than 1 million Trainium2 chips by year-end. Trainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter. Today, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers but we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3.
We're building Bedrock to be the biggest inference engine in the world and in the long run, believe Bedrock could be as big a business for AWS as EC2, and the majority of token usage in Amazon Bedrock is already running on Trainium. We're also continuing to work closely with chip partners like NVIDIA, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel. These are very important partners with whom we expect to keep growing our relationships over time. You're going to see us continue to be very aggressive in investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now, we're monetizing it.
It's still quite early and represents an unusual opportunity for customers in AWS. I'll now turn to stores. Where the team continues to deliver and innovate for customers across our key priorities, selection, low prices and convenience, particularly fast delivery, we're offering 14% more selection since last quarter from popular brands like The North Face and Charlotte Tilbury, and we've added hundreds of thousands of items from popular brands this year. Everyday Essentials continues to grow quickly, and year-to-date is growing nearly twice as fast as the rest of the business.
We continue to make it easier for customers to order low-priced perishable groceries from Amazon, and customers in more than 1,000 cities and towns now can shop fresh groceries alongside millions of Amazon.com products with free same-day delivery. This is a game changer for customers who can now order milk alongside electronics, check out with one cart and have everything delivered to their doorstep within hours. The team also invented a new add to delivery button that lets customers add items to previously scheduled orders and it's been used more than 80 million times since launch, and it's just launch. It's an example of one of those seemingly simple but powerful innovations that make customers' lives easier.
We remain committed to staying sharp on price and meeting or beating prices of other major retailers. In July, we had our biggest Prime Day event ever, with customers saving billions of dollars across more than 35 categories. We continue to break records on speed. We're on track to deliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally once again this year, and we've started rolling out 3-hour delivery in select U.S. cities. We're also continuing to invest in infrastructure to speed up rural deliveries and serve more customers in more communities. That includes committing over $4 billion to expand our rural delivery network across the U.S.
These are small towns where people want fast delivery, but where other companies have been backing out and reducing service. In contrast, we've already increased the number of rural communities with access to our same-day and next-day delivery by 60%, reaching roughly half of the total communities we plan to expand to by the end of the year. The stores team is also innovating rapidly with AI. For example, Rufus, our AI-powered shopping assistant has had 250 million active customers this year with monthly users up 140% year-over-year, interactions up 210% year-over-year and customers using Rufus during a shopping trip being 60% more likely to complete a purchase.
Rufus is on track to deliver over $10 billion in incremental annualized sales. Here are the highlights. Our generative AI-powered audio feature that combines product summaries and reviews to make shopping easier has expanded from hundreds of products at launch to millions of products and millions of customers have used it streaming almost 3 million minutes. In Amazon Lens, an AI-powered visual search tool that lets customers find products with their phones camera, a screenshot or a bar code, now includes Lens Live, which instantly scans products and shows real-time matches in a swipeable carousel. Tens and millions of customers are using Amazon Lens each month. Moving on to Amazon ads.
We're pleased with the continued strong growth, generating $17.6 billion of revenue in the quarter and growing 22% year-over-year. We see strength across our broad portfolio of full photo advertising offerings that helps advertisers reach an average ad-supported audience of more than $300 million in the U.S. alone. We also continue to be excited about our demand side platform, Amazon DSP, which lets advertisers plan, activate and measure full funnel investments. Last quarter, I mentioned our partnership with Roku and we've built on that with a partnership with Netflix, providing advertisers using Amazon DSP with direct access to Netflix's premium ad inventory. We announced integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM.
With Spotify, we provide advertisers with direct programmatic access to a global audience of more than 400 million monthly ad-supported listeners. And with SiriusXM, brands can reach 160 million monthly digital listeners across services like Pandora and SoundCloud and we're excited about the advertising opportunity around prime video live sports. Live sports got a lot of interest from advertisers in upfront negotiations for 2025, '26, and we exceeded our own expectations for upfront commitments with significant growth across the board. Finally, we're continuing to invade for advertisers with AI. For example, in September, we announced an agentic AI tool and creative studio that plans and executes the entire creative process in a matter of hours instead of weeks.
We're also inventing and seeing strong momentum in several other areas, and I'll mention just a few. In Prime Video live sports, NBA on Prime tipped off last week and our opening night doubleheader averaged 1.25 million viewers in the U.S., a double-digit increase over last season on cable. You'll see us bring the same constant innovation here that we brought to our NFL broadcast. We're adding golf with The Masters in 2026 and new skins competition with the PGA Tour on Black Friday this year. And we've added Peacock and FOX One to Prime Videos add-on subscription offering of over 100 channels in the U.S.
We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience, Alexa+ customers are talking to Alexa 2x more. Those interactions are much longer, and they're covering a broader range of topics. So using Alexa+ and Fire TV at 2.5x the rate of classic using natural conversation to discover audio content 4x more, engaging with photos 4x more and customers are completing 4x more shopping conversations that end in a purchase. We've expanded the number of project hyper satellites and space to more than 150 and delivered over 1 gigabit per second speeds and test with our enterprise-grade customer terminal, the first commercial phased array we know of to clear that threshold.
Finally, Zoox robotaxis are available to riders in Las Vegas, and we've announced Washington, D.C. as the eighth testing location. We're excited for these to continue rolling out to more riders. Q4 is one of our busiest and most energizing times of the year, and we're excited about the continued demand for AWS. The innovations will announce the reinvent in December, the positive customer response to our AI-powered experiences, all the guests will be delivering throughout the holiday season and a lot more. Thanks in advance to our teammates around the world who are gearing up to deliver for customers once again. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update.
Brian Olsavsky:
Thanks, Andy. Starting with our top line financial results. Worldwide revenue was $180.2 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, excluding a 90 basis point favorable impact of foreign exchange. In Q3, we reported worldwide operating income of $17.4 billion. This operating income includes 2 special charges, which reduced operating income by $4.3 billion. The first charge of $2.5 billion is related to a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which impacts the North America segment and is recorded in the other operating expense line. The second charge of $1.8 billion relates to severance costs for roll eliminations and impacts all 3 of our segments.
The severance charge is recorded primarily in the technology and infrastructure, sales and marketing and general and administrative expense line items. Excluding these 2 charges, worldwide operating income would have been $21.7 billion or $1.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range. Moving to our segment results. We remain encouraged by the innovation our teams are delivering for customers across all 3 segments. In the North America segment, third quarter revenue was $106.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. International segment revenue was $40.9 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Worldwide paid units grew 11% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize the inputs that matter most to our customers.
In the third quarter, our sharp pricing, broad selection and fast delivery speeds continue to resonate with customers. Customers appreciate the ability to quickly receive items essential for their daily needs, including perishable groceries and have them delivered in the same day. Our millions of global third-party sellers continue to be important contributors to our vast selection, which helps customers find the items they need at competitive prices. We're committed to building innovative services and features for our sellers, including our ongoing advancements in generative AI. Today, more than 1.3 million sellers have used our generative AI capabilities to more quickly launch high-quality listings. Better listings translate into better traction with customers.
And in Q3, worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 62%, up 200 basis points from Q3 of last year. Shifting to profitability. North America segment operating income was $4.8 billion, with an operating margin of 4.5%. Excluding the $2.5 billion charge related to the legal settlement with the FTC, North America segment operating income would have been $7.3 billion with an operating margin of 6.9%. North America segment operating margin also includes a portion of the severance charge. International segment operating income was $1.2 billion, with an operating margin of 2.9%. Excluding the impact of the severance charge International segment operating margins expanded year-over-year.
Globally, our progress on key inputs is delivering a better customer experience while driving a more efficient cost structure. For example, we're making notable strides in improving inventory placement to speed up delivery to customers. And as a result, for the third year in a row, we are on track to deliver our fastest speeds ever for Prime members in 2025. We continue to tune and improve our fulfillment operations and our regionalized network is operating at scale. We see many benefits of our inbound process improvements, including a reduction of U.S. inbound lead time by nearly 4 days compared to last year. This allows us to be more efficient with our inventory purchasing, which benefits working capital.
We're also placing inventory more strategically throughout the network. And by leveraging our existing infrastructure, we're now offering U.S. customers the ability to order perishable groceries and receive them the same day and as little as 5 hours. We're seeing positive early results since launching in January, when customers start shopping groceries on Amazon, they are visiting the site more often and returning twice as often as nonperishable shoppers. Looking ahead, we see further opportunity to improve our activity in our global fulfillment and transportation network. We continue to improve inventory placement to drive down distance travel and touches for package.
We will also build on the gains from our regionalized network through algorithmic improvements as well as launching robotics and automation. Operating margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we have a delivered approach to achieve sustained progress over the long term. Shifting to advertising. Advertising revenue was $17.7 billion and growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter. We continue to see strong growth on an increasingly large base, as our full funnel advertising approach of connecting brands with customers is resonating. Moving next to our AWS segment. Revenue was $33 billion, up 20.2% year-over-year.
This is an acceleration of 270 basis points compared to last quarter, driven by strong growth across both our AI and core services and more capacity, which has come online to support customer demand. AWS revenue increased $2.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and now has an annualized revenue run rate of $132 billion. AWS operating income was $11.4 billion, and reflects our continued growth, coupled with our focus on driving efficiencies across the business. We are expanding our data center footprint, largely to accommodate Gen AI. And to the extent those assets were placed into service related to depreciation does impact our margins.
As we've long said, we expect AWS operating margins to fluctuate over time, driven in part by the level of investments we're making at any point in time. Now turning to our cash CapEx, which was $34.2 billion in Q3. We've now spent $89.9 billion so far this year. This primarily relates to AWS as we invest to support demand for our AI and core services and in custom silicon, like Trainium as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments. We'll continue to make significant investments, especially in AI, as we believe it to be a massive opportunity with the potential for strong returns on invested capital over the long term.
Additionally, we continue to invest in our fulfillment and transportation network to support the growth of the business, improve delivery speeds and lower our cost to serve. These investments will support growth for many years to come. Looking ahead, we expect our full year cash CapEx to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026. I'll finish up my remarks with net income. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, our third quarter net income of $21.2 billion includes a pretax gain of $9.5 billion related to our investment in Anthropic. This investment activity is not related to Amazon's ongoing operations and is included in nonoperating income.
We're encouraged by the start of the peak season and we are ready to serve customers in the coming months. I want to thank our teams across Amazon for their hard work as we get ready to delight customers during the holiday season. Our commitment to elevating the customer experience is the only reliable way to drive sustainable value for our shareholders. With that, let's move on to your questions.
Operator:
[Operator Instructions]
And our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.
Justin Post:
I'll ask on AWS. Can you just kind of go through how you're feeling about your capacity levels and how capacity constrained you are right now? And then in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Trainium3 demand and maybe broadening out your customer base. Can you talk about the demand you're seeing outside of your major customers for Trainium?
Andrew Jassy:
Yes. On the capacity side, we brought in quite a bit of capacity, as I mentioned in my opening comments, 3.8 gigawatts of capacity in the last year with another gigawatt plus coming in the fourth quarter and we expect to double our overall capacity by the end of 2027. So we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity today, overall in the industry, maybe the bottleneck is power. I think at some point, it may move to chips, but we're bringing in quite a bit of capacity. And as fast as we're bringing in right now, we are monetizing it. And then on the Trainium demand, outside of our major customers.
So first of all, as I mentioned on Trainium2, it's really doing well. It's fully subscribed on Trainium2. We have -- it's a multibillion-dollar business at this point. It grew 150% quarter-over-quarter in revenue. And you see really big projects at scale now, like our Project Rainier that we're doing with Anthropic, where they're running their next version of -- they're training the next version of Claude on top of Trainium2 on 500,000 Trainium2 chips going to 1 million Trainium2 chips by the end of the year. As I mentioned, we have -- today, with Trainium2, we have a small number of very large customers on it.
But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price performance than other options out there, and because as customers, as they start to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to being AI-focused and using inference, they badly care about price performance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium. Trainium3 should preview at the end of this year with much fuller volumes coming in the beginning of '26, we have a lot of customers, both very large, and I'll call it, medium-sized who're quite interested in Trainium3.
Operator:
And the next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak:
Congrats on the quarter, guys. So maybe 2. One, Andy, sort of a philosophical chip question. There's a lot of questions in the market about Trainium and sort of its positioning versus other third-party chips. So how do you think about the key hurdles of Trainium3 need to overcome to really make Trainium adoption broader, to your point on the last question and continue to drive Trainium as opposed to satisfying what could be broader demand with third-party chips in the near term?
Andrew Jassy:
Yes. Well, first of all, we're always going to have multiple chip options for our customers. It's been true in every major technology building block or component that we've had in AWS. Really in the history of AWS, it's never just one player that over a long period of time has the entire market segment and then can satisfy everybody's needs on every dimension. And so we have a very deep relationship with NVIDIA. We have for a very long time. And we will for as long as I can foresee the future. We buy a lot of NVIDIA.
We are not constrained in any way in buying NVIDIA, and I expect that we'll continue to buy more NVIDIA both next year and in the future. But we're different from most technology companies in that we have our own very strong chip team, and this is our Annapurna team. And you saw it first on the CPU side with what we built with Graviton which is about 40% better price performance than the other x86 processors, and you're seeing it again on the custom silicon on the AI side with Trainium, which is about the same amount of price performance benefit for customers relative to other GPU options.
And our customers to be able to use AI as expansively as they want. And remember, it's still relatively early days at this point. They're going to need better price performance and they care about it deeply. And so I mentioned earlier the momentum that Trainium2 has. And I think that for us, as we think about Trainium3, I expect Trainium3 will be about 40% better than Trainium2 and Trainium2 is already very advantaged on price performance. So we have to, of course, deliver the chip. We have to deliver it in volumes and deliver it quickly. And we have to continue to work on the software ecosystem, which gets better all the time.
And as we have more proof points like we have with Project Rainier with what Anthropic's doing on Trainium2, it builds increasing credibility for Trainium. And I think customers are very bullish about it. I'm bullish about it as well.
Operator:
And our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth:
I'll stick with basically the same topic, Andy. But can you just talk a little bit about the architecture of Project Rainier and how it's differentiated and what that means for customers and for AWS? And do you expect Rainier to expand beyond Anthropic? And how do you replicate Rainier with Trainium3 chips?
Andrew Jassy:
Yes. I think what is compelling for entropic around Project Rainier is really is the Trainium2 chip, which we built a very -- first of all, we built a very large cluster that they can use in a very expansive way. And it's not simple to be able to build a cluster that has 500,000 plus chips going to 1 million. That's an infrastructure feet that's hard to do at scale. And so some piece of it is the infrastructure capabilities that we've built over a long period of time in AWS that is unusual in the industry. But it's just also the performance of the chip and the price performance, both of which matter.
And I think that Project Rainier is something that is specific for anthropic, but we have a lot of other customers who are interested in employing large clusters of Trainium chips that we're going to hopefully give them a chance to do so with Trainium3.
Operator:
The next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.
Mark Stephen Mahaney:
I want to ask about 2 topics, groceries and then how to think about head count in the future. And on groceries, I want to -- the perishables, I think last quarter, you talked about 70% or something of users had never purchased from perishables from Amazon before. Just talk about whether you -- I think you used the term, Game Changer, before. Does this mean that maybe we don't -- you no longer need to Amazon Fresh stores. You always had this DVD delivery van density advantage.
And have you kind of reached a point you think of scale and speed that you really can change people habit and really have them consider Amazon as one of their first grocery options? Do you really feel like you're at that point? And then secondly, just on the head count, some of the recent news. Just talk to us about how you think about head count going forward? Are you seeing -- is the level of efficiencies that you're getting from AI such that you can keep head count relatively flattish for the foreseeable future? Just talk about the pros and cons or the wins and losses in terms of that head count going forward?
Andrew Jassy:
Yes. So I'll start with grocery, Mark. We have a very large grocery business. If you look at our entire grocery business, if I don't even count Whole Foods Market and Fresh, in the last 12 months to over $100 billion of gross merchandising sales, which would make us a top 3 grocery in the U.S. A good chunk of it is a lot of the items that you'd find in the middle aisle so consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty, very significant and continues to grow at a very good clip.
But then we also have Whole Foods Market, which is the pioneer in organic foods, which is also growing at a faster clip than most grocery companies with an attractive trajectory on profitability, and we'll expand our Whole Foods physical presence over the coming years here. And I'm also very excited about this new concept, daily shop that we have, which is a smaller version of Whole Foods in urban settings, which we have 3 that we've launched that are off to very good starts that you should expect to see more of as well. And we have always been -- as you referenced, we've talked a lot about having a larger mass physical presence.
And we continue to experiment with various formats. But the one that we are most excited about is what you referenced, which is the ability to provide perishable groceries with same-day deliveries. And if you think about how many of our customers are buying from us multiple times a week and who are buying things like shampoo or detergent or paper cups or water, where the ability to add milk and eggs and yogurt and other perishables to their order and have it live in the same shop in cart and then show up a few hours later, is very compelling.
And we started with a few markets about a year ago, and we were really taken aback at the adoption, not just the number of people that started buying perishables from us very quickly but how often they came back downstream to buy perishables and groceries from us in the future. And so we've now expanded that to 1,000 cities around the U.S. and will be in 2,300 by the end of the year. And it's really changing the trajectory and the size of our grocery business. And I also believe that this many years tradition of the weekly stock up grocery stock up is changing. And I think we're a big part of that.
And I think there's a lot of potential there for the grocery side. It doesn't mean that we won't continue to experiment with other physical formats, but we're on to something very significant with what we're doing with perish both from our same-day facilities. And then on your head count question, what I would tell you is the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now, at least. It really -- its culture.
And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers. And when that happens, sometimes without realizing that you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the 2-way door decisions, the ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line, and it can lead to slowing you down.
And as a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest start-up. And that means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly. And I don't know if there's ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business in general with the technology transformation happening right now, where it's important to be lean, it's important to be flat, and it's important to move fast, and that's what we're going to do.
Operator:
And the next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.
Eric Sheridan:
Wanted to know, Andy, if you could reflect on the opportunity that's continuing to present itself in terms of rolling out more robotics and automation and the broader theme of physical AI across your operations? And how should we be thinking about that as a driver of potential efficiencies, but also as a driver of the ability to possibly reinvest back in the business over the long term?
Andrew Jassy:
Robotics is a very substantial area of investment for us. We have over 1 million robots in our fulfillment network at this point. And I would say that while that's significant, we have a lot of invention in flight. So I expect that we'll have more over a period of time. Robotics are very important for us and for our customers and for our teammates because they improve safety, they boost productivity, they increased speed, and they let our human teammates focused on problem solving and what they do best. And we expect that our people remain at the heart in the center of our fulfillment network as they have from when we first started working the robotics.
And we expect that over time, we will have a fulfillment network where robots and humans complement each other and work together. But I think you're going to continue to see us advance invest very significantly in robotics. It's going to help on the safety, the productivity, the speed and ultimately some of the cost pieces, which will allow us to continue to improve the customer experience.
Operator:
And the next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen.
John Blackledge:
How does Amazon think about agentic commerce going forward? And how do you think Amazon will serve customers using agents to purchase goods on Amazon in the future?
Andrew Jassy:
I'm very excited about -- and as a business, we're very excited about in the long term the prospect of agentic commerce. And it has a chance to be good for customers has a chance to be really good for e-commerce. And I think if you're -- if you know what you want to buy, there are a few experiences that are better than coming to Amazon. But if you don't know what you want, it's a physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages. Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time. But you very often want to ask questions and help get help narrowing what you're going to look for.
And as you keep asking new questions, having a whole bunch of different options presented to you. And I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience online where that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you don't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical environments. Now we obviously have our own efforts here in agentic commerce. We have Rufus, which I talked about in my opening comments, which is continuing to get better and better and used more broadly. And we have features like Buy for Me where we will surface on Amazon, even items that we don't stock that other merchants have.
And then if customers want us to go and buy it for them on those merchants websites, we will do that. And both of those have been successful for us. But we're also having conversations with and expect over time to partner with third-party agents. And I think that it reminds me in some ways of the beginning of search engines many years ago being sources of discovery for commerce. And you had to kind of figure out the right way to work together. And today, search engines are a very small part of our referral traffic and third-party agents are a very small subset of that. But I do think that we will find ways to partner.
We have to find a way, though, that makes the customer experience good. Right now, I would say the customer experience is not -- there's no personalization. There's no shopping history. The delivery estimates are frequently wrong. The prices are often wrong. So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and the promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online.
And I think that's really good for customers, and I think it's really good for Amazon because at the end of the day, you're going to buy from the outfit that allows you to have the broadest selection, great value and continues to deliver for you very quickly and reliably. And I think that bodes well for us.
Operator:
And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird.
Colin Sebastian:
I guess first on AWS, following up there. How much of this acceleration is driven by core infrastructure versus AI workload monetization? And I think part of it is trying to understand how important newer services like AgentCore are becoming and bringing enterprises to AWS to build agents? And then I guess, secondly, regarding the acceleration in advertising, if you could potentially disaggregate the core advertising contribution versus DSP and Prime video. That would be helpful as well.
Andrew Jassy:
I'll start on the AWS side, we are seeing -- we're really pleased with the results from this quarter, 20% year-over-year on a annualized run rate of $132 billion is unusual. And we have momentum. You can see it. And we see the growth in both our AI area, where we see it in inference. We see it in training. We see it in the use of our Trainium custom silicon. Bedrock continues to grow really quickly. SageMaker continues to grow quickly. And I think that the number of companies who are working on building agents is very significant. I do believe that a lot of the value that companies will realize over time and AI will come from agents.
And I think that building agents today is still harder than it should be. You need tools to make it easier, which is why we built strands, which is an open source capability that lets people build agents from any model that they can imagine. But even more so, when you talk to enterprises or companies that care a lot about security and scale. They're starting to build agents, and they don't really feel like they've got -- they've had building blocks that allow them to have the type of secure scalable agents that they need to bet their businesses and their customer experience and their data.
And that's why -- that was really the inspiration behind AgentCore was to build another set of primitive building blocks like we built in the early days of AWS, where it was compute and storage and database. We defined a set of building blocks that you needed to be able to deploy agents securely and scalably that we provide in AgentCore. And then when we talk to our customers, it really resonates. There is not anything else like it, it's changing their time frame and their receptivity to building agents, and it's very compelling for them.
So I do think the combination of what we're doing to enable agents to be built and run securely and scalably as well as some of the agents that we're building ourselves that our customers are excited about are compelling for them. And I think the other place we see a lot of growth in AWS also is just the number of enterprises who are -- who have gotten back to moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. And we continue to earn the lion's share of those transformations. And I look at the momentum we have right now, and I believe that we can continue to grow at a clip like this for a while.
I think on the advertising side, that is also an area where I think collectively, we feel very pleased about the progress. Every single one of our advertising offerings this quarter grew in a meaningful way. I think there's a few things going on for us. We have what I think of as a pretty unusual full funnel offering.
And if you look at the top of the funnel, which typically tends to be awareness building and broad scale to be able to use our own Prime Video and our live sports capabilities as well as going all the way down to the bottom of the funnel at point of sale being able to use sponsored products, that's -- most people don't have a full funnel offering as robust as that. And then when you layer on top of it, the combination of the audience curation and development we can do, along with the advantage measurement, it just all leads to a return on advertising spend is very unusual.
And I think there are multiple places where we can expect to continue to grow. One is in our stores business. I still think if you look at the worldwide market segment share of retail, still 80% to 85% of it lives in physical stores. And that equation is going to flip over time. And I think AI is going to only accelerate that. So I think we have an opportunity -- a significant opportunity still in our existing stores. And then I think video, we've only been at this for a little bit of time, but it's already a very large amount of advertising revenue, and we're still relatively early stage.
I think that will continue to be a big area of growth. And then as you referenced, the amount -- their demand-side platform or Amazon DSP, that is growing really quickly as well. And some of it had to do with the fact that we had some features. We always had a number of the core components people wanted around some of our properties, the measurement capabilities, Amazon Marketing Cloud, but we lack some features for a while as we were building out our DSP that customers told us mattered and the team over the last 20 months have closed those gaps in a very significant way so that now people feel like our DSP is fully featured.
And then you look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S. And you layer on top of that, what we've recently done in providing our DSP customers, the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful. And so we are growing very quickly on the demand side platform. So very optimistic about what we're doing there. We've continued work to do, obviously, but I don't think we're close to being able to grow there.

SUMMARY
Meta Platforms
(
META
+5.63%
)
a reported robust double-digit top-line growth in Q3 2025, with notable gains in global user engagement and video monetization year-over-year. Management upgraded forward capital expenditure and expense guidance, citing escalating infrastructure and AI compute requirements as central drivers for 2025 and 2026. Aggressive hiring in technical and AI roles continued, while automation in ads and messaging segments showed expanding adoption and improved advertising efficiency.
but explicitly guided for lower Reality Labs revenue, reflecting product cycle timing and holiday demand shifts.
Reality Labs' growth benefited from retail pre-purchases and AI glasses, with headwinds in Q4 directly linked to product release cycles instead of ongoing demand.
The transition to new US tax regulations resulted in a substantially elevated tax rate, but management expects a 12%-15% tax rate in Q4 and ongoing cash tax savings.
Expansion of Meta's AI-driven Advantage Plus and Lattice model architectures continued to deliver lower costs per lead, improved conversions year-over-year, and further consolidation of ads ranking models, supporting incremental advertising revenue gains.
Management emphasized the likelihood of further upward pressure on expenses as they front-load data center and compute investments ""to be prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" according to Mark Zuckerberg in the AI cycle.
EU regulatory action and upcoming US youth-related legal proceedings were directly highlighted by management as potential sources of significant financial risk.
Mark Zuckerberg underscored the runway for AI improvements, noting persistent demand to ""absorb a very large amount"" of compute for both core business and new AI products, and that continued scaling is central to sustaining future growth.
Management confirmed that on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financing, such as the Blue Owl joint venture, have been designed to provide flexible, long-term infrastructure capacity and will impact capital expenditure recognition going forward.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Mark Zuckerberg:
We had another strong quarter with 3.5 billion people using at least one of our apps every day. Instagram hit a major milestone with 3 billion monthly actives. And we're seeing good momentum across our other apps as well, including Threads, which recently passed 150 million daily actives and remains on track to become the leader in its category. I am very focused on establishing Meta as the leading frontier AI lab. Building personal superintelligence for everyone, delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our approach of advancing open-source AI means that when Meta innovates, everyone benefits. Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a strong start.
I think that we've already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry. We're heads down developing our next generation of models and products. And I'm looking forward to sharing more on that front over the coming months. We're also building what we expect to be an industry-leading amount of compute. Now there's a range of timelines for when people think that we're gonna get superintelligence. Some people think that we'll get there in a few years. Others think it will be five, seven years, or longer. I think that it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load building capacity so that way we're prepared for the most optimistic cases.
That way, if superintelligence arrives sooner, we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift in many large opportunities. If it takes longer, then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business, which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to throw at it. And we're seeing very high demand for additional compute both internally and externally. And in the worst case, we would just slow building new infrastructure for some period while we grow into what we build. The upside is extremely high for both our existing apps and new products and businesses that are becoming possible to build.
Across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, our AI recommendation systems are delivering higher quality and more relevant content, which led to 5% more time spent on Facebook in Q3 and 10% on Threads. Video is a particular bright spot. With video time spent on Instagram up more than 30% since last year. And as video continues to grow across our apps, Reels now has an annual run rate of over $50 billion. Improvements in our recommendation systems will also become even more leveraged as the volume of AI-created content grows. Social media has gone through two eras so far. First was when all content was from friends, family, and accounts that you followed directly.
The second was when we added all of the creator content. Now as AI makes it easier to create and remix content, we're going to add yet another huge corpus of content on top of those. Recommendation systems that understand all this content more deeply and show you the right content to help you achieve your goals are going to be increasingly valuable. Our ads business continues to perform very well largely due to improvements in our AI ranking systems as well. This quarter, we saw meaningful advances from unifying different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency.
And now the annual run rate going through our completely end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. And one way that I think about our company overall is that there are three giant transformers that run Facebook, and ads recommendations. We have a very strong pipeline of lots of ways to improve these models by incorporating new AI advances and capabilities. And at the same time, we are also working on combining these three major AI systems into a single unified AI system that will effectively run our family of apps and business, using increasing intelligence to improve the trillions of recommendations that we'll make for people every day.
I'm also very excited about the new products that we're going to be able to build. More than a billion monthly actives already use Meta AI, and we see usage increase as we improve our underlying models. I'm very excited to get a frontier model into Meta AI. I think that the opportunity there is very large. The same goes for our business AI. Every day, people have more than 1 billion active threads with business accounts across our messaging platforms ranging from product questions to customer support. Our business AIs will enable tens of millions of businesses to scale these conversations and improve their sales at low cost.
And the better our models get, the better this is gonna work for all businesses. This quarter, we also launched Vibes, which is the next generation of our AI creation tools and content experiences. Retention is looking good so far. And its usage keeps growing quickly week over week. I'm looking forward to ramping up the growth of Vibes over the coming months. More broadly, I think that Vibes is an example of a new content type enabled by AI and I think that there are more opportunities to build many more novel types of content ahead as well.
As our new models become ready, I'm looking forward to starting to show everyone some of the new kinds of products that we're working on. At Connect, we announced our 2025 line of AI glasses. The response so far has been great. The new Ray-Ban Meta glasses and Oakley Meta Vanguards are both selling well. The people love the improved battery life, camera resolution, new AI capabilities, and the great design. And there's our new Meta Ray-Ban display glasses, our first glasses with a high-resolution display and the Meta Neural Band to interact with them. They sold out in almost every store within 48 hours, with demo slots fully booked through the end of next month.
So we're gonna have to invest in increasing manufacturing and selling more of those. This is an area where we are clearly leading and have a huge opportunity ahead. Taking a step back, if we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead for our existing apps, and the new experiences that are possible. Then I think that the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history. We've got a lot to do, but we're making real progress delivering strong business results building the talent density and infrastructure needed for the next era, and leading the way on AI devices that will define the next computing platform.
I'm proud of how our teams are rising to the challenge, and I'm grateful for their dedication, hard work, and creativity. As always, thank you all for being a part of this journey with us. And now here's Susan. Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.
Susan Li:
Let's begin with our segment results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Our community across the family of apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.5 billion people use at least one of our family of apps on a daily basis in September. Q3 total family of apps revenue was $50.8 billion, up 26% year over year. Q3 family of apps ad revenue was $50.1 billion, up 26% or 25% on a constant currency basis. Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 14%. Impression growth was healthy across all regions driven by engagement and user growth particularly on video surfaces.
The average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand largely driven by improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of apps other revenue was $690 million, up 59%. Driven by WhatsApp paid messaging revenue growth, as well as Meta verified subscriptions. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q3 revenue was $470 million, up 74% year over year. The significant year-over-year growth in Q3 was partly due to retail partners stocking up on Quest headsets ahead of the holiday season. We did not have a similar benefit in the third quarter of last year since our Quest 3s headset launched in 2024.
Aside from this, strong AI glasses revenue also contributed to revenue growth Q3. Moving now to our consolidated results. Q3 total revenue was $51.2 billion, up 26% or 25% on a constant currency basis. Q3 total expenses were $30.7 billion, up 32% compared to last year. Year-over-year expense growth accelerated 20 percentage points from Q2. Due primarily to three factors. First, legal-related expense growth was higher than in Q2. Due to charges we recorded in the third quarter as well as us lapping a period of accrual reversals in the third quarter a year ago. Second, employee compensation growth accelerated, driven by technical hires, particularly AI talent.
Finally, growth in infrastructure costs accelerated due to increased infrastructure operating costs associated with our expanded data center fleet. Depreciation on our incremental CapEx spend, and third-party cloud spend. We ended Q3 with over 78,400 employees, up 8% year over year. Driven by hiring in priority areas of monetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, Meta Superintelligence Labs, as well as regulation and compliance. Third quarter operating income was $20.5 billion, representing a 40% operating margin. Q3 interest and other income was $1.1 billion driven primarily by unrealized gains on our marketable equity securities.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 87% which was unfavorably impacted by a one-time noncash reduction in deferred tax assets that we no longer anticipate using under new US tax law. Our tax rate would have been 14% excluding this charge. Although the transition to the new US tax law resulted in an accounting charge in the third quarter, we continue to expect we will recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of the current year and future years, under the new law, and this quarter's charge reflects the total expected impact from the transition to the new US tax law. Net income was $2.7 billion or $1.05 per share.
Excluding the one-time tax charge, our net income and EPS would have been $18.6 billion and $7.25 share respectively. Capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases were $19.4 billion, driven by investments in servers data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.6 billion. We repurchased $3.2 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $44.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance. Our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time.
On the first, daily actives continue to grow year over year across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. We're continuing to see improvements to our products and recommendations, drive incremental engagement with year-over-year growth in global time spent accelerating On both Facebook and Instagram in Q3. In The US, overall time spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits year over driven by continued video strength as well as healthy growth in non-video time on Facebook. The engagement gains continue to be driven by product work and ongoing improvements to our recommendation systems, as we optimize our model architectures, implement advanced modeling techniques, and integrate more signals about people's interests. Also continue to focus on increasing the freshness of recommended content.
On Facebook, our systems are now surfacing twice as many reels published that day. At the start of the year. Looking to 2026, we expect to advance our recommendation systems across several dimensions. On Instagram, one focus is evolving our systems to surface content across a broader set of topics that cater to the diverse interests of each person. This follows a similar approach we've implemented on Facebook that has driven good results. We also expect to make significant progress on our longer-term ranking innovations in 2026.
We're seeing promising new results from our research efforts to create foundational ranking models and expect the new model innovations we're developing as part of this will enable us to significantly scale up the amount of data and compute we use to train our recommendation models in 2026. Yielding more relevant recommendations. Another large focus next year is leveraging LLMs to improve content understanding. We expect this is going to enable our systems to more precisely label the keywords and topics within videos and posts, which will allow our systems to both develop deeper intuition about a person's interests and retrieve the content. That matches them. Finally, we're making good progress with Meta AI and Threads.
The number of people using Meta AI across our family of apps continues to grow. And we're increasingly leveraging first-party content into Meta AI results with the majority of Meta AI's responses to Facebook deep dive queries in The US now showing related reels. We're also seeing a lot of traction with media generation. People have created over 20 billion images using our products, And since launching Vibes within Meta AI in September, we've seen media generation in the app increase more than tenfold. On Threads, we see strong growth in both daily actives and the depth of engagement as we continue to improve recommendations.
The ranking optimizations we made in Q3 alone drove a 10% increase in time spent on Threads. We also continue to ship new features, including launching direct message in Q3, so anyone on Threads can now message one another within the app. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance. Increasing monetization efficiency. The first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to refine ad supply across each of our major within Facebook and Instagram to better deliver ads at the time and place they are most relevant to people. Longer term, we have exciting ads supply opportunities on both Threads and WhatsApp status.
Ads are now running globally in feed on Threads, and we're following our typical monetization playbook, of optimizing the ads formats and performance before we ramp supply. Within WhatsApp status, we're continuing to gradually introduce ads. And expect to complete the rollout next year. The second part of increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. Advancing our ad systems remains a critical aspect of this work. And we are driving performance gains through ongoing improvements in our larger scale ads ranking models. For example, we continue to broaden the adoption of Lattice, our unified model architecture. In Q3, we rolled out Lattice to app ads which drove a nearly 3% gain in conversions for that objective.
Since introducing Lattice back in 2023, along with other back-end improvements, we have now cut the number of ads ranking in recommendation models by approximately 100. As we consolidated smaller and more specialized models into larger ones that use the lattice architecture, generalize learnings across surfaces and objectives. We continue to observe performance improvements as we combine models and expect to drive additional gains as we consolidate another 200 models over the coming years, into a smaller number of highly capable models. In addition to advancing our foundational ads models, we're innovating on our runtime models we use downstream of them for ads inference.
For example, we began piloting a new runtime ads ranking model in Q3 that leverages more compute and data than our prior models to select more relevant ads. In testing, we've seen this new model drive a more than 2% lift in conversions on Instagram. We also significantly improved performance of Andromeda in Q3, by combining models across retrieval and early stage ranking into a single model. Driving a 14% increase in ads quality on Facebook surfaces. Within our ads products, we're seeing continued momentum, which Advantage Plus. In Q3, we completed the rollout of our streamlined campaign creation flow for advantage plus lead campaigns.
So now advertisers running sales, app, or lead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning. Allowing our systems to look across our platform to optimize performance by automatically choosing criteria, like who to show the ads to, and where to show them. The annual run rate of revenue running through our end-to-end automated solutions has now reached $60 billion following the implementation of the new streamlined creation flow. As we continue to see more advertisers leverage the performance benefits of our solutions.
Within our advantage plus creative suite, the number of advertisers using at least one of our video generation features was up 20% versus the prior quarter as adoption of image animation and video expansion continues to scale. We've also added more generative AI features to make it easier for advertisers to optimize their ad creatives and drive increased performance. In Q3, we introduced AI-generated music. So advertisers can have music generated for their ad that aligns with the tone and message of the creative. Finally, business messaging remains a significant opportunity for us. We're seeing strong growth across our portfolio of solutions. Including with click to WhatsApp ads. Which grew revenue 60% year over year in Q3.
We're also making good progress on our business AI efforts. We've been focused on building a turnkey AI that helps businesses generate leads and drive sales. We've been opening access in recent months to more businesses within our initial test markets, The Philippines and Mexico, and have seen strong usage with millions of conversations between people and business AIs taking place since July. This month, we expanded availability within WhatsApp and to all eligible businesses in Mexico and The Philippines, respectively. In The US, we're also starting to roll out the ability for merchants to add their business AIs to their website so we can support the full sale funnel from ad to purchase.
Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus is deploying capital to support the company's highest order priorities, including developing leading AI products models and business solutions. As we make significant investments in infrastructure to support this work, we are focused on preserving maximum long-term flexibility to ensure we can meet our future capacity needs while also being able to respond to how the market develops in the years ahead. We're doing so in several ways, including staging data center so we can spring up capacity quickly in future years as we need it, as well as establishing strategic partnerships that give us option value for future compute needs.
The strong financial position cash generation of our business enable us to make these investments while also accessing additional pools of cost-efficient capital. Moving to our financial outlook. We expect fourth quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $56 billion to $59 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to year-over-year total revenue growth. Based on current exchange rates. Our outlook reflects an expectation for continued strong ad revenue growth Partially offset by lower year-over-year Reality Labs revenue in Q4.
The anticipated reduction in Reality Labs revenue is due to us lapping the introduction of QUEST 3s in Q4 of last year, as well as retail partners procuring Quest headsets during Q3 of this year to prepare for the holiday season. Which were recorded as revenue in the third quarter. Turning to the expense and CapEx outlooks. I'll first start with 2025 before providing some commentary on our planning for 2026. We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $116 billion to $118 billion updated from our prior outlook of $114 a $118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 22% to 24% year over year.
We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $70 to $72 billion increased from our prior outlook of $66 to $72 billion. Onto tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2025 tax rate to be 12% to 15%. Turning now to 2026. We are at an exciting point for our company where we have continued runway to improve our core services today as well as the opportunity to build new AI-powered experiences and services that will transform how people engage with our products in the future.
We expect the set of investments we're making within our ads and organic engagement initiatives next year will enable us to continue to deliver strong revenue growth in 2026. While our progress on AI models and products will position us to capitalize on new revenue opportunities in the years to come. A central requirement to realizing these opportunities is infrastructure capacity. As we have begun to plan for next year, become clear that our compute needs have continued to expand meaningfully. Including versus our own expectations last quarter. We are still working through our capacity plans for next year.
But we expect to invest aggressively to meet these needs both by building our own infrastructure and contracting with third-party cloud providers. We anticipate this will provide further upward pressure on our CapEx and expense plans next year. As a result, our current expectation is that CapEx dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025. We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate in 2026 than 2025, with growth primarily driven by infrastructure costs including incremental cloud expenses and depreciation. Employee compensation costs will be the second largest contributor to growth. As we recognize a full year of compensation for employees hired throughout 2025, particularly AI talent.
And add technical talent in priority areas. Finally, we continue to monitor legal and regulatory matters. Including the increasing headwinds in The EU and The US that could significantly impact our business and financial results. For example, the EU, we continue to engage constructively with the European Commission on our less personalized ads offering. However, we cannot rule out the commission imposing further changes to that offering that could have a significant negative impact on our European revenue as early as this quarter. In The US, a number of youth-related trials are scheduled for 2026. And may ultimately result in a material loss. In closing, this was another good quarter for our business.
We have an exciting set of opportunities to continue improving our core business delivering innovative new experiences and services for the people and businesses using our products in the years to come. With that, Christa, let's open up the call for questions.
Krista:
Thank you. We will now open the lines for question and answer session. If you are streaming today's call, please mute your computer speakers. And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Brian Nowak:
Thanks for taking my questions. I have a two for Susan. The first one, Susan, so the pipeline for core improvements to come in '26 with models and ad ranking models and more types of compute, seems very exciting and the infrastructure build seems sizable behind that. So, you help us a little understand some of the early quantifiable signals you're seeing on AB tests from some of these improvements to come that sort of make you most excited and give you confidence you're gonna get ROIC from all this CapEx? That's the first one. Second one is a little faster. How large is the Reality Labs revenue headwind in the 4Q guidance? Thanks.
Susan Li:
Thanks, Brian, for the question. I think your first question had a couple parts to it. So I'm gonna try to disaggregate those parts and let me know if this addresses what you're getting to. I will say that the growth in 2026 CapEx relative to 2025 comes from growth in each of the core areas, MSL, CoreAI, as well as non-AI spend. So all of those areas are growing, but these MSL AI needs are growing the most. In terms of the core AI pipeline, you know, I think we talked about, last year, we were going into the 2025 budget process, we had a road map of resource investments across both headcount and compute.
That we thought would pay off, you know, in 2026. And it's really a very broad range of sort of different ads ranking and performance efforts. And we're continuing to see that, you know, those have paid off through the course of the year. There is a long list of specific efforts, but one of the measures that we look at to monitor this is, you know, how are we driving ad performance, How are conversions growing? Conversions is a complex metric for us because advertisers optimize for so many different conversions. With different values. But when we control for that and look at value-weighted conversion rates, we're seeing very strong year-over-year growth and conversions continue.
Weighted conversions continue to grow faster than impressions. We also talked about some of the new model architecture over the course of the year and the degree to which the new model architecture is enabling us also to take advantage of having more data and more compute to drive ads performance. So we expect that's going to be a continued story in 2026. We are in fact at the beginning of our 2020 budgeting process now, and we, you know, see a similar list of revenue investments. That we you know, that we're excited to be able to invest in.
And so we think that's going to be a big part of our ability to continue to drive strong revenue performance throughout the year. On your second question, which is the Reality Labs revenue headwind. I don't think we have quantified the exact size of that. We expect that Q4 Reality Labs revenue will be lower than last year for a couple reasons that I alluded to. The biggest factor is we're lapping the introduction of Quest 3s in Q4 of last year, and we don't have a new headset in the market this year. We also recorded all of our holiday-related Quest 3s sales in Q4 2024 since the headset was launched in October 2024.
This year, we're recognizing some of those Quest 3s sales in Q3 as retail partners have procured Quest headsets in advance of the holiday season. We're still expecting significant year-over-year growth in AI glasses revenue in Q4 as we benefit from strong demand for the recent products that we've introduced, but that is more than offset by the headwinds to the Quest headsets.
Krista:
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Doug Anmuth:
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the strategy to front-load capacity for superintelligence. Can you just talk about your thought process and kind of triangulating the CapEx dollar growth and the significantly faster expense growth next year with core growth in the business and then the impact on earnings and free cash flow? And do you even do you have targets that we should be thinking about for cash on hand or net cash overall? Thanks.
Susan Li:
Thanks, Doug. We're right now, I would say, in the process of we're relatively early, actually, still in the process of putting together our budget for 2026. And it is on the on the side, a particularly, you know, dynamic process. We're certainly seeing that we wish we had more capacity today than we do. We would be able to put it towards good use. Certain not only with the MSL team, having more capacity, but we'd be able to put it towards good and ROI positive use in the core business as well.
So we're really trying to plan ahead not only to ensure that we have the capacity we need in 2026, but also to give ourselves sort of flexibility and option value to have the capacity that we think we could need in '27 and '28. So that said, you know, there are lots of moving pieces in the budget. It's not baked yet. It's still sort of in the process of coming together. We don't have, you know, specific targets to share.
But we do feel like, you know, our strategic priority is really making sure that we have the compute that we need to be well positioned to succeed at AI, you know, that's that's sort of the foremost priority as we're putting together the budget.
Mark Zuckerberg:
Yeah. I mean, I'll add a few thoughts on this too, although as Susan said, we're still working through the actual budget, and I think we'll typically have more to share on that early next year. But to date, we keep on seeing this pattern where we build some amount of infrastructure to what we think is an aggressive assumption and then we keep on having more demand to be able to use more compute, especially in the core business. In ways that we think would be quite profitable then we end up having compute for.
So I think that suggests that being able to make a significant larger investment here is very likely to be a profitable thing over some period. Because if the primary use of it is going to be to accelerate the AI research and the new AI work that we're doing and how that relates to both the core business and new products. But any compute that we don't need for that, we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to absorb a very large amount of that to just convert into more intelligence and better recommendations in our family of apps and ads in a profitable way. Now, I mean, it's, of course, possible to overshoot that.
And if we do, I mean, this is what I mentioned in comments, then you know, we see that there's just a lot of demand for other new things that we build internally, externally, like, almost every week. People come to us from outside the company asking us to, you know, stand up an API service or asking if we have different compute that they could get from us and we haven't done that yet. But, obviously, if you got to a point where you overbuilt, you could have that as an option.
And then you know, the kind of the very worst case would be that we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years, in which case, of course, there would be some loss and depreciation. But we'd grow into that and use it over time.
So my view on this is that rather than continuing to be constrained on CapEx and feeling in the core business like, we have significant investments that we could make that we're not able to make, that would be profitable, the right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the that we need both for the AI research and new things that we're doing and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business. So kind of how I'm thinking about that overall. Of course, there's a lot of operational constraints too on what one can build. Right?
So we're basically trying to work through this all, and I think we'll have more to share in the coming months and over the course of next year. But I think that there's just a huge, huge amount of opportunities ahead here.
Krista:
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Eric Sheridan:
Thanks so much for taking the question. Mark, wanted to reflect on some of your comments with respect to scaling towards superintelligence and bringing it back to consumer AI. Maybe reflect a little bit the signals you've gotten on the way consumers across family of apps interact with Meta AI today and how you think about scaling and exiting models from the superintelligence effort might change the utility and behavior around Meta AI in the years ahead? Thanks.
Mark Zuckerberg:
Yeah. I mean, a lot of people use Meta AI today. I mean, as I said in my comments upfront, more than a billion people who use it on a monthly basis. And what we see is that as we improve the quality of the model, primarily for post-training LAMA four at this point, we continue to see improvements in usage. So our view is that when we get the new models that we're building in MSL, in there and get, like, truly frontier models novel capabilities that you don't have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity. Right?
We know mean, I would guess that you know, Meta I think, has the best track record of any company out there of taking a new product that people love and getting it to billions of people in terms of usage. So I think that the ability to plug in leading models is going to I would predict lead to a very large amount of use of these things over the coming years. So I'm very excited about that in terms of new products. It's not just Meta AI as an I think that there are gonna be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we're starting to see that with video and content creation.
But I think that there's gonna be a lot more like that I'm quite excited about. And then there are the business versions of all these too, like business AI. And then know, that's, of course, one part of the story is the new things that will be possible to build. Then the other part, is how more intelligent models are just gonna improve the core business. And improve the recommendations that we make across the family of apps and improve the recommendations in advertising. And I think there's just a as we've shown, there's sort of this very large amount of headroom and the opportunity there keeps growing as we as we are improving and optimizing the AI there.
And I think that really shows no sign of being near the end. I think that there's quite a bit more to do there. And know, like I said, in response to the last question, we are sort of perennially operating the family of apps and ads business in a compute starved state at this point, which is, on the one hand, sort of an odd thing to say given the compute that we've built up. But we really are, you know, taking a lot of the resources and using them to advance future things that we're doing.
And we think that there's a lot more compute that we could put towards these that would just unlock a huge amount of opportunity in the core business as well.
Krista:
Your question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Mark Shmulik:
Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Susan, as you about the visibility into kind of the runway next year of continued ad performance and engagement improvements, How do you think about kind of the scale of those improvements versus kind of the progress we've seen over the last two years? And then, as you think about kind of the timing of some of these newer efforts coming out of Superintelligence Labs, is that anchoring to kind of an updated Frontier model on sometime next year, like, the right way for us to think about it? Or should we be looking at kind of progress from new products you're excited to see ship like Vibes? Thank you.
Susan Li:
Thanks, Mark. So on the sort of ads improvement side, you know, some of the innovations that we have been launching actually involve sort of improving our larger scale models. So we, you know, don't use our larger model architectures like JEM for inference, because their size and complexity would make it too cost prohibitive. The way that we drive performance from those models by using them to transfer knowledge to smaller lightweight models that are used at runtime. And then in addition to the foundation model work, we are working on advancing our inference models by developing new techniques and architectures that then allow us to scale up compute and complexity. An ROI positive way.
So, in general, you know, we obviously have a very large base of advertisers. There's a lot of demand liquidity, in the system. And even, you know, small scale improvements that we are able to make in terms of driving, you know, basis point improvements in the performance of ads or single digit, you know, increases in conversions relative to impressions in a given quarter, you know, off of a large base mean that we're really able to continue to grow the absolute dollars of revenue growth in a pretty meaningful way.
Krista:
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Justin Post:
Actually, you.
Mark Zuckerberg:
Hey, Justin. Just give us one second. I think there was a second question that we would just wanna get to on MSL. Yeah. I mean, I'll keep it quick. I mean, I don't think we have any specific timing to announce certainly on the models or products, but I expect that you will see both. We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I'm excited to share more when we have it.
Krista:
Krista, Justin, please go ahead.
Justin Post:
Great. Thanks. So, Mark, you mentioned the prior two concepts. Cycles and obviously you've been able to generate very attractive margins on them. As we get into the AI cycle, obviously some concerns on the investment, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about tools that could be coming out for users? I know there's some new competition And then secondly, how you think about margins in this context cycle? Any reason to think they would be different versus prior cycles? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg:
I think it's too early to really understand what the margin are gonna be for the for the new products that we build. I mean, I think certainly every each product has somewhat different characteristics, and I think we'll kind of understand how that goes over time. Mean, my general goal is to build a business that maximizes value for the people who use our products and maximizes profit not margin. So I think we'll kind of just try to build the best things that we can and to deliver the most value that we can for most people.
Krista:
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ross Sandler:
Great. Hey, Mark. Some of the goals for competing AI labs are around achieving AGI or these other milestones that are kind of, like, out there and a little esoteric. How are you setting up your new team in terms of achieving those types of goals versus products that can generate revenue from Meta kinda right out of the gate. And is the goal that you had articulated to us previously around giving billions of people kind of a personal AI to use the still the direction of travel that you see, or is there you know, other things like kind of this vibe or Sora angle that, you know, you think are potentially important?
How should we think about, like, the overall direction? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg:
Sure. So the way that I think about this is that the research is going to enable new technological capabilities to exist. And then those capabilities can get built into all kinds of different products. So the ability to reason more intelligently is for example, very important across a large number of things. It would be useful for an assistant. It will also be useful in business AI. It will also be useful in the AI agent that we're building to help advertisers figure out what their campaigns are gonna be. It will also have implications for eventually how we do ranking and recommendations of people's feeds and make different decisions there. That's just one example.
I mean, certainly, the capability to be able to produce very high-quality good video is going to be useful for giving people new creative tools, It will help increase the amount of content inventory that can be shown in Instagram and Facebook, and therefore, should enable an increase in engagement there. It should help advertisers be able to create creative that will help us monetize better. So you can just go kind of down the list of capabilities that you'd expect.
I think each one will enable a bunch of different things, and I think the art of product development here is looking at the list of technology capabilities and figuring out what new products are gonna be useful and prioritizing those. But fundamentally, I would sort of expect this exponential curve in new technology capabilities are gonna become available. And the other thing that I expect is that I think being the best a given area will drive great returns rather than this is not like a check the box exercise of, like, okay. Can generate some kind of content and someone else can.
I think that, like, the company that is the best at each of these capabilities, think, will get a large amount of the potential value for doing that. So are lots of different capabilities to build. I'm not sure that any one company is gonna be the best at all of them. I doubt that's gonna be the case. But a lot of what we're trying to do is not like not kind of do some things that others have done. We're really trying to build novel capabilities, and I'm this high level because I'm not don't wanna necessarily, from a competitive or strategic perspective, get into what we're prioritizing.
But that hopefully gives you a sense of how we're thinking about what we're doing. We wanna be able to kind of build novel things, build them into a lot of our products, and then have the compute to scale them to billions of people. And we think that's gonna both show up in terms of new products keep being possible, and new businesses. And very significant improvements to the current business too.
Krista:
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Mark Mahaney:
Thanks. Can I just ask just a question on Meta AI and both product and the monetization path? So when you look at it, what you've seen that's most encouraging to you in terms of the adoption and the use of Meta AI? And then when you think about I know you generally like to roll out and then, you know, deepen engagement and then later think about monetization. Like, where do you think you are on that path now? Is it clear to you what the monetization options are? For Meta AI? You very much.
Mark Zuckerberg:
I mean, I think the most promising thing that we're seeing is one that we were able to build something that a large number of people use and I think that's valuable. Then secondly, that as we there is a clear correlation as we improve the models in ways that we think make them better. That people use them more. So that shows that we have a runway to basically be able to improve engagement and turn this into a product that's leading over time.
In terms of where we are on this, and we basically just did this huge effort to boot up Meta Superintelligence Labs and build what I am very proud of is, I think, the highest talent density lab in the industry at this point. There were a lot of really great researchers and infrastructure folks and data folks who are now a part of this effort, are who are focused on training the next generation of work and doing some really novel work. And when that is ready, I think that we will be able to plug that into a number of products that we're building, and I think that will be very exciting.
But I think that's really the next thing that we're looking at. And then from there, I think that these models will also improve monetization in all of the different ways that we've talked about so far in terms of improving engagement, improving advertising, helping advertisers engage.
I mean, there's the one opportunity that we just we usually talk about on these calls, but hasn't come up as much here is just the ability to make it so that advertisers are increasingly just gonna be able to give us a business objective and give us a credit card or bank account and like, have the AI system basically figure out everything else that's necessary, including generating video or different types of creative that might resonate with people that are personalized in different ways. Finding who the right customers are. All of the capabilities that we're building, I think, go towards improving all of these different things. So quite optimistic about that.
Krista:
Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.
Ronald Josey:
Great. Thanks for taking the question. This maybe dovetails perfectly off Mark, what you just talked about. And we heard a lot about end-to-end automation here, I think, reaching a $60 billion ARR wanted to hear about if you can talk to us more just about adoption rates amongst the and then maybe bigger picture, as you incorporate ranking recommendation changes like Andromeda or GEMS or Lattice, So talk to us how this automation is driving, call it, a higher ROI for advertisers overall as we bring it all together. Thank you.
Susan Li:
Yeah. So we've been sort of laying the continued brick by brick build of Advantage Plus and extending the of objectives that it applies to over time. And so in Q3, we completed the global rollout of the streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage Plus lead campaigns. So now advertisers who are running sales app or lead campaigns have end-to-end automation turned on from the beginning. And, like, you know, the kind of application of the streamlined campaign creation flow for other objectives, this generally allows advertisers to optimize, and automate several aspects of the campaign setup process at once.
That includes things like audience selection, where to show the ad, how the budget gets paced and distributed across ad sets to drive the most efficient outcomes. And, you know, we see that Advantage Plus continues to drive performance gains. Advertisers who run lead campaigns using Advantage Plus are seeing a 14% lower cost per lead, on average than those who are not. And I would say that we think that there is still a lot of opportunity generally to grow adoption of Advantage Plus. A lot of advertisers only use our end-to-end automated solutions for a portion of their campaigns so we can grow share there.
And to capture that opportunity, we're focused on driving continued performance improvements and addressing some of the key use cases that we still need in order to grow adoption. We're also working to broaden adoption among advertisers who use one of our single-step automated solutions For example, advertisers who might only use a piece of it, like Advantage Plus Audiences, by helping them understand, the benefits of using more than one automated solution, at this the same time. So I would say, Advantage Plus is sort of ongoing platform by which we both continue to expand the feature set that is available in Advantage Plus.
And then expand the extensibility or the coverage of that feature set to the sort of the broader set of advertisers. You know, I think Mark, mentioned that the annual revenue run rate now for advertisers who are using these automated options is, you know, $60 billion. And, we see that there's room to continue growing that.
Krista:
Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Youssef Squali:
Great. Thank you very much. Mark, on wearables in particular, do you think you'll be able to sell enough hardware to recoup your investment, or is that dependent on maybe creating new avenues for revenue from things like advertising services and commerce through that new computing platform? And if so, what are kind of the gating factors there? And then, Susan, how do you see the on-balance sheet versus off-balance sheet financing on of your AI initiatives? You've recently struck a deal with Blue Owl. The Louisiana data center. Is that part of the CapEx guide for '26? And if it's not, how significant will that weigh a funding be for Meta going forward?
And basically, would that slow down your CapEx growth past 2026? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg:
Can talk about wearables, then and Susan can jump in on the other part. So I know there are a few pieces here. One is that the work that on Ray-Ban Meta and the Oakley Meta product is going very well. I think yeah, I mean, at some point, if these continue going as well as it has been, then I think it will be a very profitable investment. I think that there's some revenue that we get from basically selling the devices. And then some that will come from additional services and from the AI on top of it.
So I think that there's a big opportunity Certainly, the investment here is not just to kind of build a just the device. It's also to build these services on top. Right now, a lot of people get the devices. For a range of things that don't even include the AI, though they like the AI. But I think over time, the AI is going to become the main thing that people are using them for, and I think that's gonna end up having a big business opportunity by itself.
But, you know, as products like the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Metas are growing, We're also gonna keep on investing in things like the more full field of view product form of the Orion prototype that we showed at Connect last year. So those things are obviously earlier in their curve towards getting to being a sustaining business. And our general view is that we wanna build these out to reach many hundreds of millions or billions of people. And the point at which we think that this is gonna be just an extremely profitable business.
Susan Li:
Youssef, to your second question, so the JV that we announced with BlueOwl is sort of an example of finding a solution that enabled us to partner with external capital providers to co-develop data centers in a way that gives us long-term optionality. Supporting our future capacity needs just given both the magnitude, but also uncertainty of what the capacity outlook in years looks like. In terms of how that is recognized as CapEx, our prior CapEx reflected a portion of the data center build cost prior to the joint venture being established. Going forward, the construction cost of the data center will not be recorded in CapEx as the data center is constructed.
We will contribute 20% of the remaining construction costs required, which is line with our ownership stake, and those will be recorded as other investing cash flows.
Krista:
Your last question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Ken Gawrelski:
Thank you. Just one for me, please. Mark, as you think about with the hopefully a leading frontier model next year in hand, could you talk about where you think the value will accrue in this evolving ecosystem will be with the platforms Or do you think that this will be mostly the value will accrue to the scaled first-party applications? Thank you.
Mark Zuckerberg:
I guess I'm not exactly sure what you mean by platform versus application in this context. But I mean, I think that I mean, I think there's just a lot of value to create. With AI overall. So, I mean, clearly, you're seeing the people who are making the hardware, I mean, NVIDIA is doing an amazing job. Right? I think extremely well-deserved success. The cloud partners and companies are doing very well. I think that will likely continue. I think there's a huge opportunity there. But if you look at it today, the companies that are building apps, I mean, a lot of the apps are still relatively small. And I think that's obviously gonna be a huge opportunity.
And I think what we've seen overall is basically people take individual technology advances, and build them into products that then build either communities or other kinds of network effect and then end up being very sustaining businesses. And I think what we haven't really seen as much in the history of the technology industry is the rate of new capabilities being introduced. Because around each of these capabilities, you can build many new products that I think each will turn into interesting businesses. So yes, I don't know. I mean, I'm generally pretty optimistic about there being a very large opportunity.
But in terms of new things to build, think being able to build them and then scale them to billions of people is a huge muscle that Meta has developed, and I think we do very well. And I certainly think that's gonna deliver a huge amount of value.
Both in the core business for all the ways that we talked about, how it's gonna improve recommendations and the quality of the services as well as unifying the models together and so that way, when these systems are deciding what to show, they can just pull from a wider pool And that we've these are things that we've just seen over the you know, twenty plus years of running the company that they just deliver consistent wins, and we're gonna keep on being able to make the systems more general and smarter and make better recommendations for people and have a larger pool of inventory. And that is all gonna be great.
There's gonna be a lot of new things that I think we're gonna be able to take and scale to billions of people over time and build new businesses, whether that's advertising or commerce supported or people paying for it or different kinds of things. So yeah, it's I think it's pretty early, but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business. That's giving us a lot of confidence that we should be investing a lot more. And we wanna make sure that we're not under investing.
Kenneth Dorell:

RISKS
Vaibhav Taneja stated, ""The first among those changes is the repeal of the IRA EV credit of $7,500 by the end of this quarter."" This limits near-term US vehicle supply and may impact delivery guarantees for late-quarter orders in Q2 2025.
Vaibhav Taneja disclosed that tariff costs increased by about $300 million sequentially, with roughly two-thirds of the impact in automotive and less in energy for Q2 2025.
Regulatory credit sales are set to decline as zero-emission penalties are eliminated, which will quickly impact total revenues (as discussed on the Q2 2025 earnings call).
Vaibhav Taneja noted that federal budget legislation has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year.
TAKEAWAYS

Automotive Revenue Growth
: Automotive revenue rose 19% sequentially on a 14% increase in deliveries, primarily due to improved average selling prices (“ASPs”) from new Model Y sales and a favorable mix, despite a reduction in regulatory credit revenue.
Tariffs Impact
: Tariff costs increased by approximately $300 million sequentially, with two-thirds impacting the automotive segment and further increases anticipated in subsequent quarters due to manufacturing and sales cycle latency.
Automotive Product Portfolio
: Production of lower-cost models began as planned in the first half; The ramp will occur in Q3 2025 and proceed more slowly than initially expected due to the focus on maximizing deliveries before the EV credit expires.
Energy Business Performance
: The company achieved record power deployment in Q2 2025, with sequential improvement in energy and solar margins, and attained the highest gross profit for the segment to date.
Energy Business Tariff and Legislative Headwinds
: Despite headwinds from tariffs and early expiration of consumer credits, customers -- especially in industrial storage -- have been willing to absorb some tariff impacts.
Operating Expenses
: Operating expenses grew sequentially on higher R&D investment in AI, greater stock-based compensation, and depreciation from AI compute infrastructure, with expectations for continued growth in these areas.
Free Cash Flow
: Free cash flow was $146 million, as increased operating cash flows were offset by higher capital expenditures.
CapEx Outlook
: Management expects capital expenditures to exceed $9 billion for 2025.
Regulatory Credit Revenue Decline
: A legislative change eliminating emission penalties is expected to reduce new regulatory credit revenue quickly, per DevOps Ninja.
Optimus Production Timeline
: Elon Musk projected prototypes of the Optimus three humanoid robot within three months and planned start of production early next year, with a medium-confidence target of ramping to about 100,000 units per month within five years.
Dojo and AI Infrastructure
: Musk said Dojo two will be operating at scale sometime next year, with scale being somewhere around a hundred k h one hundred equivalent, and a new AI factory will hopefully be in production around the end of next year.
Supercharging and Service Profitability
: Supercharging, insurance, and service centers all contributed to sequential margin improvement in service and other businesses.
Bitcoin-Linked Volatility
: A $284 million mark-to-market gain from Redcom Holdings drove sequential growth in other income, after a $125 million loss in the prior quarter; such swings are attributed to Bitcoin price volatility.
FSD Safety Report
: Management highlighted the newly published vehicle safety report showing that cars on FSD are “statistically safer” than those without, with management citing a ten times safer statistic.
SUMMARY
Tesla
reported major operational milestones in Q2 2025, notably the commercial rollout and geographic expansion of its robotaxi service in Austin, and set aggressive targets for reaching half the US population by year-end. Significant sequential gains in automotive revenue and margin were attributed to higher ASPs, an improved product mix, and increased FSD adoption rates, while The impact of tariffs and expiring EV credits is expected to pressure future US deliveries and regulatory credit revenue in the near term. The energy business achieved record power deployment and its highest gross profit to date, registering customer willingness to bear tariff headwinds, especially in industrial storage, even as legislative changes are set to negatively affect residential storage demand.
Vaibhav Taneja described artificial intelligence and autonomy as by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla, Inc. and emphasized the acceleration of FSD adoption since version twelve’s release.
Prototype Optimus three robots are projected within three months, with mass production slated to begin early next year and scalability to 100,000 units per month over five years as a target for Optimus robot production is considered a “reasonable aspiration,” according to Musk.
Ashok Elluswamy confirmed that all new vehicles delivered from North American factories can autonomously drive from the assembly line to the loading docks, with customer–direct autonomous delivery envisioned in select geographies by year-end.
Musk projected that robotaxi economics could reach sub-thirty cent per mile potential over time. especially for purpose-built vehicles such as the CyberCab, and stated, next year, but confidently next year, people would be able to add or subtract their car to the Tesla, Inc. fleet.
Management confirmed Dojo two supercomputer and a new AI factory are both targeted for production by the end of next year, expanding Tesla, Inc.’s real-world AI capabilities.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Elon Musk:
Thanks, Travis. So we have had a very exciting quarter. We were able to successfully launch a robotaxi, providing our first drives with no one in the driver's seat, with paying customers in Austin. As some may have noted, we have already expanded our service area in Austin. It's bigger and longer, and it's going to get even bigger and longer. We are expecting to greatly increase the service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing, hopefully in a week or two. We are getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and a number of other places.
As we get the approvals and prove out safety, we will be launching the autonomous ride-hailing across most of the country. I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the US by the end of the year. That's at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals. I think we will technically be able to do it. Assuming we have regulatory approvals, it's probably addressing half the population of the US by the end of the year. We are being very cautious. We do not want to take any chances, so we are going to go cautiously. But the service areas and the number of vehicles in operation will increase at a hyper-exponential rate.
Some other notable things: Model Y in June became the best-selling car in Turkey, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria. It is, I believe, the best-selling car of any kind in the world still. Autonomy is a big factor there. Even with just supervised self-driving, it's a huge selling point. It's worth noting that we do not actually yet have approval for supervised FSD in Europe. We think our sales in Europe will improve significantly once we are able to give customers the same experience that they have in the US. This is a very important point to convey. We have been working with the Netherlands, and I think we are close to getting approval there.
Then it's got to go to the EU. It's quite Kafkaesque. But we will get the approvals. I think some people in Europe will have the experience that some have in the US, hopefully at least partially in this quarter. We also have some regulatory challenges in China, which we are hoping to unblock shortly. We cannot provide the service there currently. Within the US, as we are confident about safety in different geographic areas, we will loosen up on how much someone has to be laser-focused on the road. That's a common complaint.
It does create an odd safety issue where people will disengage Autopilot, then do something like change the radio or look at their phone, drive with their knee, and then reengage Autopilot, which is less safe than simply keeping Autopilot on. That experience will improve in the next several weeks. The production release of Autopilot is actually several months behind what people experience on a robotaxi in Austin. Now that we have the robotaxi in Austin launched, we will be adding back those elements so that there will be a step-change improvement in the Autopilot experience for people outside of Austin. As you can tell, autonomy is the story. We need the physical product without which you cannot have autonomy.
But once you have a physical product, the autonomy is what amplifies the value to stratospheric levels. We launched the Tesla Diner, which has been a huge hit. It got worldwide attention, which is unusual for a diner. This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it's worth visiting. It's a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape. Really quite a lovely experience. Great job by the team there. On the full self-driving front, we continue to make significant improvements just with the software. We are expecting to increase the parameter count to what we think can probably tenfold the parameter count.
This is a tricky thing to do because as you increase the parameter count, you get to choke on memory bandwidth. But we currently think we can tenfold the parameter count from what people are currently experiencing. So there's still a lot of improvement on the existing hardware to happen. Energy is growing really well despite headwinds from tariffs and supply chain challenges. We have upgrades to the Megapack that would make it even better. We had record power deployment in Q2. I think battery demand is gigantic. The US sustained power output for the US grid is around one terawatt, but average usage is less than half a terawatt.
If you add batteries to the mix, you can run the power plants 24/7 at full capacity, thus doubling the energy output per year of the United States. That's a big deal. Optimus, we are evolving the Optimus design and getting it to the point where it is a phenomenal design. We are on Optimus version two right now, sort of two and a half. Optimus three is an exquisite design in my opinion. As I have said many times before, it will be the biggest product ever. It's a very hard problem to solve. You have to design every part of it from physics first principles. There's nothing off the shelf that actually works.
We have to train Optimus to use its sensors with a neural net. We will be applying the same techniques we apply for a car, which is essentially a four-wheeled robot. Optimus is a robot with arms and legs. The same principles that apply to optimizing AI inference of the car apply to Optimus because they are both robots in different forms. Tesla is by far the best in the world at real-world AI. A clear proof point for that would be if you compare it to Waymo. Waymo's car is best with god knows how many sensors. Isn't Google good at AI? Yes. But they are not good at real-world AI. Tesla is much better than Google. By far.
Tesla has the best inference efficiency. A key figure for AI is the intelligence per gigabyte. People talk about parameters, but we should talk about gigabytes because with parameters, you can have four-bit parameters, eight-bit parameters, sixteen-bit parameters. The actual constraints in the hardware are how many gigabytes of RAM and how many gigabytes per second can you transfer from RAM. Therefore, it is not a parameter constraint. It is a byte constraint. Tesla has the highest intelligence density of any AI by far. I have a lot of insight into this with XAI. XAI's Grok is the smartest AI overall, but it's a giant beast. Tesla has the best intelligence density.
Intelligence density will be a big deal in the future. With Optimus three, which is really the right design, there's no significant flaws with the Optimus three design. We are going to retool a bunch of things. There will probably be prototypes of Optimus three by the end of this year, and then scale production next year. We will scale Optimus production as fast as possible and try to get to a million units a year as quickly as possible. We think we can get there in less than five years. That's a reasonable aspiration. In conclusion, so far 2025 has been an exciting year. A lot of major milestones.
Made clear product demonstrable progress in autonomy that a lot of the experts said we would not achieve. We have done what we said we were going to do. We are not always on time, but we get it done. Great progress by the Tesla team. I do think if Tesla continues to execute well with vehicle autonomy and humanoid robot autonomy, it will be the most valuable company in the world. A lot of execution between here and there. It doesn't just happen. Provided we execute very well, I think Tesla has a shot at being the most valuable company in the world. Obviously, I am extremely optimistic about the future of the company.
The best way to predict the future is to make it happen. We are making it happen here with the team. I would just like to say thanks to all of our supporters, and I think we are good for an incredibly exciting future.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thanks very much, Elon. DevOps Ninja has some great remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja:
Travis, as Elon mentioned, Q2 was an interesting quarter in a few respects. We started ramping up the production of the new Model Y at all our factories. We rolled out our robotaxi service in Austin and delivered a car completely autonomously from the factory to the customer's home. It is a seminal point to get to this stage. It took a lot of effort, and I really want to thank everybody at Tesla, Inc. for making this happen. It wasn't an easy thing to do, but we did it. It took time, but we have just begun the next phase for the company.
The one big bill has a lot of changes that would affect our business in the near term. The first among those changes is the repeal of the IRA EV credit of $7,500 by the end of this quarter. Given the abrupt change, we have limited supply of vehicles in the US this quarter. As we are already within lead times to order parts for cars, we have rolled out all our planned incentives already and will start pairing them back as we start to sell.
If you are in the US and looking to buy a car, let's roll now as we may not be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed in the later part of August and beyond. The bill also made changes to certain emission standards by reducing the amount of penalty to zero. This, in turn, will have an impact on the new sales of renewal credits to other OEMs and in turn will lead to lower RMBs. While we have not planned our business around such sales, it will impact our total revenues quite fast. On the automotive product portfolio, the entire lineup is updated. Globally, we are seeing an increase in the number of test drives.
We started the production of the lower-cost model as planned in the first half of 2025. However, given our focus on building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in reverse, before the EV credit expires and the additional complexity of ramping a new product, the ramp will happen next quarter slower than initially expected. One thing which is grossly underappreciated, as Elon mentioned, is that all our vehicles in the lineup are capable of autonomy. This is by far the biggest differentiator between us and the competition. Our vehicles top safety standards as is, but with FSD, they are and will continue to set a new standard for safety within regular transportation.
We published a vehicle safety report earlier today. You can see a car on FSD is statistically safer than a car not on FSD. We have started seeing an uptick in FSD adoption in North America in recent months, which is a very promising trend. Just to give you perspective, since we moved to version twelve of FSD, we have seen the adoption rates really increase. On the automotive revenue front, despite the reduction in regulatory credit revenue, the total automotive revenue increased by 19% sequentially even though total deliveries only improved 14%. This was primarily due to improved ASPs because of the new Model Y.
This helped in improving margin sequentially as well, along with improved mix and higher fixed cost absorption, despite an increase in cost of tariffs. We have started seeing the impact of tariffs in our P&L. Sequentially, the cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in automotive and less in energy. However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters. So costs will increase in the near term. While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.
The margins for the energy generation and solar businesses improved sequentially while deployment reduced primarily due to the ramp of power deployments at high margins. We were able to achieve our highest gross profit for the business yet. Note that the overall deployments will continue to vary quarter to quarter. Industrial storage will make a difference in this drive towards AI and data center growth. The energy requirements are increasing at a rapid scale as AI applications are very energy hungry. The quickest path to scale up energy is to deploy storage.
This is something that our customers have started realizing, and despite this business having the largest impacts from tariffs, we are seeing customers willing to accept some of the tariff impacts. The big bill has certain adverse impacts even for the energy business, most notably on the residential storage business due to the early expiration of consumer credits by the end of this year. The challenges of the storage business definitely made both from the wealth and from tariffs, and we are doing our best to try and manage through this. But we will see shifts in demand and profitability.
The margins for our service and other businesses improved sequentially, primarily due to higher profits from supercharging and improvement in insurance and service center profitability. Operating expenses also grew sequentially as we continued our investment in AI projects, including additional expenses related to employee-related costs, including higher stock-based compensation and depreciation for AI compute. Our operating expenses, especially R&D-related spend, will continue to grow. We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy to keep making investments in these areas to position us for the long term. Other income grew sequentially primarily from the mark-to-market adjustment on Redcom Holdings, which was a $284 million gain in Q2, while we got a $125 million loss in Q1.
Just want to remind people that this would keep creating volatility based on the Bitcoin price. While operating cash flows increased sequentially, so did our CapEx, resulting in $146 million of free cash flow. We continue to make investments in various aspects of that fashion, like Cybertruck, semi lines, and other infrastructure spend and the expansion of our AI initiatives. Our latest expectation for the year in terms of CapEx is in excess of $9 billion. To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to the negative impacts of the bill and tariffs. However, the investments that we have made for AI, robotics, and our lead in energy set us up for a bright future.
I would like to thank the whole Tesla, Inc. team, our customers, our investors, and supporters for their continued belief in us.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thanks very much, DevOps Ninja. So now we're going to move on to Say.com questions. The first question is, can you give us some insight into how robotaxis have been performing so far? And what rate do you expect to expand in terms of vehicles, geofence, cities, and supervisors?
Ashok Elluswamy:
Robotaxis have been going great so far in Austin. Customers really love the experience. It's super smooth, very safe, and just a great experience overall. We already did a first phase of expansion in Austin, and we will continue to expand in Austin to probably more than tenfold our current operating region. We are also testing in a lot of other cities as Elon mentioned. The next is the San Francisco Bay Area. We are working with the government to get approval here, and meanwhile, we will launch the service with a person in the driver's seat just to expedite while we wait for regulatory approval.
We are also testing in a lot of other cities in the US, including Florida, Nevada, etc.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you very much, Ashok. The next question is, what are the key technical and regulatory hurdles still remaining for unsupervised FSD to be available for personal use? Can you provide a timeline?
Elon Musk:
We are getting there. I think it will be available for unsupervised personal use by the end of this year in certain geographies. We are just being very careful about it. This is not something we should rush.
Vaibhav Taneja:
No. We want to make sure that everything is safe before we make it available broadly. We are just being extremely paranoid.
Elon Musk:
But I am confident that by this year, within a number of cities in the US, it will be available to end users. And for what I suppose is the same hardware in the Austin robotaxi vehicles as those in customer vehicles, they deliver a car autonomously from the factory to a customer. Yes. And every Tesla, Inc. manufactured in the US and in Europe, autonomously drives itself from the end of the line to the loading docks. It's just a software update.
Ashok Elluswamy:
Yeah. I think we will end up delivering cars in the Great Western area and the Bay Area by default from the factory by the end of this year. A good car will deliver itself to where you are unless you say you do not want that.
Travis Axelrod:
That would be super cool. Great. Thank you, guys. The next question is, what specific factory tasks is Optimus currently performing, and what is the expected timeline for scaling production to enable external sales? How does Tesla, Inc. envision Optimus contributing to revenue in the next two to three years?
Elon Musk:
The Optimus three design, as I mentioned earlier, is finally the right design. There are further optimizations, but no fundamental changes are needed for the Optimus three design. It has all the degrees of freedom that you really want or need. We will have prototypes of that in about three months, and it's subtooling in production. We will start production on that at the beginning of next year. The production ramp is simple. It's not going to predict the S-curve of your production ramp. When something has an entire new design, the rate of production will move as fast as the least lucky and least competent element of the entire supply chain as well as internal processes.
The more new stuff that is in a product, the slower the ramp could be because of unexpected supply chain interruptions or mistakes made internally. It's much easier to predict the end of the S-curve or late in the S-curve than the beginning of the S-curve. The beginning of the S-curve of the production ramp is not really material for revenue purposes. The beginning of the S-curve, when you're usually not usually always negative gross margin and you're debugging a lot of issues. That's why I feel fairly confident in predicting things. At least medium confident in predicting where we are at five years, but it's hard to predict where we are in a year or two years.
That's why I think in five years, we could be at the limit. I would be surprised if at the end of five years, sixty months from now, if we are not roughly making a hundred thousand Optimus robots a month in sixty months. I would be shocked.
Travis Axelrod:
Alright. Thank you very much. The next question is, can you provide an update on the development and production timeline for Tesla, Inc.'s more affordable models? How will these models balance cost reduction, profitability, and what impact do you expect on demand in the current economic climate?
Elon Musk:
Well, I think DevOps Ninja did a good job of answering this question in the opening remarks. As we said, we started production in June, and we're ramping. We probably built some things throughout the quarter, and given that we started in North America and that our goal is to maximize production with higher rates by the end of Q3, we're going to keep pushing hard on our current models to avoid complexity. Then, fortunately, that rolls away. We'll be running with the more affordable models available for everyone in Q4.
The goal with those products was not to negatively impact revenue or gross margin, but just to make a car that everyone loves and wants at a more affordable price.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you, Lars. The next question is, can you talk about the benefits of Tesla, Inc. investing in XAI?
Vaibhav Taneja:
This is not the forum to discuss this topic. If there is something we need to discuss, we'll discuss that separately.
Elon Musk:
I think, obviously, you know, we are a publicly traded company. Shareholders are welcome to put forward any shareholder proposals that they'd like. I've recently encouraged that. And then have shareholders vote and act in accordance with the shareholder wishes.
Lars Moravy:
Great. Thank you very much. The next question is, can you tell us a little bit more about what goes on in the Tesla, Inc. design studio?
Vaibhav Taneja:
Do you want me to take that one?
Travis Axelrod:
We generally say that what happens in the studio stays in the studio, and that earnings calls are not the place to disclose new product stuff. But we're working to ensure that we have an exciting future for Tesla, Inc. and our product lineup.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design studio. It's not static. Really, what's going to happen over the next several years is a fundamental transformation of the company. From a pre-autonomy world to a post-autonomy world. I'm working on a new master plan to articulate that as a team. There will be some teething pains as you transition from a pre-autonomy to a post-autonomy world. But I think the future vision for Tesla, Inc. is incredibly exciting and will profoundly change the world in a good way.
It sounds like sort of pineapple or whatever, but I think if we execute on that plan effectively, which we have to actually do, Tesla, Inc. will be the most valuable company in the world by far.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you. The next question is actually a duplicate on unsupervised FSD customer vehicles, so we'll skip that. And after that is, are there any news for hardware three users getting retrofits or upgrades? Will they get hardware four or some future version of hardware five?
Vaibhav Taneja:
What we want to do is get unsupervised done on hardware four first. Once it's done, then we'll go back and look at what we need to do with the hardware three cars. Like I said, the focus is first to get unsupervised out and then we'll go back and see what more work we need to do.
Lars Moravy:
Great.
Travis Axelrod:
Next question is, can you give an update on Dojo? Could XAI be a customer for Dojo?
Elon Musk:
Dojo two, we expect to have Dojo two operating at scale sometime next year. With scale being somewhere around a hundred k h one hundred equivalent. And then AI five, which is really spectacular too. I don't use those words lightly. The AI factory will hopefully be in production around the end of next year. But that has a lot of potential. Thinking about Dojo three and the AI six in first chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there.
Where it's basically the same chip that is used where you say two of them in a car or Optimus and maybe a larger number on a board account of five twelve on a board or something like that, if you want high bandwidth communication between the chips. That's sort of seems like intuitively the sensible way to go.
Lars Moravy:
Great.
Travis Axelrod:
The next set of questions have all actually been covered. So we'll end with, how will the BBB elimination of tax credits for solar projects affect your sales pipeline for Megapack?
Lars Moravy:
Our sales pipeline is quite diversified across customers and market segments. So we aren't heavily weighted in Megapack projects that are paired with solar. As we talked about in the opening remarks, we're seeing storage quickly being recognized for its ability to unlock grid efficiency and how quickly it can be deployed to help the grid. Although the recent bill was not favorable towards solar, we believe solar projects will still get built because the energy is necessary. The projects are well developed, and they're ready for execution. There's really no alternatives in the near term given gas turbine lead times and pricing.
We also continue to see growth in the data center segment and in standalone storage projects providing capacity to the grid in several markets across the US. Overall, we're forecasting a very strong second half of the year as we increase deployments. Lastly, we continue to invest heavily in US manufacturing to mitigate policy and tariff impacts, expecting our first LFP cell manufacturing facility to be online by the end of the year and launching our third mega factory near Houston in 2026.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you, Mike. We will now be moving to analyst questions. The first question comes from Emmanuel Rosner at Wolfe Research. Emmanuel, please feel free to unmute yourself whenever you're ready.
Emmanuel Rosner:
Great. Thank you so much. Can you hear me?
Lars Moravy:
Yep.
Emmanuel Rosner:
Thanks. So, Elon, are you able to share any KPIs with us in terms of the robotaxi business? How many vehicles are you operating, miles driven autonomously? The number of safety-critical interventions. Just curious, you know, how the rollout is generally going and any sort of targets that you could share more broadly?
Elon Musk:
Sure. Do you want to?
Ashok Elluswamy:
We have more than seven thousand miles operating in the Austin area. Just because the service is new, we have a handful of vehicles right now, but we are trying to expand the service in terms of the area and also the number of vehicles both in Austin and other locations. So far, there are no notable safety-critical interventions. Sometimes we have our own restrictions, for example, restricting our speed limit to forty miles per hour. If the vehicle wants to go on higher speed roads, we can stop the vehicle, but those are more of convenience issues as opposed to safety-critical nature. So for the service, it's really well received, and we continue to expand on it.
Emmanuel Rosner:
Great. And longer term, from an economics point of view, you've previously talked about working to drive down the cost per mile on the robotaxis, maybe towards thirty or forty cents per mile over time. Now that your service is live, how should we think about the main milestones to getting there?
Elon Musk:
The CyberCab is really optimized for autonomy. That has probably sub-thirty cent per mile potential over time. Twenty-five. If you design a car from scratch to be a cost-optimized robotaxi like CyberCab, for example, we're not trying to make it corner incredibly well like a Model 3 would, or Model S or even Model Y. All of our cars that are driven by people are super fun to drive. They've got incredible acceleration, incredible cornering capability. But I think we're confident that very few people in a CyberCab want to be hurtling around. So we reduced the top-end speed, which means we can use more efficient tires. We don't need as much acceleration. We don't need as much big brakes.
We want stopping distance, but we're not expecting it to be heavily used. It's a gentle ride. If you design it for a gentle ride, you have a much more optimized design point. That's why it seems we could achieve that. Especially with Optimus serving, cleaning up the car, and doing maintenance. It's being automatically charged. The actual cost per mile of CyberCab will be very low. The cost per mile of our existing fleet will be higher, but still very competitive. I guess a number of fifty cents. I'm just guessing. Tesla, Inc.'s robotaxi business is gigantic in terms of operations in a pretty short period of time.
My guess is it has a material impact on our financials around the end of next year.
Travis Axelrod:
Thank you very much. The next question comes from Adam at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please unmute yourself.
Adam Jonas:
Great. Hello, everybody. So, Elon, as Tesla, Inc. moves into this next phase of physical AI, autonomous humanoids, robotaxis, etcetera, world-changing, civilizational species-changing technology with dual purpose, are you comfortable moving Tesla, Inc. in this direction while only having a thirteen percent stake in the company? Is that sustainable? Or do you still insist that something needs to happen, given your current lack of control and the types of technologies you're getting into?
Elon Musk:
Yeah. That is a major concern for me, as I've mentioned in the past. I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting. But, yeah, it is a big deal. I want to find that I've got so little control that I can easily be ousted by activist shareholders after having built this army of humanoid robots. I think my control over Tesla, Inc. should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can't be thrown out if I go crazy.
Adam Jonas:
Okay, Elon. You're not gonna go crazy. We trust you.
Emmanuel Rosner:
Well, you can stay a little crazy. A little crazy is okay.
Adam Jonas:
Elon, though, we understand the board of directors of a major US investment bank recently toured Optimus production. I don't know if you want to confirm that or not. It's just what we heard. That's cool. When do you think others will be able to get a firsthand view of Optimus like that? And is the second half of this year too soon to have an AI day? Because it seems like everybody else in the world's doing it, and this talent war is getting freaking crazy. I know you've mentioned for recruiting purposes, this is a very important thing that you've done.
I think people have copied you on this, and I'm wondering if this year's too early for that. Thanks, Elon.
Elon Musk:
Yes. It's a bit of a tough thing because when we're doing AI day, we find that some of our vendors literally do a frame-by-frame examination of our slides, everything we say, and then copy those. So, you know, I'm saying, like, what's the trade-off, which does help with recruiting? But then competitors look very closely and copy us. That said, we should probably consider the shareholder meeting to be sort of an AI day. We can maybe go into some amount of depth at the annual shareholder meeting. With respect to Optimus and AI and sort of our chip stuff perhaps.
Lars Moravy:
Yeah. Tesla, Inc. is really underrated in terms of actual design as well as AI software. There's still not a chip that exists that we would prefer to put in our car over our own. Even though it's been now up for several years. We're confident that the AI and fire chip will be a profound game-changer. In fact, it's so powerful. We'll have to nerf it to some degree for pockets outside of the US because it blows very past the export restrictions. Unless the export restrictions change, we actually will have to nerf our AI live shows. It looks kind of weird. Hopefully, we keep raising the bar on export restrictions. Otherwise, it gets a bit silly.
We'll have a bunch of Optimus robots on stage at the shareholder meeting. The Optimus lab is cool to see. It looks like the set of Westworld. You could see robots in various stages. Some of them in various stages of repair. It's some combination of the Tatooine junkyard and Westworld is what it looks like. It's very cool. Optimus is walking around the office here in Palo Alto. It's just walking around like a small thing. We saw the full Optimus in the Tesla Diner serving popcorn. We'll go from a world where robots are rare to where they're so common that you don't even look up.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you so much. The next question comes from Edison at Deutsche Bank. Edison, please unmute yourself. Please go ahead and unmute yourself. Right. While Edison figures that out, we will go to the next question, which is gonna come from Dan Levy at Barclays. Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Dan Levy:
Great. Thank you. Elon, you've talked about the opportunity to put non-Tesla, Inc. owned vehicles into the robotaxi network. Just talk about the gating factors to enabling that and what timeline we should expect on personally owned vehicles in the robotaxi network?
Elon Musk:
We haven't really thought hard about that. We need to make sure it works when the vehicles are fully under our control. It's kind of one step at a time here. We don't want to jump the gun. As I said, we're being paranoid about safety. But I guess next year is I'd say confidently next year. I'm not sure when next year, but confidently next year, people would be able to add or subtract their car to the Tesla, Inc. fleet.
Vaibhav Taneja:
One thing to keep in mind is that we will have some criteria. Even when you put your car in an Uber or Lyft fleet, they go through a whole checklist process of making sure things are working.
Elon Musk:
Second, Airbnb rules. Yes. Got it. So we will do something like that. Kind of very possible. Yes.
Vaibhav Taneja:
We want, like Elon said, we want to be paranoid about security. Small things like tread on the tire can have an impact on safety. That's why we would want to do some proper validation before we let other cars come in.
Travis Axelrod:
Dan, do you have a follow-up?
Dan Levy:
Yes. Thank you. Could you just unpack the different costs associated with scaling the robotaxi business and how you think about funding those costs? Are the cash flows in the auto business sufficient to fund it? And if not, what other funding sources do you think you'd use? Would you just fund it off the balance sheet?
Elon Musk:
As soon as there is a clear cash flow stream associated with any product, you can finance it.
Vaibhav Taneja:
In the interim, we will use our balance sheet, but once we get to a certain scale in terms of current revenues, like Elon said, we could get into an easily kind of transaction to try and get funding.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thanks so much. We will now move on to Mark from Goldman Sachs. Mark, please feel free to unmute yourself.
Mark Delaney:
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the questions. With the FSD trials that Tesla, Inc. has been offering to consumers and the attention on self-driving more generally, are you able to comment more specifically on what you're seeing with FSD subscription trends and take rates and help us better understand how large FSD revenue may be currently?
Vaibhav Taneja:
We've definitely seen a marked improvement in the FSD adoption since we've launched version twelve of FSD in North America. The other thing we did last year is we brought down the pricing and made the subscription much more affordable. We have seen a 45% increase since that time, which is an encouraging trend. But honestly, we've just started the story around explaining the benefits of FSD. We released our vehicle safety report. Even if you don't believe in anything else, a car on FSD being ten times safer should be a motivator. Plus, people don't realize even at $99 a month, it's like you're getting a personal chauffeur for almost $3.33 a day.
This is by far the biggest game-changer, which I know we've been talking about it because part of it is we live and breathe it.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. I feel like most people still don't know. The vast majority of people don't know it exists. It's still like half of Tesla, Inc. owners who could use it haven't tried it even once. They don't actually go live on it. Obviously, this is something we want to educate them on. When they come in for service, we'll reach out to them, send them videos of how to make it work. It's such a shocking thing. They don't think a car is capable of this. You have to show them and get them comfortable turning it on.
It's so trivial, but it's like saying you've got a cat that can sing and dance, but it just looks like an old cat. Until you see the cat sing and dance and talk, you see it was just a cat. That's Tesla, Inc. FSD. Our car is intelligent.
Vaibhav Taneja:
So what we're gonna do to Elon's point, we've been giving both free time to try and try the FSD, but we'll start giving more prompts to say, okay, this particular drive, try FSD. Because it's literally seeing is believing. Like Elon said, it's like a cat. It looks like a normal cat, but this cat can sing and dance. Same thing on as we build.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. And that 25% comment was a 25% increase in the penetration since we've seen the release of FSD twelve and B thirty-eight in North America. Great. Mark, did you have a follow-up question?
Mark Delaney:
Yeah. Thanks, Travis. Tesla, Inc. has historically said it would use pricing as one tool to help drive auto vehicle growth as long as free cash flow stayed positive given the ability to monetize products like FSD. I'm curious how you're thinking about pricing from here as a potential tool to drive increased volumes, given where you stand with FSD as well as the fact that the IRA purchase tax credits are poised to go away in the US starting in the fourth quarter. Do we expect more meaningful price reductions given that monetization potential? Or do you envision price reductions being more limited compared to cost down given where free cash flow now stands? Thanks.
Elon Musk:
Well, we're in this weird transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US. Slab incentives actually in many other parts of the world. But we'll lose them in the US. Across all of it at the relatively early stages of autonomy. On the other hand, autonomy is most advanced and most available from a regulatory standpoint in the US. Does that mean we could have a few rough quarters? Yeah. We probably could have a few rough quarters. I'm not saying that we will, but we could. Q4, Q1, maybe Q2.
But once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, only by the end of next year, I'd be surprised if Tesla, Inc.'s economics are not very compelling.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. The next question is gonna come from Will from Truist. Will, please feel free to unmute yourself when you're ready.
Will Stein:
Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. First, I'd like to ask for a little bit more detail about the lower-cost model that you talked about having started production in the first half, but you said will ramp later. At the last analyst day, as I recall, you talked about some aspects of this, like two-thirds or three-quarters reduction in silicon carbide and not using rare earths in the motor and perhaps other cost downs. You also had this unboxed architecture that I think you said would not be part of this sort of interim approach. Can you update us on what we should expect this thing to actually look like?
Vaibhav Taneja:
We're not going to get into the look. You're gonna watch the Model Y.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. Let me just lick the car on the back there. Dancing cat. They can certainly dance pretty good. We can talk and see now, so that's the cool part.
Will Stein:
Yeah. I mean, fundamentally, the biggest obstacle remains that people just don't have some of the people don't want. The desire to buy the car is very high, just people don't have enough money in the bank account to buy it. Literally, that is the issue. Not a lack of desire, but a lack of ability. The more affordable we can make the car, the better. I think it won't be a very big deal when people can release their car to the fleet and have it earn money for them. Which, like I said, I'm thinking I feel confident in saying that'll happen next year in the US, at least. In the US, where we're legally allowed, appropriate disclaimers.
That'll make the affordability dramatically greater. Just like, you know, if you have an Airbnb and you rent out your home when you're not there or rent out a guest room or guest house or something like that, the affordability of your home is much greater.
Will Stein:
Okay. Trying another topic then. We see all these wonderful developments at XAI like Grok, and obviously, Tesla, Inc. is trying to do quite a bit in AI. Elon, how do you manage the division of efforts and recruiting and talent and capital between these two that seem like there's a very high potential that they can, in fact, compete?
Elon Musk:
Well, they are doing different things here. XAI is doing terabyte-scale models and multi-terabyte scale models. Tesla, Inc. is a hundred times smaller models. One's real-world AI and one's kind of artificial superintelligence type of thing. The genesis for XAI was there were certain people who simply would not join Tesla, Inc. AI engineers because they wanted to work on ASI. They would join Tesla, Inc. I was like, well, maybe they'll join a new company. I think the total problem is extremely important, but not everyone agrees with me on that. Rather than have them join OpenAI or Google or some other company, I might as well have them a company in that regard. People can make a decision.
Do they want to work on superintelligence at a data center or real-world AI? They're both compelling problems, but some people want to work on one, some want to work on the other.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have today. Thank you, everyone, so much for your questions, and we will see you next quarter."

Full Conference Call Transcript
Elon Musk:
Thank you. We are at a critical inflection point for Tesla.
Travis Axelrod:
And our strategy going forward as we bring AI into the real world. I think it's important to emphasize that Tesla really is the leader in real-world AI. No one can do what we can do with real-world AI. I have pretty good insight into AI in general. I think that Tesla has the highest intelligence density of any AI out there in the car. And that is only going to get better. We are really just at the beginning of scaling at a quite massive level, full self-driving and robotaxi, and fundamentally changing the nature of transport. I think people just do not quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off.
It's honestly going to be like a shock wave.
Elon Musk:
So it's because the cars are all out there. We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars. We are making a couple of million a year. In fact, with the advent of what we see now as clarity on achieving full self-driving, unsupervised full self-driving, I should say, I feel confident in expanding Tesla's production. So that is our intent, to expand as quickly as we can our future production. I was ready to do that until we had clarity on achieving unsupervised full self-driving. But at this point, I feel like we've got clarity, and it makes sense to expand production as fast as we reasonably can.
We are also making a huge impact on the energy sector with battery storage. With both Powerwall and especially with the Megapack, we are dramatically improving the ability to generate more energy from the grid. Let me sort of talk a little bit about that, which is if you look at total US energy capability, for example, there's roughly a terawatt of continuous power available in the US. But the average usage over a twenty-four-hour cycle is only half a terawatt because of the big difference between day and night usage. If you buffer the energy with batteries, you can effectively double the energy output in the United States just with batteries, pulling no incremental power plants.
It's very difficult to build power plants. They take a long time. There's a lot of permitting. It's not an industry that's used to moving fast. We see the potential there for Tesla battery packs to greatly improve the energy output per year for any given grid, US or otherwise. We are also on the cusp of something really tremendous with Optimus, which I think is likely to be, has the potential to be, the biggest product of all time. It's a difficult project. It's worth noting that it's not just automatic. I'm unaware of any robot program by Ford or GM or, you know, in the by USC of car companies.
People might think of Tesla as a car company that mostly makes cars and battery packs. It's not just an obvious fall of a log thing to make Optimus, but we do have the ingredients of real-world AI and exceptional electrical mechanical engineering capabilities and the ability to scale production, which I don't think anyone else has all of those ingredients. With version 14 of self-driving, people can see the reactions of people online. They're quite amazed. Actually, anyone in the US can get version 14 if they just go and select ""I want the advanced software"" in their car.
If you're listening right now and you'd like to try it out, just go into settings and say, ""I want the advanced software,"" and you will get version 14. On the Megapack front, we unveiled Megablock, Mega Pack three. We also have exciting plans for MegaPack four. MegaPack four will incorporate a lot of what is normally in a substation and be able to output at probably 35 kilovolts directly. This greatly improves our ability to deploy Megapack because it's not dependent on building a substation up through 35 KB for MegaPack four. That's the engineering priority for Megapack. We look forward to unveiling Optimus b three probably in Q1. I think it'll be ready to show off.
That, I think, is going to be quite remarkable. It won't even seem like a robot. It'll seem like a person in a robot suit, which is kind of how we started off with Optimus. It'll seem so real that you'll need to poke it, I think, to believe that it's actually a robot. Obviously, the real-world intelligence we've developed for the car, most of that transfers to Optimus. It's a very good starting point. In conclusion, we're excited about the updated mission of Tesla, which is sustainable abundance.
Going beyond sustainable energy to say, sustainable abundance is the mission, where we believe with Optimus and self-driving, we can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care. Optimus will be an incredible surgeon, for example. Imagine if everyone had access to an incredible surgeon. Of course, we make sure Optimus is safe and everything, but I do think we're headed for a world of sustainable abundance. I'm excited to work with the Tesla team to make that happen.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you very much, Elon. Vaibhav also has some opening remarks.
Vaibhav Taneja:
Thanks, Travis. Q3 was a special quarter at multiple levels. We set new records not just for deliveries and deployments, but also around a range of financial metrics from total revenues, energy gross profit, energy margins to fresh free cash flow. This was the result of continued confidence of our customers in our products and the relentless efforts of the Tesla team. The strength in deliveries was attributed to strong performance across all regions. Greater China and APAC were up sequentially 33%, North America was up 28%, while EMEA was up 25%. The pace in deliveries was the function of continued excitement around the new Model Y.
I had previously talked about 2025 being the year of the Y, and we have since delivered on that promise. Model Y was released in Q1, followed by Model Y long wheelbase and performance, and more recently, Standard Y in North America and EMEA. We are now operating a robotaxi in two markets, Austin and most various cities. We have already expanded our coverage area in Austin three times since the initial launch and are on pace to continue expanding further. Unlike our competitors, our robotaxi fleet blends in the markets we operate in since they don't have extra sensor sets or peripherals which make them stick out.
This is an underappreciated aspect of our current vehicle offerings, which are all designed for autonomous driving. We feel that as people experience the supervised FSD at scale, demand for our vehicles, like Elon said, would increase significantly. On the FSD adoption front, we've continued to see decent progress. However, note that the total paid FSD customer base is still small, around 12% of our current fleet. We are working with regulators in places like China and EMEA to obtain approvals so that we can deploy FSD in those regions as well. Now covering a little bit on the financial side, automotive revenues increased 29% in line with the growth in deliveries.
While regulatory credits declined sequentially, we entered into new contracts and continued delivery on previously entered contracts. Our automotive margins, excluding credits, increased marginally from 15% to 15.4%. This was attributed to improvements in material cost and better fixed cost absorption due to higher volumes. The energy storage business continued to deliver with record deployments, gross profit, and margins. As discussed before, this business has a bigger impact from tariffs, as measured by percentage of COGS since currently all sales procured are from China while we're still working on other alternatives. However, as the ramp of mega factory Shanghai is happening, this is helping us avoid tariffs. We are using this factory to supply the non-US demand.
Like Elon said, grid-scale storage is the only way we can get to electricity fastest by using storage. The other thing to keep in mind is we are seeing headwinds in this business given the increase in competition and tariffs. The total tariff impacts for Q3 for both businesses were in excess of $400 million, generally split evenly between them. Services and other demonstrated a marked improvement sequentially. This was a function of improvements primarily in our insurance and service center businesses. Note that while small, our robotaxi costs are included within services and other along with our other businesses like paid supercharging, used car, parts and merchandise sales, etc. Our operating expenses increased sequentially.
The largest increase included in restructuring and other related to certain actions undertaken to reduce cost and improve efficiency to convergence of our AR AI chip design efforts. Additionally, we incurred legal expenses related to proceedings in certain legal cases. As incremental cost incurred preparation for our shareholder meeting. Such costs are recorded within SG&A. Further, our employee-related spend is increasing, especially in R&D. We have recently granted various performance-based equity awards to employees working on AI initiatives. Therefore, such spend will continue to increase forward. On other income, our other income decreased sequentially primarily from mark-to-market adjustments on BTC Holdings, which was a much smaller gain of $80 million in Q3 versus $284 million in Q2.
With the rest of the movement attributable to FX movements in the quarter. Our free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $4 billion, which was yet another record. Our total cash and investments at the end of the quarter were over $41 billion. On the CapEx front, while we are expecting to be around $9 billion for the current year, we're projecting the numbers to increase substantially in 2026 as we prepare the company for the next phase of growth in terms of not just our existing businesses, but our bets around AI initiatives, including Optimus. In conclusion, note that bringing AI into the real world is hard. But we have never shied away from doing what is hard.
We are extremely excited about the future and are laying down the foundation, the benefits of which will be realized over years to come. I would like to end by thanking the Tesla team, our customers, our investors, and supporters for the continued belief in us. Thank you very much, Vibhav. Now let's go to investor questions.
Travis Axelrod:
From say.com, the first question is, what are the latest robo taxi metrics fleet size, cumulative miles, rides completed, intervention rates, when will safety drivers be removed? What are the obstacles still preventing unsupervised FSD from being deployed to customer vehicles?
Elon Musk:
I'll start off with that, and then Ashok can elaborate. We are expecting to have no safety drivers in at least large parts of Austin by the end of this year. So within a few months, we expect to have no safety drivers at all in at least parts of Austin. We're obviously being very cautious about the deployment. Our goal is to be actually paranoid about deployment because, obviously, even one accident will be front-page headline news worldwide. It's better for us to take a cautious approach here. But we do expect to have no safety drivers in the car in Austin within a few months. I think that's perhaps the most important data point.
We do expect to be operating robotaxi in, I think, about eight to ten metro areas by the end of the year. It depends on various regulatory approvals. You can actually think most of our regulatory applications are online. You can kind of see them because they're public information. We expect to be operating in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona by the end of the year. Ashok?
Ashok Elluswamy:
Yeah. We continue to operate our fleet in Austin without anyone in the driver's seat, and we have covered more than a quarter million miles with that. In the Bay Area, we still have a person in the driver's seat due to the regulations, and we've crossed more than a million miles. We continue to see that the robotaxi fleet works really well. Customers are really happy, and there are no notable issues. On the customer side, we have FSD supervised for a total of 6 billion miles as of yesterday. That's a big milestone. Overall, the safety continues to be very good.
As Elon mentioned, we are on track to remove the person from inside the car altogether, starting with Austin.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. The next question is, what is the demand and backlog for Megapack, Powerwall, solar, or energy storage systems? With the current AI boom, is Tesla planning to supply power to other hyperscalers?
Elon Musk:
Thanks.
Michael Snyder:
Demand for Megapack and Powerwall continues to be really strong into next year. We received very strong positive customer feedback on our Mega Block product, which will begin shipping next year out of Houston. We're seeing remarkable growth in the demand for AI and data center applications as hyperscalers and utilities have seen the versatility of the Megapack product. It increases reliability and relieves grid constraints, as Elon was talking about. We've also seen a surge in residential solar demand in the US due to policy changes, which we expect to continue into 2026 as we introduce the new solar lease product.
We also began production of our Tesla residential solar panel in our Buffalo factory, and we will be shipping that to customers starting Q1. The panel has industry-leading aesthetics and shape performance and demonstrates our continued commitment to US manufacturing.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you, Mike. Unfortunately, the next question is related to future products. This is not the appropriate venue to cover that, so we're going to have to skip it. The question after that is, what are the present challenges in bringing Optimus to market considering app control software engineering hardware, training general mobility models, training task-specific models, training voice models, implementing manufacturing, and establishing supply chains?
Elon Musk:
Yeah. I mean, bringing Optimus to market is an incredibly difficult task, to be clear. It's not like some walk in the park. At some point, I mean, actually, technically, Optimus can walk in the park right now. We do have Optimus robots that walk around our offices at our engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, California, basically twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Any visitors that come by can actually stop one of the Optimus robots and ask it to take them somewhere, and it'll literally take them to that meeting room or that location in the building.
I don't want to downplay the difficulty, but it's an incredibly difficult thing, especially to create a hand that is as dexterous and capable as the human hand, which is incredible. The human hand is an incredible thing. The more you study the human hand, the more incredible you realize it is, and why you need four fingers and a thumb, why the fingers have certain degrees of freedom, why the various muscles are of different strengths, and fingers are of different lengths. It turns out that those are all there for a reason.
Making the hand and forearm, because most of the actuators, just like the human hand, the muscles that control your hand are actually primarily in your forearm. The Optimus hand and forearm is an incredibly difficult engineering challenge. I'd say it's more difficult than the rest of the robot from an electromechanical standpoint. The forearm and hand are more difficult than the entire rest of the robot. But really, in order to have a useful generalized robot, you do need an incredible hand. Then you need the real-world AI, and you need to be able to scale up that production to have it be relevant because it's not relevant if it's just a few hundred robots.
You need to be able to make Optimus robots at volumes comparable to vehicles, not significantly higher. So trying to make a million Optimus robots per year, that manufacturing challenge is immense considering that the supply chain doesn't exist. With cars, you've got an existing supply chain. With computers, you've got an existing supply chain. With a humanoid robot, there is no supply chain. In order to manufacture that, Tesla actually has to be very vertically integrated and manufacture very deep into the supply chain, manufacture the parts internally because there just is no supply chain.
This is the kind of thing where I'm like, if I put myself in the position of a startup trying to make a humanoid robot, I'm like, I don't know how to do it without an immense amount of manufacturing technology. That's why I think Tesla is in almost a unique position when you consider manufacturing technology, scaling real-world AI, and a truly dexterous hand. Those are generally the things that are missing when you read about other robots that just don't have those three things. I think we can achieve all those things with an immense amount of work, and that is the game plan.
My fundamental concern with regard to how much voting control I have at Tesla is if I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? That's my biggest concern. That is really the only thing I'm trying to address with this. It's called compensation, but it's not like I'm going to go spend the money. It's just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army, not current control, but a strong influence? That's what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don't feel comfortable wielding that robot army if I don't have at least a strong influence.
Ashok Elluswamy:
Great. Thank you.
Travis Axelrod:
We've already covered robotaxi expansion. Unfortunately, the question after that is another future product question, so we're going to have to skip that. The next one, though, is can you update us on the $16.5 billion Samsung chip deal in Taylor? The importance of semiconductors to autonomy in Tesla's AI-driven future, what gives you confidence Samsung can fulfill AI six at Tesla's timelines? And achieve relatively better yields and cost versus TSMC.
Elon Musk:
Okay. I'm going to give quite a long answer to this question because I have to unpack this question and then answer the unpacked version. First of all, I have nothing but great things to say about Samsung. They're an amazing company. Samsung, it's worth noting, does manufacture our AI four computer and does a great job doing that. Now with the AI five, and here's where I need to make a point of clarification relative to some comments I've made publicly before, which is we're actually going to focus both TSMC and Samsung initially on AI five. The AI five chip designed by Tesla is, I think, an amazing design.
I've spent almost every weekend for the last few months with the chip design team working on AI five. I don't hand out praise easily, but I have to say that I think the TensorFlow team is really an incredible chip here. By some metrics, the AI five chip will be 40 times better than the AI four chip. Not 40%, 40 times. Because we have a detailed understanding of the entire software and hardware stack, we're designing the hardware to address all of the pain points in software. I don't think there's really anyone that's doing this thing the entire stack all the way through real-world.
You know, calibrating against the real world where you've got cars and robots in the real world, we know what the chip needs to do, and we know just as importantly, we know what the chip doesn't need to do. To sort of use some examples here, with the AI five, we deleted the legacy GPU or the traditional GPU, which is in AI four. But AI five does not have, we just deleted the legacy GPU because it basically is a GPU. We also deleted the image signal processor. This looks like a long list of deletions that are very important.
As a result of these deletions, we can actually fit AI five in a half reticle and with good margin for traces from the memory to the Tesla accelerators, the ARM CPU cores, and the PCI blocks. This is a beautiful chip. I've poured so much life energy into this chip personally, and I'm confident this is going to be a winner. Next level. It makes sense to have both Samsung and TSMC focus on AI five. Even though technically, Samsung fab has slightly more advanced equipment than the TSMC fab. These will both be made in the US, one TSMC in Arizona, Samsung in Texas. We're going to make starting off just to be confident.
Our explicit goal is to have an oversupply of AI five chips. If we have too many AI five chips for the cars and robots, we can always put them in the data center. We already use AI four for training in our data center. We use a combination of AI four and NVIDIA hardware. We're not about to replace NVIDIA, to be clear, but we do use both in combination. AI four and NVIDIA hardware, and the AI five excess production can always be put in our data centers. NVIDIA keeps improving. The challenge that they have is that they've got to satisfy a large range of requirements from a lot of customers.
Tesla only has to satisfy requirements from one customer, Tesla. That makes the design job radically easier and means we can delete a lot of complexity from the chip. I can't emphasize how important this is. When you look at the various logic blocks in the chip, you increase the number of logic blocks, you also increase the interconnections between the logic blocks. If you can think of it like there are highways, like how many highways do you need to connect the various parts of the chip?
Especially if you're not sure how much data is going to go between each logic block on the chip, then you kind of end up having giant highways going all over the place. It's a very, it becomes almost an impossibly difficult design problem, and NVIDIA has done an amazing job of dealing with almost an impossibly difficult set of requirements. But in our case, we're going for radical simplicity. The net effect is that I think AI five will be the best performance per watt, maybe by a factor of two or three, and best performance per dollar for AI, maybe by a factor of 10.
We'll have to, the proof's in the pudding, so obviously, we need to actually get this chip made and made at scale. But that's what it looks like.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you, Elon. We've already covered unsupervised FSD. So the next question is, instead of trying to replace hardware three with hardware four, why not give an equal incentive to trade in for a new vehicle?
Vaibhav Taneja:
Yeah. We've not completely given up on hardware three. However, over the last year, we've offered the customers the option to transfer FSD to their new vehicle. At times, we've been running some promotions. If they've got FSD, they can get better preferential rates. We've been taking care of this. We do want to solve autonomy first. Then we'll come back with a way to take care of these customers. These customers are very important. They were the early adopters. For what it's worth, my daily commuter is a hardware three car, which I use FSD on a daily basis. We will definitely take care of you guys.
Ashok Elluswamy:
Once the v 14 release series is fully done, we are planning on working on a v 14 Lite version for hardware three. Probably expected in Q2 next year.
Travis Axelrod:
Awesome. Thanks, Ashok. Alrighty. Our final question from Se is, how long until we see self-driving Tesla Semi trucks? And could you see this technology replacing trains?
Elon Musk:
Yeah. So I guess I'll start with that in terms of the semi,
Lars Moravy:
production plan and schedule. The factory is going on schedule. We've completed the building and are installing the equipment now. We've got our fleet of validation trucks driving on the road. We'll have a larger build towards the end of this year and then our first online builds in the first part of next year, ramping into the Q2 timing with real volume coming in the back half of the year. That's going quite well, and that's the first step to obviously getting autonomous trucks on the road. In terms of trains, they're really great for long point-to-point deliveries.
They're super efficient, but that last mile, the load-unload can be better served for shorter distances with autonomous semis, and that would be great. We do expect that to probably shift in as we, as Elon said, change the way transportation is considered. We're looking forward to that timeline. Ashok, I know you can take the full self-driving part.
Ashok Elluswamy:
Currently, the team is super focused on solving for passenger vehicles autonomy. That said, the same technology will apply quite easily to the semi truck once we have a little bit of data from the semi trucks.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. And now we will move over to analyst questions. The first question comes from Emmanuel, at Wolfe. Emmanuel, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Emmanuel Rosner:
Great. Thanks so much. Hi, everybody. So Elon, you talked about expanding production of vehicles as fast as possible now that you have confidence in the unsupervised autonomy. How should we think about that in the context of your existing capacity of 3 million units? Is that where you're hoping to get volume to? What sort of timeline are we talking about? And would this require some level of boosting or incentivizing demand? Like would this basically be prioritizing volume over near-term profitability given the longer-term opportunity?
Elon Musk:
Well, capacity isn't quite 3 million. But it will be 3 million at some point. Aspirationally, it could be 3 million within, we could probably hit an annualized rate of 3 million within twenty-four months, I think. Maybe less than twenty-four months. Bear in mind, there's an entire supply chain, a vast supply chain that's got to also move in tandem with that. I think we're going to expand production as fast as we can and as fast as our suppliers can keep up with it. Then we're going to think about where we build incremental factories beyond that. The single biggest expansion in production will be the Cyber Cap, which starts production in Q2 next year.
That's really a vehicle that's optimized for full autonomy. It, in fact, does not have a steering wheel or pedals and is really an enduring optimization on minimizing cost per mile for fully considered cost per mile of operation. For our other vehicles, they still have a little bit of the horse carriage thing going on where, obviously, if you've got steering wheels and pedals and you're designing a car that people might want to go very direct past acceleration and tight cornering, like high-performance cars, then you're going to design a different car than one that is optimized for a comfortable ride and doesn't expect to go past sort of 85 or 90 miles an hour.
It's just aiming for a gentle ride the whole time. That's what Cyber Cap is. Do I think we'll sacrifice margins? I don't think so. I think the demand will be pretty nutty. Here's the killer app, really. What it comes down to is, can you text while you're in the car? If you tell someone, yes, the car is now so good, you can be on your phone and text the entire time while you're in the car, anyone who can buy the car will buy the car. End of story. That's what everybody wants to do. In fact, not everyone wants to. They do that.
That's why, in fact, the reason you've seen an uptick in accidents, pretty much worldwide, is because people are texting and driving. Autopilot actually dramatically improves the safety here. If someone's looking down at their phone, they're not driving very well. That's really the game changer. At this point, I feel essentially 100% confident, I say not essentially, 100% confident that we can solve unsupervised full self-driving at a safety level much greater than human. We've released 14.1, got a technology roadmap that's, I think, pretty amazing. We'll be adding reasoning to the car. Our world simulator for reinforcement learning is pretty incredible.
Our Tesla reality simulator, when you see it, the video that's generated by the Tesla reality simulator and the actual video looks exactly the same. That allows us to have a very powerful reinforcement learning loop to further improve the Tesla AI. We're going to be increasing the parameter count by an order of magnitude. That's not in 14.1. There are also a number of other improvements to the AI that are quite radical. This car will feel like it is a living creature. That's how good the AI will get with the AI four computer before AI five. AI five, like I said, is by some metrics forty times better. But just to say safely, it's a 10x improvement.
It might almost be too much intelligence for a car. I do wonder, like, how much intelligence should you have in a car? It might get bored. One of the things I thought of, like, well, if we've got all these cars that maybe are bored, well, why they're sort of, if they are bored, we could actually have a giant distributed inference fleet. If they're not actively driving, just have a giant distributed inference fleet.
At some point, if you've got tens of millions of cars in the fleet, or maybe at some point 100 million cars in the fleet, and let's say they had, at that point, I don't know, a kilowatt of inference capability of high-performance inference capability, that's 100 gigawatts of inference distributed with power and cooling taken with cooling and power conversion taken care of. That seems like a pretty significant asset.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thanks, Elon. The next question comes from Adam from Morgan Stanley. Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself. Adam, go ahead and ask your question. Seems like we might be having some audio issues with Adam, so we'll come back to you. Next question will then come from Dan, from Barclays.
Dan Meir Levy:
Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Elon, I know that Tesla's really focused on with master plan for bringing AI into the physical world. I think we've seen over the past, you know, this willingness for Tesla to engage and go into new markets, new TAMs. So when you think about the growth prospects, how do we define the areas that are really within Tesla's core competency versus where do you draw the line for markets or AI applications that are outside of Tesla's core competency?
Elon Musk:
Actually, I'm not sure what you mean by AI applications outside of Tesla's core competency. We kind of didn't have any of these core competencies when we started, you know. We had zero core competencies, total competency of zero, actually. You can think of Tesla as, like, I don't know, a dozen startups in one company. I've initiated every one of those startups. We didn't used to make battery packs, stationary battery packs, but now we do. We make them for the home, make them for utility scale with Powerwall and Megapack. We created the supercharger network globally. No one else has created a global supercharger network.
In fact, the North American supercharger network is so good that basically, yeah, every other manufacturer in North America has converted to our standard and uses the Tesla Supercharger network. If it was so easy, why didn't they just do it? The Chef Design team started that from scratch. The Tesla AI software team was started from scratch. I literally just said, hey, we're going to start this thing. I posted it on Twitter, now X. Join us if you'd like to build it. In fact, Ashok was, I believe, the first person I interviewed for the Tesla autopilot team, which we now call Tesla AI software team because it is the AI software team.
Core competencies created while you wait. Optimus at scale is the infinite money glitch. It's difficult to express the magnitude of, like, if you've got something that, like, if Optimus, I think, probably achieves five times the productivity of a person per year because it can operate twenty-four seven. It doesn't even need to charge. It can operate tethered. It's plugged in the whole time. That's why I call it, like, if you're true of sustainable abundance, where working will be optional. There's a limit to how much AI can do in enhancing the productivity of humans. There is not really a limit to AI that is embodied. That's why I called the infinite money glitch.
Vaibhav Taneja:
I mean, one thing which I'll further add is, I mean, forget, like, our first iteration of autopilot was ten years back. Elon had started this way back in the day. We've got the twist to prove it. Exactly. Even on the Optimus side, as much as people think, oh, good, this is a new thing. Still remember, was it four plus years back? We were in a meeting with Elon, and Elon said, hey, our car is a robot on wheels. That's where we started developing. In fact, most of the engineering team working on Optimus has come from the vehicle side.
That's why, you know, when we talk about manufacturing progress, we have the wherewithal because the same engineers who worked back in the day on drive units are working on actuators now. If there is any company which can do it at scale, that is going to be us.
Elon Musk:
We also have actually added a lot of new engineers as well to the team. A lot of the credit for the Optimus engineering is actually also near new engineers, many of them that are just out of college, actually. The Optimus engineering team is a very talented engineering team. I'd say, like, wow, actually. The Optimus reviews at this point are that there's the engineering review and then there's the manufacturing review. Being done simultaneously. With an iterative loop between engineering design and manufacturing. We design something and we say, like, oh, man, that's really difficult to make. We need to change that design to make it easier to manufacture.
We've made radical improvements to the design of Optimus while increasing the functionality, but making it actually possible to manufacture. I'd say Optimus two is almost impossible to manufacture, frankly. But my two-point, we've gone from a person in a robot outfit to what people have seen with Optimus 2.5 where it's doing kung fu. Optimus was at the Tron premiere doing kung fu, just up in the open, with Jared Leto. Nobody was controlling it. It was just doing kung fu with Jared Leto at the Tron Premier. You can see the videos online. The funny thing is, a lot of people walked past it thinking it was just a person.
Even though with Optimus 2.5, you can see that it has a waist that's three inches wide. It results in not a human. But the movements were so human-like that a lot of people didn't realize they were looking at a robot. What I'm saying is, Optimus three will be a giant improvement on that. Made at scale, like I said, a very difficult thing. The Optimus engineering and manufacturing reviews and there's the Friday night meeting with Optimus, which sometimes goes till midnight. My Saturday meeting is with the AI chip design team. Two things are crucial to the future of the company.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. And Dan, do you have a follow-up?
Dan Meir Levy:
Yeah. I think just as a related, maybe you could just talk about to what extent are the AI efforts at Tesla and x AI complementary, or are they just different forms of AI? Maybe you can just distinguish for the audience. Thank you.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. There are different forms of AI. The XAI, so Grok is like a giant model. You could not possibly squeeze Grok onto a car. That's for sure. It is a giant piece of a model. With Grok, it's trying to solve for artificial general intelligence with a massive amount of AI training compute and inference compute. For example, Grok five will actually only run effectively on a GV 300. That's how much of a beast Grok five is. Whereas Tesla's models are, I don't know, maybe about less than 10% the size, maybe closer to 5% the size of Grok. They're really at the problem from very different angles.
XAI and Grok are competing with Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT and that kind of thing. Some of it's complementary. For example, for Grok voice, being able to interact with Grok in the car is cool. Grok for Optimus voice recognition and audio voice generation is Grok, so that's helpful there. But they are coming at it from kind of opposite ends of the spectrum.
Travis Axelrod:
Alrighty. Adam, let's give it another try. When you're ready, please unmute yourself for the next question. Alrighty. Unfortunately, Adam is having audio issues. So we're going to move on to Walt from LightShed. Walt, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Walt:
Can you hear me now?
Travis Axelrod:
Yes. Perfect. Thank you.
Walt:
Just getting back to Austin. If you can remove the safety driver at year-end, is the limitation in the Bay Area just regulatory, or is it kind of the market by market learning process? Similarly, in the eight to ten markets that you mentioned to get added, is the decision there to put a safety attendant in the passenger seat or the safety driver in, is that like your step-by-step process to opening up a market, or is it really just the regulation and the individual market?
Elon Musk:
Well, I think even if the regulators weren't making us do it, we'd still do that as the right sort of cautious approach to a new market. Just to make sure that we're being paranoid about safety, I think it makes sense to have a safety driver or safety occupant in the car when we first go to new markets to confirm that there's not something we're missing. All it takes is one in 10,000 trips to go wrong, and you've got an issue. It just makes sure, like, is there some peculiarity about a city, like a very difficult intersection or something that's an unexpected challenge in a city for that one in 10,000 situation.
We probably could just let it loose in these cities, but we just don't want to take a chance. What we're talking about here is maybe three months of safety driver in a new metro to confirm that it's good, and then we take the safety driver off, that kind of thing.
Walt:
Okay. Then on FSD 14, it has a different feel than 13, and it's also, I think, a little different than what it feels like in Austin. Is it basically different development paths that you're doing in terms of the robotaxi stuff versus what you're dropping to the early adopters? When you push these new builds, is it that you're looking for notable improvements in intervention rates, or is that largely solved and it's more about adding the functionality, like the parking, the drive modes, or just the overall comfort?
Elon Musk:
The first priority when we release a major new software architecture for Autopilot is safety. It starts off with safety, obviously, safety prioritized, and then solve comfort thereafter. That's why I don't recommend people take the initial version. That's why I say, like, yeah, most people should wait until 14.2 before they actually download version 14. By 14.2, we will have addressed many of the comfort issues. The priority is very much safety first and then thereafter, the comfort issues. That's why most people are like, it'll be safe but jerky. We just need time to smooth the rough edges and solve for comfort in addition to safety with a major new autopilot architecture change.
I know what the roadmap is for the Tesla real-world AI in very granular detail. Obviously, Ashok is leading that. I mean, I spend a lot of time with the team going in excruciating detail here on what we're doing to improve the real-world AI. This car is going to feel like it is a living creature. That's with AI four before even AI five.
Ashok Elluswamy:
Yeah. The roadmap is super exhilarating. We're waiting so much, like, at least all the stuff we are working on. In terms of what we ship to customers versus robotaxi, it's mostly the same. Customers have some more features like, you know, they can choose the car wants to park in a spot or drive you or something like that, which is not super relevant for robotaxi. But there's only a few minor changes like those ones. But the majority of the algorithms and architecture, everything is the same between those two platforms.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, we'll be adding reasoning to, I don't know, reasoning in 14.3, maybe 14.4, something like that.
Ashok Elluswamy:
Yeah. See here. Or by end of this year, for sure.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. With reasoning, it's literally going to think about which parking spot to pick. It's going to say, this is the entrance, but actually, probably, there's not a parking spot right at the entrance. If it's a full, you know, if the parking lot is fairly full, the probability of an open parking spot right at the entrance is very low. But actually, what it'll simply do is drop you off at the entrance of the store and then go find a parking spot. It's going to get very smart about figuring out a parking spot. It's going to spot empty spots better than a human. It's got 360-degree vision, and it's going to, yeah.
Ashok Elluswamy:
Yeah. Like I said, it's going to use reasoning to solve things.
Elon Musk:
Yep. Putting that all inside the computer that has AI four is the actual challenge. That's what the team is working on. Obviously, you can do reasoning on the server that takes forever. But then in the car, you need to make real-time decisions. Putting all the, you know, that's in the car, that's the challenge.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. That's why I say, like, I have a pretty good understanding of AI, you know, the giant model level with Grok and with Tesla. I'm confident in saying that Tesla has the highest intelligence density. When you look at the intelligence per gigabyte, I think Tesla AI is probably an order of magnitude better than anyone else. It doesn't have any choice because that AI has got to fit in the AI four computer. The discipline of having that level of AI intelligence density will pay great dividends when you go to something that has an order of magnitude more capability like AI five.
Now you have that same intelligence density, but you've got 10 times more capability in the computer.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. The next question will come from Colin at Oppenheimer. Colin, please unmute yourself when you're ready.
Colin Langan:
Colin, go ahead and unmute yourself, please.
Colin Langan:
Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate you bringing up the challenges of hand dexterity in humanoids, along with the state of the supply chain and the vertical integration you guys are pursuing. I'm just trying to harmonize the timeline for the start of production next year with the state of the supply chain. What sounds like a fair amount of work remains on the dexterity before you can really freeze the hardware design and start to scale up production.
Elon Musk:
Well, the hardware design will not actually be frozen even through the start of production. There'll be continued iteration. A bunch of the things that you discover are very difficult to make. You only find that pretty late in the game. We'll be doing rolling changes for the Optimus design even after the start of production. I do think that the new hand is an incredible piece of engineering. We'll actually have a production intent prototype ready to show off in Q1, probably February or March. We're going to be building a million units Optimus production line, hopefully with the production start towards the end of next year.
That production ramp will take a while to get to an annualized rate of a million because it's going to move as fast as the slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items. But it will get to a million units. Ultimately, we'll do Optimus four. That'll be 10 million units. Optimus five, maybe 50 to 100 million units. It's really pretty nutty.
Travis Axelrod:
Alrighty. That is unfortunately all the time we have for Q&A today. Before we conclude though, Vaibhav has some closing remarks.
Vaibhav Taneja:
Thanks, Travis. I want to take the time to talk about an extremely important work which is being held on November 6. The meeting will shape the future of Tesla. We are asking you as our shareholders to support Elon's leadership through the two compensation proposals and the reelection of Ira, Kathleen, and Joe to the board. Note that it is a team sport. Here at Tesla, the board is an integral part of the winning team. Shareholders are the center of everything we do at Tesla, and a special committee has laid out a compensation package. Like Elon said, we don't even want to call it a compensation package.
Elon Musk:
Yeah. It's just like the point is that I just need enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can't be fired if I go insane. I think that sort of number is in the mid-twenties approximately. As a company that has already gone public, we've investigated every possible way to achieve voting control without, you know, is there some way to have a supervoting stock, but there really isn't. There is no way to have a supervoting stock after you've gone public. For example, Google, Meta, many other companies have this. But they had it before they went public. It sort of gets, I guess, grandfathered in. Tesla does not have that.
Like I said, I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists. The problem, yeah. Let me explain, like, the core problem here is that so many of the index funds, passive funds, vote along the lines of whatever Glass Lewis and ISS recommend. They've made many terrible recommendations in the past. If those recommendations had been followed, they would have been extremely destructive to the future of the company.
But if you've got passive funds that essentially defer responsibility for the vote to Glass Lewis and ISS, then you can have extremely disastrous consequences for a publicly traded company if too much of the publicly traded company is controlled by index funds. It's de facto controlled by Glass Lewis and ISS. This is a fundamental problem for corporate governance. They're not voting along the lines that are actually good for shareholders. That's the big issue. That's what it comes down to. ISS, Glass Lewis, corporate terrorism.
Vaibhav Taneja:
Yeah. I would say, you know, the special committee did an amazing job constructing this plan for the benefit of the shareholders. There's nothing which gets passed on till the time shareholders make substantial returns. That's why in the end, I would say, would urge you to not only vote on the plan but also vote on all the three directors because of their exceptional knowledge and experience. Literally, you know, we at Tesla work with these directors day in, day out. There is not even a single day that one of the directors I haven't spoken to or one of my colleagues hasn't spoken to. Even the directors out here are not just reading out of PowerPoint presentations.
They're actually working with us day in, day out. Again, I just urge you guys as shareholders to vote along the board's recommendation. Thank you, guys.
Travis Axelrod:
Great. Thank you, Vaibhav. We appreciate everyone's questions today. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye."

President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. In our fiscal Q1 2025, total revenue was a record $14.9 billion, up 25% year on year, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record again $10.1 billion, up 41% year on year. So, let me first provide color on our Semiconductor business. Q1 Semiconductor revenue was $8.2 billion, up 11% year on year.
Growth was driven by AI, as AI revenue of $4.1 billion was up 77% year on year. We beat our guidance for AI revenue of $3.8 billion due to stronger shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers on AI. Our hyperscaler partners continue to invest aggressively in their next-generation frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators, as well as AI data centers with larger clusters. And consistent with this, we are stepping up our R&D investment on two fronts.
One, we're pushing the envelope of technology in creating the next generation of accelerators. We're taping out the industry's first two-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D as we drive toward a 10,000 teraflops XPU. Secondly, we have a view toward scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. We have doubled the RAID X capacity of the existing Tomahawk sites.
And beyond this, to enable AI clusters to scale up on Ethernet toward 1 million XPUs, we have tapped out our next generation 100 terabit Tomahawk 6 switch running 200G studies at 1.6 terabit bandwidth. We will be delivering samples to customers within the next few months. These R&D investments are very aligned with the roadmap of our three hyperscale customers as they each raise toward 1 million XPU clusters by the end of 2027. And accordingly, we do reaffirm what we said last quarter that we expect these three hyperscale customers will generate a Serviceable Addressable Market or SAM in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027.
Beyond these three customers, we had also mentioned previously that we are deeply engaged with two other hyperscalers in enabling them to create their own customized AI accelerator. We are on track to tape out their XPUs this year. In the process of working with the hyperscalers, it has become very clear that while they are excellent in software, Broadcom is the best in hardware. Working together is what optimizes via large language models.
It is, therefore, no surprise to us since our last earnings call that two additional hyperscalers have selected Broadcom to develop custom accelerators to train their next-generation frontier models. So, even as we have three hyperscale customers, we are shipping XPUs in volume today, there are now four more who are deeply engaged with us to create their own accelerators. And to be clear, of course, these four are not included in our estimated SAM of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. So, we do see an exciting trend here.
New frontier models and techniques put unexpected pressures on AI systems. It's difficult to serve all clusters of models with a single system design point. And therefore, it is hard to imagine that a general-purpose accelerator can be configured and optimized across multiple frontier models. And as I mentioned before, the trend toward XPUs is a multi-year journey.
So, coming back to 2025, we see a steady ramp in deployment of our XPUs and networking products. In Q1, AI revenue was $4.1 billion, and we expect Q2 AI revenue to grow to $4.4 billion, which is up 44% year on year. Turning to non-AI semiconductors. Revenue of $4.1 billion was down 9% sequentially on a seasonal decline in wireless.
In aggregate, during Q1, the recovery in non-AI semiconductors continued to be slow. Broadband, which bottomed in Q4 2024, showed a double-digit sequential recovery in Q1 and is expected to be up similarly in Q2 as service providers and telcos step up spending. Server storage was down single digits sequentially in Q1 but is expected to be up high-single digits sequentially in Q2. Meanwhile, enterprise networking continues to remain flattish in the first half of fiscal '25, as customers continue to work through channel inventory.
While wireless was down sequentially due to a seasonal decline, it remained flat year on year. In Q2, wireless is expected to be the same, flat again year on year. Resales in industrial were down double-digits in Q1 and are expected to be down in Q2. So, reflecting the foregoing puts and takes, we expect non-AI semiconductor revenue in Q2 to be flattish sequentially, even though we are seeing bookings continue to grow year on year.
In summary, for Q2, we expect total semiconductor revenue to grow 2% sequentially and up 17% year on year to $8.4 billion. Turning now to Infrastructure Software segment. Q1 Infrastructure Software revenue of $6.7 billion was up 47% year on year and up 15% sequentially, exaggerated, though, by deals which slipped from Q2 -- Q4 to Q1. Now, this is the first quarter Q1 '25, where the year-on-year comparables include VMware in both quarters.
We're seeing significant growth in the Software segment for two reasons. One, we're converting to a footprint of large -- sorry, we're converting from a footprint of largely perpetual license to one of full subscription. And as of today, we are over 60% done. Two, these perpetual licenses were only largely for compute virtualization, otherwise called vSphere.
We are upselling customers to a full-stack VCF, which enables the entire data center to be virtualized. And this enables customers to create their own private cloud environment on-prem. And as of the end of Q1, approximately 70% of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF. As these customers consume VCF, we still see a further opportunity for future growth.
As large enterprises adopt AI, they have to run their AI workloads on their on-prem data centers, which will include both GPU servers as well as traditional CPUs. And just as VCF virtualizes these traditional data centers using CPUs, VCF will also virtualize GPUs on the -- on a common platform and enable enterprises to import AI models to run their own data on-prem. This platform, which virtualized the GPU, is called the VMware Private AI Foundation. And as of today, in collaboration with NVIDIA, we have 39 enterprise customers for the VMware Private AI Foundation.
Customer demand has been driven by our open ecosystem, superior low balancing, and automation capabilities that allow them to intelligently pull and run workloads across both GPU and CPU infrastructure and leading to very reduced costs. Moving on to Q2 outlook for software. We expect revenue of $6.5 billion, up 23% year on year. So, in total, we're guiding Q2 consolidated revenue to be approximately $14.9 billion, up 19% year on year.
And this -- we expect this will drive Q2 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.
Kirsten M. Spears

Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer
Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance. From a year-on-year comparable basis, keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal 2024 was a 14-week quarter, and Q1 of fiscal 2025 is a 13-week quarter. Consolidated revenue was $14.9 billion for the quarter, up 25% from a year ago.
Gross margin was 79.1% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher infrastructure software revenue and more favorable semiconductor revenue mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, of which $1.4 billion was for R&D. Q1 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 44% from a year ago, with operating margin at 66% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $10.1 billion, or 68% of revenue above our guidance of 66%.
This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $8.2 billion and represented 55% of total revenue in the quarter, this was up 11% year on year. Gross margin for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was approximately 68%, up 70 basis points year on year, driven by revenue mix.
Operating expenses increased 3% year on year to $890 million on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors, resulting in semiconductor operating margin of 57%. Now, moving on to Infrastructure Software. Revenue for Infrastructure Software of $6.7 billion was 45% of total revenue and up 47% year on year based primarily on increased revenue from VMware. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 92.5% in the quarter compared to 88% a year ago.
Operating expenses were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in Infrastructure Software operating margin of 76%. This compares to operating margin of 59% a year ago. This year-on-year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of VMware and sharp focus on deploying our VCF strategy. Moving on to cash flow.
Free cash flow in the quarter was $6 billion and represented 40% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and cash taxes due to the mix of U.S. taxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174, and the impact of corporate AMC. We spent $100 million on capital expenditures.
Days Sales Outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 41 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 8% sequentially to support revenue in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 65 days in Q1 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the first quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and $68.8 billion of gross principal debt.
During the quarter, we repaid $495 million of fixed-rate debt and $7.6 billion of floating-rate debt with new senior notes, commercial paper, and cash on hand, reducing debt by a net $1.1 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $58.8 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.8% and 7.3 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $6 billion in floating rate debt is 5.4% and 3.8 years, respectively, and our $4 billion in commercial paper is at an average rate of 4.6%. Turning to capital allocation.
In Q1, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share. We spent $2 billion to repurchase 8.7 million AVGO shares from employees as those shares vested for withholding taxes. In Q2, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.95 billion shares. Now, moving on to guidance.
Our guidance for Q2 is for consolidated revenue of $14.9 billion with Semiconductor revenue of approximately $8.4 billion, up 17% year on year. We expect Q2 AI revenue of $4.4 billion, up 44% year on year. For non-AI semiconductors, we expect Q2 revenue of $4 billion. We expect Q2 Infrastructure Software revenue of approximately $6.5 billion, up 23% year on year.
We expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA to be about 66%. For modeling purposes, we expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 20 basis points sequentially on the revenue mix of infrastructure software and product mix within semiconductors. As Hock discussed earlier, we are increasing our R&D investment in leading-edge AI in Q2, and accordingly, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 and fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 14%.
That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.

Hey, guys. Thanks a lot, and congrats on the results. Hock, you talked about four more customers coming online. Can you just talk a little bit more about the trend you're seeing? Can any of these customers be as big as the current three? And what does this say about the custom silicon trend overall and your optimism and upside to the business long term? Thanks.
Hock E. Tan

President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
Well, very interesting question, Ben, and thanks for your kind wishes. But what we think as -- and by the way, these four are not yet customers as we define it. As I've always said, in developing and creating XPUs, we are not really the creator of those XPUs, to be honest. We enable each of those hyperscalers, partners we engage with to create that chip and to create -- basically to create that compute system, call it, that way.
And it comprises the model, the software model, working closely with the -- and the compute engine, the XPU, and the networking that buys together the clusters those multiple XPUs as a whole to train those large frontier models. And so, I mean, the fact that we create the hardware, it still has to work with the software models and algorithms of those partners of ours -- before it becomes fully deployable and scale which is why we define customers in this case as those where we know they have deployed at scale and will received the production volume to enable you to run. And for that, we only have three, just to reiterate. The four are, I call it, partners who are trying to create the same thing as the first three, and to run their own frontier models, each of it on to train their own frontier models.
And as I also said, it doesn't happen overnight to do the first chip could take -- would take typically a year and a half and that's very accelerated and which we could accelerate given that we essentially have a framework and a methodology that works right now. It works for the three customers. No reason for it to not work for the four, but we still need those four partners to create and to develop the software which we don't do to make it work. And to answer your question, there's no reason why these four guys would not create a demand in the range of what we're seeing with the first three guys, but probably later.
It's a journey. They started it later, and so they will probably get there later.

Good afternoon, and great job on the strong quarterly execution, Hock and team. Great to see the continual momentum in the AI business here in the first half of your fiscal year and the continued broadening out of your AI ASIC customers. I know, Hock, last earnings, you did call out a strong ramp in the second half of the fiscal year driven by new three-nanometer AI accelerated programs kind of ramping. Can you just help us either qualitatively, quantitatively profile the second half step up relative to what the team just delivered here in the first half? Has the profile changed either favorably, less favorably versus what you thought maybe 90 days ago because, quite frankly, I mean, a lot has happened since last earnings, right? You've had the dynamics like DeepSeek and focus on AI model efficiency, but on the flip side, you've had strong capex outlooks by your cloud and hyperscale customers.
So, any color on the second half AI profile would be helpful.

You asking me to look into the minds of my customers, and I hate to tell me, they don't tell you -- they don't show me the entire mindset here. But one -- why we're beating the numbers so far in Q1 and seems to be encouraging in Q2 partly from improved networking shipments, as I indicated to cluster those XPUs and AI accelerators even in some cases, GPUs together for the hyperscalers, and that's good. And partly also, we think there is some pull-ins of shipments and acceleration, call it that way of shipments in fiscal '25.

Great. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on these pretty great results. It seems from the news headlines about tariffs and about DeepSeek that there may be some disruptions, some customers and some other complementary suppliers seem to feel a bit paralyzed perhaps, and have difficulty making tough decisions.
Those tend to be really useful times for great companies to sort of emerge as something bigger and better than they were in the past. You've grown this company in a tremendous way over the last decade plus. And you're doing great now, especially in this AI area, but I wonder if you're seeing that sort of disruption from these dynamics that we suspect are happening based on headlines what we see from other companies. And how -- aside from adding these customers in AI, I'm sure there's other great stuff going on, but should we expect some bigger changes to come from Broadcom as a result of this?
Hock E. Tan

President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
You asked -- you posed a very interesting set of issues and questions. And those are very relevant, interesting issues. The only issue -- the only problem we have at this point is, I would say, it's really too early to know where we all land. I mean, there's the threat, the noise of tariffs, especially on chips that hasn't materialized yet, nor do we know how it will be structured.
So, we don't know. But we do experience, and we are leaving it now, the disruption on -- that is -- in a positive way, I should add, a very positive disruption in semiconductors on generative AI. Generative AI, for sure, and I said that before the reason repeating here, but we feel it more than ever is really accelerating the development of semiconductor technology, both process, and packaging, as well as design toward higher and higher performance accelerators and networking functionality. We think that innovation those upgrades occur on every month as we face new interesting challenges.
And when particularly with XPUs, we're trying -- we've been asked to optimize to frontier models of our partners, our customers as well as our hyperscale partners. And we -- it's a lot of -- I mean, it's a privilege almost for us to be -- to participate in it and try to optimize -- and by optimize, I mean, you look at an accelerator, you can look at it for simple terms, high level to perform, to want to make the -- not just on one single metric, which is compute capacity, how many teraflops, it's more than that. It's also tied to the fact that this is a distributor computing problem. It's not just the compute capacity of a single XPU or GPU, it's also the network bandwidth it ties itself to the next adjacent XPU or GPU.
So, that has an impact. So, you're doing that. You have to balance with that. Then you decide, are you doing training or you're doing prefilling, post training, fine-tuning? And again, then comes how much memory do you balance against that.
And with it, how much latency you can afford, which is memory bandwidth? So, you look at least four variables, maybe even five if you include in-memory bandwidth, not just memory capacity when you go straight to inference. So, we have all these variables to play with, and we try to optimize it. So, all this is very, very -- I mean, it's a great experience for our engineers to push their envelope on how to create all those chips. And so, that's the biggest disruption we see right now from sheer trying to create and push the envelope on generative AI, trying to create the best hardware infrastructure to run it.
Beyond that, yeah, there are other things too that come into play because with AI, as I indicated, it does not just drive hardware for enterprises, it drives the way they architect their data centers. Data requirement -- keeping data private under control becomes important. So, suddenly, the push of workloads toward public cloud may take a little pause as large enterprises particularly have to take to recognize that you want to run AI workloads, you probably think very hard about running them on-prem and suddenly you push yourself toward saying you got to upgrade your own data centers to do and manage your own data to run it on-prem and that's also pushing a trend that -- we have been seeing now over the past 12 months and hence my comments on VMware Private AI Foundation. This is true, especially enterprises pushing direction are quickly recognizing that how -- where do they run their AI workloads.
So, those are trends we see today and a lot of it coming out of AI, a lot of it coming out of sensitive rules on sovereignty in cloud and data. As far as you mentioning tariffs is concerned, I think that's too early for us to figure out way to online, and probably maybe give it another three, six months, we probably have a better idea of where to go.

Nice. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I want to go back to the XPU side of things. And going from the four new engagements, not yet named customers, to last quarter and two more today that you announced.
I want to talk about going from kind of design win to deployment. How do you judge that? Because there is some debate about tons of design wins, but the deployments actually don't happen either that they never occur or that the volume is never what is originally promised. How do you view that kind of conversion ratio? Is there a wide range around it or is there some way you could help us kind of understand how that works?
Hock E. Tan
--
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
Well, it's -- Ross, that interesting question. I'll take the opportunity to say the way we look at design-win is probably very different from the way many of our peers look at it out there. Number one, to begin with, we believe design win when we know our product is at -- produced in scale, at scale, and is actually deployed, literally deployed in production. So that takes a long lead time because from taping out, getting in the product, it takes a year easily from the product in the hands of our partner to when it goes into scale production, it will take six months to a year is our experience that we've seen, number one.
And number two, I mean, producing and deploying 5,000 XPUs, that's a joke. That's not real production in our view. And so, we also limit ourselves in selecting partners to people who really need that large volume. You need that large volume from our viewpoint in scale right now in mostly training, training of large language models, frontier models in a continuing trajectory.
So, we eliminate ourselves to how many customers or how many potential customers that exist out there, and we tend to be very selective who we pick, to begin with. So, when we say design win, it really is at scale. It's not something that starts in six months and die or a year and die again. Basically, it's a selection of customers.
It's just the way we run our ASIC business in general for the last 15 years. We pick and choose the customers because we know this guy, and we do multi-year roadmaps with these customers because we know these customers are sustainable. I put it bluntly, we don't do it for start-ups.

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go to the three customers that you do have in volume today.

Vivek Arya

Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Hock, whenever you have described your AI opportunity, you have always emphasized the training workload. But the perception is that the AI market could be dominated by the inference workload, especially with these new reasoning models. So, what happens to your opportunity and share if the mix moves more toward inference? Does it -- does it create a bigger SAM for you than the $60 billion to $90 billion? Does it keep it the same, but there is a different mix of product, or does a more inference-heavy market favor a GPU over an XPU? Thank you.
Hock E. Tan
--
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
That's a good question, interesting question. By the way, I never -- I do talk a lot about training. We do -- our chip -- our XPUs also focus on inference as a separate product line. They do.
And that's why I can say the architecture of those chips are very different from the architecture of the training chips. And so, it's a combination of those two, I should add, that adds up to this $60 billion to $90 billion. So, if I had not been clear, I do apologize. It's a combination of both.
But having said that, the larger part of the dollars coming from training, not inference within the service -- of the same that we have talked about so far.

Thanks, Broadcom team, and again, great execution. Just had a quick question. We've been hearing that almost all of the large clusters that are 100K plus they're all going to Ethernet. I was wondering, if you could help us understand the importance of when the customer is making a selection, choosing between a guy that has the best Switch ASIC, such as you, versus a guy that might have the compute there.
Can you talk about what the customer is thinking? And what are the final points that they want to hit upon when they make that selection for the NIC cards?
Hock E. Tan
--
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
OK. ASIC. No, it's a -- yeah, it's down to -- in the case of the hyperscalers now very much so, it's very driven by performance and its performance, what you're mentioning on connecting, scaling up and scaling out those AI accelerators, be they XPU or GPU among hyperscalers. And in most cases, among those hyperscalers we engage with when it comes to connecting those clusters, they are very driven by performance.
I mean, if you are in a race to really get the best performance out of your hardware as you train and continue to train your frontier models, that matters more than anything else. So, the basic first thing they go for is proven. That's a proven piece of hardware. It's a proven that it's a proven system -- subsystem in our case, that makes it work.
And in that case, we tend to have a big advantage because I mean, networking are us. Switching and routing are us, for the last 10 years at least. And the fact that you say AI just makes it more interesting for our engineers to work on. And -- but it's basically based on proven technology and experience in pushing that -- and pushing the envelope on-going from 800-gigabit-per-second bandwidth to 1.6 and moving on 3.2, which is exactly why we keep stepping up this rate of investment in coming up with our products where we take Tomahawk 5, we doubled the RAID X to deal with just one hyperscaler because they want high RAID X to create larger clusters while running bandwidth that are smaller, but that doesn't stop us from moving ahead to the next generation of Tomahawk 6.
And I'd say we're even planning Tomahawk 7 and 8 right now, and we're speeding up the rate of development. And it's all largely for that few guys, by the way. So, we're making a lot of investment for very few customers, hopefully with very large serve the available markets. That's even nothing else that's the big batch we are placing.

Thanks a lot. Hock, in the past, you have mentioned XPU units growing from about 2 million last year to about 7 million you said in the 2027, 2028 timeframe. My question is, do these four new customers, do they add to that 7 million-unit number? I know in the past, you've sort of talked about an ASP of 20 grand by then. So, those -- the first three customers are clearly a subset of that 7 million units.
So, do these new four engagements drive that 7 million higher, or do they just fill in to get to that 7 million? Thanks.

Analyst
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Hock, to follow up on your prepared remarks and comments earlier around optimization with your best hardware and hyperscalers with their great software, I'm curious how you're expanding your portfolio now to six mega-scale kind of frontier models will enable you to, and one blush share tremendous information, but at the same time, a world where these six truly want to differentiate.
So, obviously, the goal for all of these players is exaflops per second per dollar of capex per watt. And I guess to what degree are you aiding them in these efforts? And where does maybe the Chinese wall kind of start where they want to kind of differentiate and not share with you kind of some of the work that you're doing? Thank you.
Hock E. Tan
--
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
We only provide very basic fundamental technology in semiconductors to enable these guys to use what we have and optimize it to their own particular models and algorithms that relate to those models. That's it. That's all we do. So, that's a level of -- a lot of that optimization we do for each of them.
And as I mentioned earlier, there are maybe five degrees of freedom that we do, and we play with them. And so, even if there are five degrees of freedom, there's only so much we can do at that point, but it is -- and how they true -- and basically how we optimize it is all tied to the partner telling us how they want me to do it -- to do it. So, that's only so much we also have visibility on. But it's --what we do now is what the XPU model is.
A sheer optimization translating to performance, but also power. That's very important how they play. It's not just cost, though. Power kind of translates into total cost of ownership eventually.
It's how you design it in power and how we balance it in terms of the size of the cluster and whether they use it for training, pre training, post training, inference, test time scaling. All of them have their own characteristics, and that's the advantage of doing that XPU and working closely with them to create that stuff. Now, as far as your question on China and all that, frankly, I don't have any opinion on that at all. To us, it's a technical game.

I'd love to know just because you have kind of the complete connectivity portfolio, how you see new greenfield scale-up opportunities playing out here between -- could be optical or copper or really anything and what additive this could be for your company? And then, Kirsten, I think opex is up. Maybe just talk about where those opex dollars are going toward within the AI opportunity and whether they relate.
Thanks so much.
Hock E. Tan

President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
Your question is very broad-reaching in our portfolio. Yeah, we deploy -- we have the advantage, and a lot of the customer -- hyperscale customers we deal with, they are talking about a lot of expansion for -- it's almost all greenfield. Less so brownfield. It's very greenfield, it's all expansion, and it all tends to be next generation that we do it, which is very exciting.
So, the opportunity is very, very high. And we deploy -- I mean, we are both -- we can do it in copper, but what we see a lot of opportunity from is when you connect -- provide the networking connectivity through optical. So, there are a lot of active elements including either multi-mode lasers, which are called VCSEL, or edge-emitting lasers for basically single mode. And we do both.
So, there is a lot of opportunity just as in scale -- scale-up versus scale-out. We used to do -- we still do a lot of other protocols beyond Ethernet to consider PCI Express where we are on the leading edge of that PCI Express and the architecture or networking, switching so to speak, we offer both. One is the very intelligent switch, which is like our Jericho family with a dumb NIC, or a very smart NIC with a dumb switch, which is the -- we offer both our architectures as well. So, yeah, we have a lot of opportunities from it.
All things said and done, all this nice white portfolio and all that adds up to probably, as I said in prior quarters, about 20% of our total AI revenue, maybe going to 30%. Though last quarter we hit almost 40%, but that's not the norm. I would say typically, all those other portfolio products still add up to a nice, decent amount of revenue for us, but within the sphere of AI, they add up to, I would say on average, be close to 30%, and the XPU the accelerators is 70%. If that's what you're driving and perhaps I give you some -- shed some light on toward where -- how one matters over the other.
But we have a wide range of products in the connectivity networking side of it. They just add up though to that 30%.

And then on the R&D front, as I outlined, on a consolidated basis, we spent $1.4 billion in R&D in Q1, and I stated that it would be going up in Q2. Hock clearly outlined in his script the two areas where we're focusing on. Now, I would tell you as a company, we focus on R&D across all of our product lines so that we can stay competitive with next-generation product offerings. But he did line out that we are focusing on taping out the industry's first two-nanometer AI XPU packaged in 3D.
That was one in his script, and that's an area that we're focusing on. And then he mentioned that we've doubled the ratings capacity of existing Tomahawk 5 to enable our AI customers to scale up on Ethernet toward the 1 million XPU. So, I mean, that's a huge focus on the company.

And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh

Analyst
Yeah. Hi, Hock. Thanks. Just a quick question on the networking side.
Just wondering how much up sequentially on the AI side. And any thoughts around M&A going forward? Seeing a lot of headlines around the Intel products throughput, etc. Thanks.
Hock E. Tan

President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director
OK. On the networking side, as you indicated, Q1 showed a bit of a surge, but I don't expect that to be that mix of 60-40. 60% is a compute, and 40% networking to be something that is normal. I think the norm is closer to 70-30, maybe at best 30%.
And so, who knows, one, Q2 is -- we kind of see Q2 as continuing, but that's just my mind, a temporary blip. The norm will be 70-30. If you take it across a period of time like six months a year, to answer your question. M&A, no, I'm too busy -- we're too busy doing AI and VMware at this point.
We're not thinking of it at this point.

SUMMARY
Management highlighted that executives provided multi-year roadmap clarity for AI revenue, signaling the current high growth rates could continue into FY2026, based on strong customer visibility and demand for both training and inference workloads. New product cycles, including Tomahawk 6, are supported by what management described as ""tremendous demand."" The company affirmed a stable capital allocation approach, prioritizing dividends, debt repayment, and opportunistic share repurchase, while maintaining significant free cash flow generation.
Despite a sequential uptick in AI networking content, management expects networking's share of AI revenue to decrease to below 30% in FY2026 as custom accelerators ramp up.
Management noted, ""Networking is hard. That doesn't mean XPU is any soft. It's very much along the trajectory we expect it to be."" addressing questions on product mix dynamics within AI semiconductors.
On customer conversion for VMware, Hock Tan said, ""We probably have at least another year plus, maybe a year and a half to go"" in transitioning major accounts to the VCF subscription model.
AI semiconductor demand is increasingly driven by customer efforts to monetize platform investments through inference workloads, with current visibility supporting sustained elevated demand levels.
Kirsten Spears clarified, ""XPU margins are slightly lower than the rest of the business other than Wireless."" which informs guidance for near-term gross margin shifts.
Management stated that near-term growth forecasts do not include potential future contributions from new ""prospects"" beyond active customers; updates will be provided only when revenue conversion is certain.
Hock Tan provided no update on the 2027 AI revenue opportunity, emphasizing that forecasts rest solely on factors and customer activity currently visible to Broadcom Inc.
On regulatory risk, Hock Tan said, ""Nobody can give anybody comfort in this environment,"" in response to questions about prospective impacts of changing export controls on AI product shipments.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Hock Tan:
Thank you, Ji. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q2 2025, total revenue was a record $15 billion, up 20% year on year. This 20% year on year growth was all organic, as Q2 last year was the first full quarter with VMware. Now revenue was driven by continued strength in AI semiconductors and the momentum we have achieved in VMware. Now reflecting excellent operating leverage, Q2 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion, up 35% year on year. Now let me provide more color. Q2 semiconductor revenue was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year on year, up from 11% in Q1.
And of course, driving this growth was AI semiconductor revenue of over $4.4 billion, which was up 46% year on year and continues the trajectory of nine consecutive quarters of strong growth. Within this, custom AI accelerators grew double digits year on year, while AI networking grew over 70% year on year. AI networking, which is based on Ethernet, was robust and represented 40% of our AI revenue. As a standards-based open protocol, Ethernet enables one single fabric for both scale-out and scale-up and remains the preferred choice by our hyperscale customers. Our networking portfolio of Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and NICs is what's driving our success within AI clusters in hyperscale.
And the momentum continues with our breakthrough Tomahawk 6 switch just announced this week. This represents the next generation 102.4 terabits per second switch capacity. Tomahawk 6 enables clusters of more than 100,000 AI accelerators to be deployed in just two tiers instead of three. This flattening of the AI cluster is huge because it enables much better performance in training next-generation frontier models through a lower latency, higher bandwidth, and lower power. Turning to XPUs or customer accelerators, we continue to make excellent progress on the multiyear journey of enabling our three customers and four prospects to deploy custom AI accelerators.
As we had articulated over six months ago, we eventually expect at least three customers to each deploy 1 million AI accelerated clusters in 2027, largely for training their frontier models. And we forecast and continue to do so a significant percentage of these deployments to be custom XPUs. These partners are still unwavering in their plan to invest despite the uncertain economic environment. In fact, what we've seen recently is that they are doubling down on inference in order to monetize their platforms. And reflecting this, we may actually see an acceleration of XPU demand into the back half of 2026 to meet urgent demand for inference on top of the demand we have indicated from training.
And accordingly, we do anticipate now our fiscal 2025 growth rate of AI semiconductor revenue to sustain into fiscal 2026. Turning to our Q3 outlook, as we continue our current trajectory of growth, we forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be $5.1 billion, up 60% year on year, which would be the tenth consecutive quarter of growth. Now turning to non-AI semiconductors in Q2, revenue of $4 billion was down 5% year on year. Non-AI semiconductor revenue is close to the bottom and has been relatively slow to recover. But there are bright spots. In Q2, broadband, enterprise networking, and service storage revenues were up sequentially. However, industrial was down, and as expected, wireless was also down due to seasonality.
We expect enterprise networking and broadband in Q3 to continue to grow sequentially, but server storage, wireless, and industrial are expected to be largely flat. And overall, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue to stay around $4 billion. Now let me talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q2 infrastructure software revenue of $6.6 billion was up 25% year on year, above our outlook of $6.5 billion. As we have said before, this growth reflects our success in converting our enterprise customers from perpetual vSphere to the full VCF software stack subscription.
Customers are increasingly turning to VCF to create a modernized private cloud on-prem, which will enable them to repatriate workloads from public clouds while being able to run modern container-based applications and AI applications. Of our 10,000 largest customers, over 87% have now adopted VCF. The momentum from strong VCF sales over the past eighteen months since the acquisition of VMware has created annual recurring revenue, or otherwise known as ARR, growth of double digits in core infrastructure software. In Q3, we expect infrastructure software revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year on year. So in total, we are guiding Q3 consolidated revenue to be approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year on year.
We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.
Kirsten Spears:
Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q2 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $15 billion for the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Gross margin was 79.4% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on product mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was related to R&D. Q2 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 37% from a year ago, with operating margin at 65% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion or 67% of revenue, above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments.
Starting with semiconductors, revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year on year, driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 56% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was approximately 69%, up 140 basis points year on year, driven by product mix. Operating expenses increased 12% year on year to $971 million on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 57% was up 200 basis points year on year. Now moving on to Infrastructure Software. Revenue for Infrastructure Software of $6.6 billion was up 25% year on year and represented 44% of total revenue.
Gross margin for infrastructure software was 93% in the quarter, compared to 88% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in Infrastructure Software operating margin of approximately 76%. This compares to an operating margin of 60% a year ago. This year-on-year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of VMware. Moving on to cash flow, free cash flow in the quarter was $6.4 billion and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by increased interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and increased cash taxes. We spent $144 million on capital expenditures.
Day sales outstanding were 34 days in the second quarter, compared to 40 days a year ago. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $2 billion, up 6% sequentially in anticipation of revenue growth in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 69 days in Q2, as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the second quarter with $9.5 billion of cash and $69.4 billion of gross principal debt. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid $1.6 billion of debt, resulting in gross principal debt of $67.8 billion. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $59.8 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.8% and seven years, respectively.
The weighted average interest rate and years to maturity of our $8 billion in floating-rate debt is 5.3% and 2.6 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation, in Q2, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share. In Q2, we repurchased $4.2 billion or approximately 25 million shares of common stock. In Q3, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 4.97 billion shares, excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now moving on to guidance, our guidance for Q3 is for consolidated revenue of $15.8 billion, up 21% year on year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $9.1 billion, up 25% year on year.
Within this, we expect Q3 AI Semiconductor revenue of $5.1 billion, up 60% year on year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year on year. For modeling purposes, we expect Q3 consolidated gross margin to be down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher mix of XPUs within AI revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors. We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 and fiscal year 2025 to remain at 14%. And with this, that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.
Operator:
Withdraw your question, please press 11 again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore:
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I wanted to jump onto the AI side, specifically some of the commentary you had about next year. Can you just give a little bit more color on the inference commentary you gave? And is it more the XPU side, the connectivity side, or both that's giving you the confidence to talk about the growth rate that you have this year being matched next fiscal year?
Hock Tan:
Thank you, Ross. Good question. I think we're indicating that what we are seeing and what we have quite a bit of visibility increasingly is increased deployment of XPUs next year and much more than we originally thought. And hand in hand, we did, of course, more and more networking. So it's a combination of both.
Ross Seymore:
In the inference side of things?
Hock Tan:
Yeah. We're seeing much more inference now. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur:
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the quarterly execution. Hock, you know, good to see the positive growth in inflection quarter over quarter. Year over year growth rates in your AI business. As a team, as mentioned, right, the quarters can be a bit lumpy. So if I smooth out kind of first 360% year over year. It's kind of right in line with your three-year kind of SAM growth CAGR. Right? Your prepared remarks and knowing that your lead times remain at thirty-five weeks or better, do you see the Broadcom Inc. team sustaining the 60% year over year growth rate exiting this year?
And I assume that potentially implies that you see your AI business sustaining the 60% year over year growth rate into fiscal 2026 again based on your prepared commentary? Which again is in line with your SAM growth taker. Is that kind of a fair way to think about the trajectory this year and next year?
Hock Tan:
Yeah. Harlan, that's a very insightful set of analysis here, and that's exactly what we're trying to do here because six over six months ago, we gave you guys a point a year 2027. As we come into the second now into the second half, of 2025, and with improved visibility and updates we are seeing in the way our hyperscale partners are deploying data centers, AI clusters, we are providing you more some level of guidance, visibility, what we are seeing how the trajectory of '26 might look like. I'm not giving you any update on '27. We just still establishing the update we have in '27, months ago.
But what we're doing now is giving you more visibility into where we're seeing '26 head.
Harlan Sur:
But is the framework that you laid out for us, like, second half of last year, which implies 60% kind of growth CAGR in your SAM opportunity. Is that kind of the right way to think about it as it relates to the profile of growth in your business this year and next year?
Hock Tan:
Yes.
Harlan Sur:
Okay. Thank you, Hock.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ben Reitzis with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Ben Reitzis:
Hey. How are doing? Thanks, guys. Hey, Hock. Networking AI networking was really strong in the quarter. And it seemed like it must have beat expectations. I was wondering if you could just talk about the networking in particular, what caused that and how much is that is your acceleration into next year? And when do you think you see Tomahawk kicking in as part of that acceleration? Thanks.
Hock Tan:
Well, I think the network AI networking, as you probably would know, goes pretty hand in hand with deployment of AI accelerated clusters. It isn't. It doesn't deploy on a timetable that's very different from the way the accelerators get deployed, whether they are XPUs or GPUs. It does happen. And they deploy a lot in scale-out where Ethernet, of course, is the choice of protocol, but it's also increasingly moving into the space of what we all call scale-up within those data centers. Where you have much higher, more than we originally thought consumption or density of switches than you have in the scale-out scenario.
It's in fact, the increased density in scale-up is five to 10 times more than in scale-out. That's the part that kind of pleasantly surprised us. And which is why this past quarter Q2, the AI networking portion continues at about 40% from when we reported a quarter ago for Q1. And, at that time, I said, I expect it to drop.
Ben Reitzis:
And your thoughts on Tomahawk driving acceleration for next year and when it kicks in?
Hock Tan:
Oh, six. Oh, yeah. That's extremely strong interest now. We're not shipping big orders or any orders other than basic proof of concepts out to customers. But there is tremendous demand for this new 102 terabit per second Tomahawk switches.
Ben Reitzis:
Thanks, Hock.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis:
Hey. Thanks, and results. I just wanted to ask maybe following up on the scale-out opportunity. So today, I guess, your main customer is not really using an NVLink switch style scale-up. I'm just kinda curious your visibility or the timing in terms of when you might be shipping, you know, a switched Ethernet scale-up network to your customers?
Hock Tan:
The talking scale-up? Scale-up.
Blayne Curtis:
Scale-up.
Hock Tan:
Yeah. Well, scale-up is very rapidly converting to Ethernet now. Very much so. It's I for our fairly narrow band of hyperscale customers, scale-up is very much Ethernet.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon:
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hock, I still wanted to follow-up on that AI 2026 question. I wanna just put some numbers on it. Just to make sure I've got it right. So if you did 60% in the 360% year over year in Q4, puts you at, like, I don't know, $5.8 billion, something like $19 or $20 billion for the year. And then are you saying you're gonna grow 60% in 2026, which would put you $30 billion in AI revenues for 2026. I just wanna make is that the math that you're trying to communicate to us directly?
Hock Tan:
I think you're doing the math. I'm giving you the trend. But I did answer that question. I think Harlan may have asked earlier. The rate we are seeing and now so far in fiscal 2025 and will presumably continue. We don't see any reason why it doesn't give an time. Visibility in '25. What we're seeing today based on what we have visibility on '26 is to be able to ramp up this AI revenue in the same trajectory. Yes.
Stacy Rasgon:
So is the SAM going up as well? Because now you have inference on top of training. So is the SAM still 60 to 90, or is the SAM higher now as you see it?
Hock Tan:
I'm not playing the SAM game here. I'm just giving a trajectory towards where we drew the line on 2027 before. So I have no response to it's the SAM going up or not. Stop talking about SAM now. Thanks.
Stacy Rasgon:
Oh, okay. Thank you.
Operator:
One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya:
Thanks for taking my question. I had a near and then a longer term on the XPU business. So, Hock, for near term, if your networking upsided in Q2, and overall AI was in line, it means XPU was perhaps not as strong. So I realize it's lumpy, but anything more to read into that, any product transition or anything else? So just a clarification there. And then longer term, you know, you have outlined a number of additional customers that you're working with. What milestones should we look forward to, and what milestones are you watching to give you the confidence that you can now start adding that addressable opportunity into your 2027 or 2028 or other numbers?
Like, how do we get the confidence that these projects are going to turn into revenue in some, you know, reasonable time frame from now? Thank you.
Hock Tan:
Okay. On the first part that you are asking, it's you know, it's like you're trying to be you're trying to count how many angels on a head of a pin. I mean, whether it's XPU or networking, Networking is hard. That doesn't mean XPU is any soft. It's very much along the trajectory we expect it to be. And there's no lumpiness. There's no softening. It's pretty much what we expect. The trajectory to go so far. And into next quarter as well, and probably beyond. So we have a fair it's a fairly I guess, in our view, fairly clear visibility on the short-term trajectory. In terms of going on to 2027, no.
We are not updating any numbers here. We six months ago, we drew a sense for the size of the SAM based on, you know, million XPU clusters for three customers. And that's still very valid at that point. That you'll be there. But and we have not provided any further updates here. Nor are we intending to at this point. When we get a better visibility clearer, sense of where we are, and that probably won't happen until 2026. We'll be happy to give an update to the audience.
But right now, though, to in today's prepared remarks and answering a couple of questions, we are as we are doing as we have done here, we are intending to give you guys more visibility what we've seen the growth trajectory in 2026.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
CJ Muse:
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to follow-up on Ross' question regarding inference opportunity. You discuss workloads that are optimal that you're seeing for custom silicon? And that over time, what percentage of your XPU business could be inference versus training? Thank you.
Hock Tan:
I think there's no differentiation between training and inference in using merchant accelerators versus customer accelerators. I think that all under the whole premise behind going towards custom accelerators continues. Which is not a matter of cost alone. It is that as custom accelerators get used and get developed on a road map with any particular hyperscaler, that's a learning curve. A learning curve on how they could optimize the way they'll go as the algorithms on their large language models get written and tied to silicon. And that ability to do so is a huge value added in creating algorithms that can drive their LLMs to higher and higher performance.
Much more than basically a segregation approach between hardware and the software. It says you literally combine end-to-end hardware and software as they take that. As they take that journey. And it's a journey. They don't learn that in one year. Do it a few cycles, get better and better at it. And then lies the value, the fundamental value in creating your own hardware versus using silicon. A third-party merchant that you are able to optimize your software to the hardware and eventually achieve way higher performance than you otherwise could. And we see that happening.

Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Karl Ackerman:
Yes. Thank you. Hock, you spoke about the much higher content opportunity in scale-up networking. I was hoping you could discuss how important is demand adoption for co-package optics in achieving this five to 10x higher content for scale-up networks. Or should we anticipate much of the scale-up opportunity will be driven by Tomahawk and Thor and NICs? Thank you.
Hock Tan:
I'm trying to decipher this question of yours, so let me try to answer it perhaps in a way I think you want me to clarify. First and foremost, I think most of what's scaling up there are a lot of the scaling up that's going in, as I call it, which means a lot of XPU or GPU to GPU interconnects. It's done on copper. Copper interconnects. And because, you know, there's the size of the size of this in of this scale-up cluster still not that huge yet, that you can get away with. Copper to using copper interconnects. And they're still doing it. Mostly, they're doing it today.
At some point soon, I believe, when you start trying to go beyond maybe 72, GPU to GPU, interconnects, you may have to push towards a different protocol by protocol mode at a different meeting. From copper to optical. And when we do that, yeah, perhaps then things like exotic stuff like co-packaging might be a fault of silicon with optical might become relevant. But truly, what we really are talking about is that at some stage, as the clusters get larger, which means scale-up becomes much bigger, you need to interconnect GPU or XPU to each other in scale-up many more.
Than just 72 or 100 maybe even 28, you start going more and more, you want to use optical interconnects simply because of distance. And that's when optical will start replacing copper. And when that happens, the question is what's the best way to deliver on optical. And one way is co-packaged optics. But it's not the only way. You can just simply use continue use, perhaps pluggable. At low-cost optics. In which case then you can interconnect the bandwidth, the radix of a switch and our switch is down 512 connections. You can now connect all these XPUs GPUs, 512 for scale-up phenomenon. And that was huge. But that's when you go to optical.
That's going to happen within my view a year or two. And we'll be right in the forefront of it. And it may be co-packaged optics, which we are very much in development, it's a lock-in. Co-package, or it could just be as a first step pluggable object. Whatever it is, I think the bigger question is, when does it go from optical and from copper connecting GPU to GPU to optical. Connecting it. And the stamp in that move will be huge. And it's not necessary for package updates, though that definitely one path we are pursuing.
Karl Ackerman:
Very clear. Thank you.
Operator:
And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Joshua Buchalter:
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Realized the nitpicky, but I wanted to ask about gross margins in the guide. So your revenue implies sort of $800 million and $100 million incremental increase with gross profit up, I think, $400 million to $450 million, which is kind of pretty well below corporate average fall through. Appreciate that semis are dilutive, and custom is probably dilutive within semis, but anything else going on with margins that we should be aware of? And how should we think about the margin profile of longer term as that business continues to scale and diversify? Thank you.
Kirsten Spears:
Yes. We've historically said that the XPU margins are slightly lower than the rest of the business other than Wireless. So there's really nothing else going on other than that. It's just exactly what I said. That the majority of it quarter over quarter. Is the 30 basis point decline is being driven by more XPUs.
Hock Tan:
You know, there are more moving parts here. Than your simple analysis pros here. And I think your simple analysis is totally wrong in that regard.
Joshua Buchalter:
And thank you.
Operator:
And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri:
Thanks a lot. I also wanted to ask about Scale-Up, Hock. So there's a lot of competing ecosystems. There's UA Link, which, of course, you left. And now there's the big, you know, GPU company, you know, opening up NVLink. And they're both trying to build ecosystems. And there's an argument that you're an ecosystem of one. What would you say to that debate? Does opening up NVLink change the landscape? And sort of how do you view your AI networking growth next year? Do you think it's gonna be primarily driven by scale-up or would still be pretty scale-out heavy? Thanks.
Hock Tan:
It's you know, people do like to create platforms. And new protocols and systems. The fact of the matter is scale-up. It can just be done easily, and it's currently available. It's open standards open source, Ethernet. Just as well just as well, don't need to create new systems for the sake of doing something that you could easily be doing in networking in Ethernet. And so, yeah, I hear a lot of this interesting new protocols standards that are trying to be created. And most of them, by the way, are proprietary. Much as they like to call it otherwise. One is really open source, and open standards is Ethernet.
And we believe Ethernet won't prevail as it does before for the last twenty years in traditional networking. There's no reason to create a new standard for something that could be easily done in transferring bits and bytes of data.
Timothy Arcuri:
Got it, Alex. Thank you.
Operator:
And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Christopher Rolland:
Thanks for the question. Yeah. My question is for you, Hock. It's a kind of a bigger one here. And this kind of acceleration that we're seeing in AI demand, do you think that this acceleration is because of a marked improvement in ASICs or XPUs closing the gap on the software side at your customers? Do you think it's these require tokenomics around inference, test time compute driving that, for example? What do you think is actually driving the upside here? And do you think it leads to a market share shift faster than we were expecting towards XPU from GPU? Thanks.
Hock Tan:
Yeah. Interesting question. But no. None of the foregoing that you outlined. So it's simple. The way inference has come out, very, very hot lately is remember, we're only selling to a few customers, hyperscalers with platforms and LLMs. That's it. They are not that many. And you we told you how many we have. And haven't increased any. But what is happening is this all on this hyperscalers and those with LLMs need to justify all the spending they're doing. Doing training makes your frontier model smarter. That's no question. Almost like science. Research and science. Make your frontier models by creating very clever algorithm that deep, consumes a lot of compute for training smarter. Training makes us smarter.
Want to monetize inference. And that's what's driving it. Monetize, I indicated in my prepared remarks. The drive to justify a return on investment and a lot of the investment is training. And then return on investment is by creating use cases a lot AI use cases AI consumption, out there, through availability of a lot of inference. And that's what we are now starting to see among a small group of customers.
Christopher Rolland:
Excellent. Thank you.
Operator:
And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh:
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, Hock. Just going back on the AI server revenue side. I know you said fiscal 2025 kind of tracking to that up 60% ish growth. If you look at fiscal 2026, you have many new customers ramping a meta and probably, you know, you have the four of the six. Hyper skills that you're talking to past. Would you expect that growth to activate into fiscal 2026? If all that, you know, kind of the 60% you had talked about.
Hock Tan:
You know, my prepared remarks, which I clarify, that the grade of growth we are seeing in 2025 will sustain into 2026. Based on improved visibility and the fact that we're seeing inference coming in on top of the demand for training as the clusters get built up again because it still stands. I don't think we are getting very far by trying to pass through my words or data here. It's just a and we see that going from 2025 into 2026 as the best forecast we have at this point.
Vijay Rakesh:
Got it. And on the NVLink the NVLink fusion versus the scale-up, do you expect that market to go the route of top of the rack where you've seen some move to the Internet side in kind of scale-out? Do you expect scale-up to kind of go the same route? Thanks.
Hock Tan:
Well, Broadcom Inc. does not participate in NVLink. So I'm really not qualified to answer that question, I think.
Vijay Rakesh:
Got it. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers:
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Think all my questions on scale-up have been asked. But I guess Hock, given the execution that you guys have been able to do with the VMware integration, looking at the balance sheet, looking at the debt structure. I'm curious if, you know, if you could give us your thoughts on how the company thinks about capital return versus the thoughts on M&A and the strategy going forward? Thank you.
Hock Tan:
Okay. That's an interesting question. And I agree. Not too untimely, I would say. Because, yeah, we have done a lot of the integration of VMware now. And you can see that in the level of free cash flow we're generating from operations. And as we said, the use of capital has always been, we're very I guess, measured and upfront with a return through dividends which is half our free cash flow of the preceding year. And frankly, as Kirsten has mentioned, three months ago and six months ago too in the last two earnings call, the first choice typically of the other free a part of the free cash flow is to bring down our debt.
To a more to a level that we feel closer to no more than two. Ratio of debt to EBITDA. And that doesn't mean that opportunistically, we may go out there and buy back our shares. As we did last quarter. And indicated by Kirsten we did $4.2 billion of stock buyback. Now part of it is used to basically when RS employee, RSUs vest basically use we basically buy back part of the shares in used to be paying taxes on the invested RSU.
But the other part of it, I do a I do a main we use it opportunistically last quarter when we see an opportune situation when basically, we think that it's a good time to buy some shares back. We do. But having said all that, our use of cash outside the dividends would be, at this stage, used towards reducing our debt. And I know you're gonna ask, what about M&A? Well, kind of M&A we will do will, in our view, would be significant, would be substantial enough that we need debt. In any case.
And it's a good and it's a good use of our free cash flow to bring down debt to, in a way, expand, if not preserve our borrowing capacity if we have to do another M&A deal.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Srini Pajjuri:
Thank you. Hock, couple of clarifications. First, on your 2026 expectation, are you assuming any meaningful contribution from the four prospects that you talked about?
Hock Tan:
No comment. We don't talk on prospects. We only talk on customers.
Srini Pajjuri:
Okay. Fair enough. And then my other clarification is that I think you talked about networking being about 40% of the mix within AI. Is it the right kind of mix that you expect going forward? Or is that going to materially change as we, I guess, see XPUs ramping, you know, going forward.
Hock Tan:
No. I've always said, and I expect that to be the case in going forward in 2026 as we grow. That networking should be a ratio to XPU should be closer in the range of less than 30%. Not the 40%.
Operator:
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph Moore:
Great. Thank you. You've said you're not gonna be impacted by export controls on AI. I know there's been a number of changes since in the industry since the last time you made the call. Is that still the case? And just know, can you give people comfort that you're there's no impact from that down the road?
Hock Tan:
Nobody can give anybody comfort in this environment, Joe. You know that. Rules are changing quite dramatically as trade bilateral trade agreements continue to be negotiated in a very, very dynamic environment. So I'll be honest, I don't I don't know. I know as little as probably you probably know more than I do maybe. In which case then I know very little about this whole thing about whether there's any export control, how the export control will take place we're guessing. So I rather not answer that because no, I know. Whether it will be.
Operator:
Thank you. And we do have time for one final question. And that will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
William Stein:
Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about VMware. Can you comment as to how far along you are in the process of converting customers to the subscription model? Is that close to complete? Or is there still a number of quarters that we should expect that conversion continues?
Hock Tan:
That's a good question. And so let me start off by saying, a good way to measure it is you know, most of our VMware contracts are about three on it. Typically, three years. And that was what VMware did before we acquired them. And that's pretty much what we continue to do. Three is very traditional. So based on that, the renewals, like, two-thirds of the way, almost to the halfway more than halfway through the renewals. We probably have at least another year plus, maybe a year and a half to go.
Ji Yoo:
Thank you. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo for closing remarks. Thank you, operator. Broadcom Inc. currently plans to report earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 after the close of market on Thursday, September 4, 2025. A public webcast of Broadcom Inc.'s earnings conference call will follow at 2 PM Pacific. That will conclude our earnings call today. Thank you all for joining. Operator, you may end the call."

Full Conference Call Transcript
Hock Tan:
And thank you everyone for joining us today. Well, we just ended our Q4 fiscal 2025. And before I get into details of that quarter, let me recap the year. In our fiscal 2025, consolidated revenue grew 24% year over year, to a record $64 billion, driven by AI semiconductors and VMware. AI revenue grew 65% year over year to $20 billion, driving the semiconductor revenue for this company to a record $37 billion for the year. In our infrastructure software business, strong adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation, or VCF as we call it, drove revenue growth of 26% year on year to $27 billion. In summary, 2025 was another strong year for Broadcom.
And we see the spending momentum by our customers for AI continuing to accelerate in 2026. Now let's move on to the results of our fourth quarter 2025. Total revenue was a record $18 billion, up 28% year on year and above our guidance on better than expected growth in AI semiconductors as well as infrastructure software. Q4 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record $12.12 billion, up 34% year on year. So let me give you more color on our two segments. In semiconductors, revenue was $11.1 billion as year on year growth accelerated to 35%. This robust growth was driven by AI semiconductor revenue of $6.5 billion, which was up 74% year on year.
This represents a growth trajectory exceeding 10 times over the eleven quarters we have reported this line of business. Our customer accelerated business more than doubled year over year as we see our customers increase adoption of XPUs, as we call those customer accelerators, in training their LLMs and monetizing their platforms through inferencing APIs and applications. These XPUs, I may add, are not only being used to train and inference internal workloads by our customers. The same experience in some situations has been extended externally to other LLM peers. Best exemplified at Google where the TPUs used in creating Gemini are also being used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Cohere, and SSI as a sample.
The scale at which we see this happening could be significant. As you are aware, last quarter, Q3 2025, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU ironwood racks to Anthropic. This was our fourth custom. That we mentioned. In this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from this same customer for delivery in late 2026. But that does not mean our other two customers are using TPUs. In fact, they prefer to control their own destiny by continuing to drive their multiyear journey to create their own custom AI accelerators or XPU RECs as we call them.
I am pleased today to report that during this quarter, we acquired a fifth XPU customer through a $1 billion order placed for delivery in late 2026. Now moving on to AI networking. Demand here has even been stronger as we see customers build out their data center infrastructure ahead of deploying AI accelerators. Our current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as our latest 102 terabyte terabit per second Tomahawk six switch, the first and only one of its capability out there, continues to book at record rates. This is just a subset of what we have.
We have also secured record orders on DSPs, optical components like lasers, and PCI Express switches to be deployed in AI data centers. All these components combined with our XPUs bring our total order on hand in excess of $73 billion today, which is almost half Broadcom's consolidated backlog of $162 billion. We expect this $73 billion in AI backlog to be delivered over the next eighteen months. In Q1 fiscal 2026, we expect our AI revenue to double year on year to $8.2 billion. Turning to non-AI semiconductors, Q4 revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year on year and up 16% sequentially based on favorable wireless seasonality. Year on year, broadband showed solid recovery. Wireless was flat.
All the other end markets were down as enterprise spending continued to show limited signs of recovery. Accordingly, in Q1, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue to be approximately $4.1 billion, flat from a year ago, down sequentially due to wireless seasonality. Let me now talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q4 Infrastructure Software revenue of $6.9 billion was up 19% year on year, both and above our outlook of 6.7. Bookings continued to be strong, as total contract value booked in Q4 exceeded $10.4 billion versus $8.2 billion a year ago. We ended the year with $73 billion of infrastructure software backlog, up from $49 billion a year ago.
We expect renewals to be seasonal in Q1 and forecast infrastructure software revenue to be approximately $6.8 billion. We still expect, however, that for fiscal 2026, Infrastructure Software revenue to grow low double-digit percentage. So here's what we see in 2026. Directionally, we expect AI revenue to continue to accelerate and drive most of our growth. Non-AI semiconductor revenue to be stable. Infrastructure software revenue will continue to be driven by VMware growth at low double digits. For Q1 2026, we expect consolidated revenue of approximately $19.1 billion, up 28% year on year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 67% of revenue. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.
Kirsten Spears:
Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $18 billion for the quarter, up 28% from a year ago. Gross margin was 77.9% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher software revenues and product mix within semiconductors. Consolidated operating expenses were $2.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was research and development. Q4 operating income was a record $11.9 billion, up 35% from a year ago. Now on a sequential basis, even as gross margin was down 50 basis points on semiconductor product mix, operating margin increased 70 basis points sequentially to 66.2% on favorable operating leverage.
Adjusted EBITDA of $12.12 billion or 68% of revenue was above our guidance of 67%. This figure excludes $148 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was a record $11.1 billion with growth accelerating to 35% year on year driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 61% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was approximately 68%. Operating expenses increased 16% year on year, to $1.1 billion on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 59% was up 250 basis points year on year. Now moving to infrastructure software.
Revenue for Infrastructure Software of $6.9 billion was up 19% year on year and represented 39% of total revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 93% in the quarter compared to 91% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in Infrastructure Software operating margin of 78%. This compares to operating margin of 72% a year ago reflecting the completion of the integration of VMware. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $7.5 billion and represented 41% of revenue. We spent $237 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were thirty-six days in the fourth quarter, compared to twenty-nine days a year ago.
We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $2.3 billion, up 4% sequentially. Our days of inventory on hand were fifty-eight days in Q4, compared to sixty-six days in Q3 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the fourth quarter with $16.2 billion of cash, up $5.5 billion sequentially on strong cash flow generation. The weighted average coupon rate in years to maturity of our gross principal fixed rate debt of $67.1 billion is 4% and 7.2 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. In Q4, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share.
In Q1, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 4.97 billion shares excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2025. Our revenue hit a record $63.9 billion with organic growth accelerating to 24% year on year. Semiconductor revenue was $36.9 billion, up 22% year over year. Infrastructure software revenue was $27 billion, up 26% year on year. Fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA was $43 billion and represented 67% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 39% year on year to $26.9 billion. For fiscal 2025, we returned $17.5 billion of cash to shareholders in the form of $11.1 billion of dividends and $6.4 billion in share repurchases and eliminations.
Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2026 to 65¢ per share, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal 2026, subject to quarterly board approval. This implies our fiscal 2026 annual common stock dividend to be a record $2.60 per share, an increase of 10% year on year. I would like to highlight that this represents the fifteenth consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011.
The board also approved an extension of our share repurchase program of which $7.5 billion remains, through the end of calendar year 2026. Now moving to guidance. Our guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $19.1 billion, up 28% year on year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $12.3 billion, up 50% year on year. Within this, we expect Q1 AI semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion, up approximately 100% year on year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.8 billion, up 2% year on year. For your modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 100 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher mix of AI revenue.
As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors and also product mix within semiconductor. Expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 67%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 and fiscal year 2026 to increase from 14% to approximately 6.5% due to the impact of the global minimum tax and shift in geographic mix of income compared to that of fiscal year 2025. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we come to our first question.
Vivek Arya:
Our first question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Hock Tan:
Thank you. Just wanted to clarify, Hock, you said $73 billion over eighteen months for AI. That's, you know, roughly $50 billion plus for fiscal 2026. For AI. I just wanted to make sure I got that right. And then the main question, Hock, is that there is sort of this emerging debate about customer-owned tooling. You know, your async customers potentially wanting to do more things on their own. How do you see your XPU content and share at your largest customer evolve over the next one or two years? Thank you.
Hock Tan:
Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place, account of XPU switches, DSPs, lasers, for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next eighteen months. And obviously, this is as of now. I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so do not take that $73 billion as that's the revenue we ship over the next eighteen months. Just saying we have that now, and then the bookings have been accelerating. And frankly, we see that bookings not just in XPUs, but in switches, DSPs, all the other components that go into AI data centers.
We have never seen bookings of the nature that what we have seen over the past three months. Particularly, with respect to Taiwan six switches. This is one of the fastest-growing products in terms of deployment that we have ever seen. Of any switch product that we put out there. It is pretty interesting. And partly because it's the only one of its kind out there at this point. At 102 terabit per second. And that's the exact product needed to expand the clusters of the latest GPU and XPUs out there. No. That's great. But as far as what is the future as XPU is your broader question.
My answer to you is do not follow what you hear out there as gospel. It's a trajectory. It's a multiyear journey. And many of the players and not too many players doing LLMs want to do their own custom AI accelerator for very good reasons. You can put in hardware what if you use a general-purpose GPU you can only do in software and kernels in software. You can achieve performance-wise so much better in the custom-purpose design hardware-driven XPU. And we see that in the TPU and we see that in all the accelerators we are doing for other customers. Much better in areas of sparse call, training, inference, reasoning, all that stuff.
Now will that mean that over time, they all want to go do it themselves?
Operator:
Not necessarily.
Hock Tan:
And in fact, because the technology in silicon keeps updating, keeps evolving. And if you are an LLM player, where do you put your resources in order to compete in this space? Especially when you have to compete at the end of the day against merchant GPU. Who are not slowing down in their rate of evolution. So I see that as this concept of customer tooling is an overblown hypothesis which frankly I do not think will happen. Thank you.
Operator:
And that will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore:
Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I wanted to go to something you touched on earlier about the TPUs going a little bit more to like a merchant go-to-market to other customers. Do you believe that's the substitution effect for customers who otherwise would have done ASICs with you, or do you think it's actually broadening the market? And so what are kind of the financial implications of that from your perspective?
Hock Tan:
That's a very good question, Ross. And what we see right now is the most obvious move it does is it goes to the people who use TPUs. The alternative is GPUs, merchant basis. That's the most common thing that happens. Because to do that substitution for another custom, it's different. To make an investment in a custom accelerator is a multiyear journey. It's a strict directional thing. It's not necessarily a very transactional or short-term move. Moving from GPU to TPU is a transactional move.
Going into an AI accelerator of your own is a long-term strategic move and nothing would deter you from there to continue to make that investment towards that end goal of successfully creating and deploying your own custom AI accelerator. So that's the motion we see.
Ross Seymore:
Thank you.
Operator:
And that will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur:
Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results, guidance, and execution. Hock, again, I just want to sort of verify this. Right? So you talked about total AI backlog of $73 billion over the next six quarters. Right? This is just a snap of your order book, like, right now. But given your lead times, I think customers can and still will place orders for AI in quarters four, five, and six. So as time moves forward, that backlog number for more shipments in '26 will probably still go up. Right? Is that the correct interpretation?
And then given the strong and growing backlog, right, the question is does the team have three nanometer, two nanometer wafer supply, COA substrate, HBM supply commitments to support all of the demand in your order book and I know one of the areas where you are trying to mitigate this is in advanced packaging. Right? You're bringing up your Singapore facility. You guys just remind us what part of the advanced packaging process the team is focusing on with the Singapore facility? Thanks.
Hock Tan:
Thanks. Well, to answer your first simpler question, you're right. You can say that $73 billion is the backlog we have today. To ship over the next six quarters. You might also say that and given our lead time, we expect more orders to be able to be absorbed into our backlog for shipments over the next six quarters. So take it that we expect revenue a minimum revenue, one way to look at it, of $73 billion over the next six quarters. But we do expect much more as more orders come in. For shipments within the next six quarters. Yeah.
Our lead time depending on the particular product it is, can be anywhere from six months to a year. On with respect to supply chain is what you're asking critical supply chain on silicon. Yeah. And packaging. Yeah. That's an interesting challenge that we have been addressing over for constantly and continue to. And with the strength of the demand and the need for more innovative packaging, advanced packaging, because you are talking about multi chips multi chips in creating every customer accelerator now. The packaging becomes a very interesting and technical challenge. And building our Singapore fab is to really talk about partially insourcing those advanced packaging.
We believe that we have enough demand we can literally insource not from the viewpoint of not just cost, but in the viewpoint of supply chain security and delivery. And we're building up a fairly substantial facility for packaging advanced packaging, Singapore as indicated. Purely for that purpose to address the package advanced packaging site. Silicon wise, now we go back to the same pressure source in Taiwan, TSMC. And so we keep going for more and more capacity in two nanometers, three nanometers, and so far, we do not have that constraint. But again, time will tell as we progress and as our backlog builds up. Thank you.
Operator:
The next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis:
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask with the original $10 billion deal, you talked about a rack sale. I just wanted to with the follow-on order as well as the fifth customer, can you just maybe describe how you're gonna deliver those? Is it an XPU, or is it a rack? And then maybe you can kinda just walk us through the math and kinda what the deliverable is. Obviously, Google uses its own networking, so I'm kinda curious too. Would it be a copy exactly what Google does? That you could talk to it to name? Or would you have your own networking there as well?
Hock Tan:
Thanks. That's a very complicated question, Blayne. Let me tell you what it is. It's a system sale. How about that? It's a real system sale. We have so many components beyond XPUs, customer accelerators, in or any system, in AI system, any AI system, used by hyperscalers that, yeah, we believe it begins to make sense to do it as a system sales and be responsive but be fully responsible for the entire system or rack as you call it. I think people understand it as a system still better. And so on this customer number four, we are selling it as a system with our key components in it. And that's no different than selling a chip.
We certify a final ability to run as part of the wholesale selling process.
Operator:
And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon:
Wanted to touch on gross margins and maybe it feeds into a little bit of prior question. So I understand why the AI business is somewhat dilutive to gross margins. We have the HPM pass-through. And then presumably with the system sales, that will be more diluted. And you've hinted at this in the past, but I was wondering if you could be a little more explicit. As this AI revenue starts to ramp, as we start to get system sales, how should we be thinking about that gross margin number, say, if we're looking out, you know, four quarters or six quarters, is it low 70s? I mean, could it start with a six at the corporate level?
And I guess I'm also wondering I understand how that comes down, but what about the operating margins? Do you think you get enough operating leverage on the OpEx side to keep operating margins flat, or do they need to come down as well?
Hock Tan:
I'll let Kirsten give you the details, enough for me to broadly high level explain to you stating good question. Phenomenal. You don't see that impacting us right now, and we have already started that process. Of some system sales. You don't see that in our numbers, but it worked. And we have said that openly. The AI revenue has a lower gross margin than our obviously, the rest of the business, including software, of course.
But we expect the rate of growth to offer as we do more and more AI revenue to be so much that we get the operating leverage on our operating spending that operating margin won't deliver dollars that are still a high level of growth from what it has been. So we expect operating leverage to benefit us at the operating margin level even as gross margin will start to deteriorate. High level.
Kirsten Spears:
No. I think Hock said that fairly. And the second half of the year when we do start shipping more systems, the situation is straightforward. We'll be passing through more components that are not ours. So think of it similar to the XPUs where we have memory on those XPUs, we're passing through those costs. We'll be passing through more costs within the rack. And so those gross margins will be lower. However, overall, the way Hock said it, gross margin dollars will go up. Margins will go down. Operating margins, because we have leverage, operating margin dollars will go up, but the margin itself, a percentage of revenues will come down a bit.
But we're not I mean, we'll guide closer to you know, the end of the year for that.
Stacy Rasgon:
Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator:
One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jim Schneider:
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, I was wondering if you might care to calibrate your expectations for AI revenue in fiscal 2026 a little bit more closely. I believe you talked about acceleration in fiscal 2026 off of the 65% growth rate you did in fiscal 2025. And then you're guiding to 100% growth for Q1. So I'm just wondering if the Q1 is a good jumping-off point for the growth rate you expect for the full year something maybe a little bit less than that? And then maybe if you could separately clarify whether your $1 billion of orders for the fifth customer is indeed OpenAI, which you made a separate announcement about. Thank you.
Hock Tan:
Wow. There's a lot of question here. But let me start off with 2026. You know, our backlog is very dynamic these days. As I said. And it is continuing to ramp up. And you're right. We originally, six months ago said maybe year on year, AI revenues would grow in 2026 sixty, 70%. Q1, we doubled. And Q1 2026, today, we're saying it doubled. And when we're looking at it, because all the fresh orders keep coming in, and we give you a milestone of where we are today. Which is $73 billion of backlog to be shipped over the next eighteen months.
And we do fully expect as I answered the earlier question, for that $73 billion over the eighteen months, to keep growing, Now it's a moving target. It's a moving number as we move in time. But it will grow. And it's hard for me to pinpoint what 2026 is going to look like precisely. I rather not give you guys any guidance, and that's why we don't give you guidance. But we do give it for Q1. Give it time or give it till Q2, and you're right. It's saying that to us, is it an accelerating trend? And my answer is it's likely to be an accelerating trend. As we progress through 2026. Hope that answers. Your question.
Jim Schneider:
Yes. Thank you.
Operator:
One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.
Ben Reitzes:
Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Hey, Hock. I wanted to ask I'm not sure if the last caller said something on it, but I didn't hear it in the answer was wanted to ask about the OpenAI contract that it's supposed to start in the second half of the year and go through 2029 for 10 gigawatts. I'm gonna assume that's the that's the fifth customer order there. And I was just wondering if you're still confident in that being a driver. Are there any obstacles to making that a major driver? And when you expect, you know, that to contribute? And your confidence in it. Thanks so much, Hock.
Hock Tan:
You didn't hear that answer from my last caller, Jim's question was because I did not answer it I'm not answering it either. The fifth customer. And he's a real customer and he will grow. They are on their multi-year journey to their own XPUs. And let's leave it at that. As far as the OpenAI view that you have, I we appreciate the fact that it is a multiyear journey. That will run through '29 as our press release with OpenAI showed. 10 gigawatts between '26 to more like '27, 28. 29. Ben. Not 26. It's more like 27, 28, 29, 10 gigawatts. That was the OpenAI discussion.
And that's I call it an agreement, an alignment where we're headed with respect to a various respected and valued customer OpenAI.
Ben Reitzes:
But that's real interesting.
Hock Tan:
We do not expect March in '26. Ah, okay. That's thanks for clarifying that. That's really interesting. Appreciate it.
Operator:
One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
CJ Muse:
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Hock, I wanted to talk about custom silicon and maybe speak to how you expect content to grow for broad generation to generation. And as part of that, you know, your competitor announced CPX offering essentially accelerator for an accelerator for massive context windows. I'm curious if you see it a broadening opportunity you know, for your existing five customers to have multiple XPU offerings. Thanks so much.
Hock Tan:
Thank you. No. Yeah. It's you hit it right on. I mean, the nice thing about a custom accelerator is you try not to do one size fits all. And do and generationally. Each of these five customers now can create their version of chip of an XPU customer accelerator for training. And inference. And it basically is almost two parallel tracks going on almost simultaneously for each of them. So I would have plenty of versions to deal with. I do not need to create any more version. We got plenty of different content out there. Just on the basis of creating these customer accelerators.
And by the way, when you do customer accelerators, you tend to put more hardware in that unique differentiated versus trying to make it work on software. And creating kernels into software. I know that's very tricky too. But think about the difference where you can create in hardware those sparse call data routers. Versus the dense matrix multipliers all in one same chip. And that's one of many one of just one example of what creating customer accelerators is letting us do.
Over that matter, a variation in how much memory capacity or memory bandwidth from for the same customer from chip to chip just because even in inference, want to do more reasoning, first decoding, versus something else, like prefilled. So you literally start to create different hardware for different and run your workloads. aspect of how you want to train or inference It's a very fascinating area. And we are seeing a lot of variations and multiple chips. For each of our customers. Thank you.
Operator:
One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar:
Yeah, Hock and team. First of all, congratulations on some pretty stunning numbers. I've got an easy one and a more strategic one. The easy one is, your guide in AI Hock and Kirsten is calling for almost $1.7 billion of sequential growth. I was curious, maybe you could talk about the diversity of the growth between the three existing customers. Is it pretty well spread out? All of them growing? Or is one sort of driving much of the growth?
And then how strategically one of your competitors bought a photonic fabric company recently I was curious about your take on that technology and if you think it's disruptive or you think it's just gimmickry at this point in time.
Hock Tan:
I like the way you address this question because the way that you address the question to me is almost hesitant. Thank you. I appreciate that. But on your first part, yeah, we are driving growth and we it began to feel like this thing never ends. And it's a real mixed bag. Of existing customers and on existing XPUs And I'll be part of it as XPUs that we're seeing. And that's not to slow down the fact that as I indicated in my remarks and commented on the demand for switches. Not just among six, not among five. Switches. The demand for our latest 1.6 terabit per second DSPs. That enables optical interconnects for scale out. Particularly?
It's just very, very strong. And by extension, demand for the optical components like lasers, pin diodes, just going nuts. All that come together. Now, all that is small dollar, relatively lesser dollars when it comes to XPUs, as you probably guessed. I mean, no. Of this to give you a sense, maybe let me look at it on a backlog side. Of the $73 billion or AI revenue backlog over the next eighteen months, I talked about maybe $20 billion of it is everything else. The rest, is XPUs. Hope that gives you a sense for what the mix is. That's not to say that the rest is still $20 billion. That's not small. By any means.
So we value that. So when you talk about your next question of silicon photonics, and as a means to create basically much better, more efficient, lower power interconnects in not just scale out, but hopefully scale up Yeah. I could see a point in time in the future when silicon photonics methods as the only way to do it. We're not quite there yet. But we have the technology and we continue to develop the technology even as each time we develop it first for 400 gigabit then we going on to nine 800 gigabit bandwidth Not ready for it yet.
So and even we have the product, and we're now doing it for 1.6 terabit bandwidth to create silicon photonics switches silicon photonics interconnects Not even sure it will get fully deployed because you know, engineers, our engineers, our peer, and the peers we have out there, was somehow trying to find a way to still do try to do scale up within a rack in copper as long as possible. And in scale up in no pluggable optics. The final straw is when you can't do it well in pluggable optics. Of course, when you can't do it even in copper, then you're right. You go to silicon photonics. And it will happen. And we're ready for it.
Just saying, not anytime soon.
Harsh Kumar:
Thank you, Hock.
Operator:
One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Carl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
Carl Ackerman:
Yes. Thank you. Could you speak to the supply chain resiliency and visibility you have with your key material suppliers, particularly co-ops as you not only support your existing customer programs, but the two new custom compute processors that you announced since your quarter. I guess what I can get at is you also happen to address the very large subset of networking and compute AI supply chains. You've talked about record backlog. If you were to pin some of the bottlenecks that you have, the areas that you're aiming to address and mitigate from supply chain bottlenecks, what would they be and how do you see that ameliorating into '26? Thank you.
Hock Tan:
It's across the board. Typically. I mean, it's we are very fortunate in some ways that we have the product technology and the operating business lines. To create multiple key leading-edge components that enable today's state-of-the-art AI data centers. I mean, our DSP as I said earlier, is now at 1.6 terabits per second. That's the leading edge. Connectivity for bandwidth for this for the top of the top of the heap, XPU, and even GPU. And we intend to be that way. And we have the lasers EMLs, VCSELs, CWL lasers that go with it. So it's fortunate that we have all this.
And the key comp active components that go with it and we see it very quick early, and we expand the capacity as we do the design to match it. And along this is the long answer to what I'm trying to get at, which is I think we are of any of any of this data center suppliers of the system racks not counting the power the power shell and all that. Now that's hard to get beyond us. On the PowerShell and the transformers and the gas turbines. If you just look at the rack, the systems on AI, we probably have a good handle on where the bottlenecks are because sometimes we are part of the bottlenecks.
Which we then want to get rid to resolve. So we feel pretty good about that. Through 2026.
Carl Ackerman:
Thank you.
Hock Tan:
One moment for our next question.
Operator:
That will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Christopher Rolland:
Hi, thanks for the question. Just first a clarification and then my question. And sorry to come back to this issue, but if I understand you correctly, Hock, I think you were saying that OpenAI would be a general agreement so it's not binding maybe similar to the agreements with both NVIDIA and AMD. And then secondly, you talked about flat non-AI semiconductor revenue Maybe what's going on there? Is there still an inventory overhang in and what could what do we need to get that going again? Do you see growth, eventually, eventually in that business? Thank you.
Hock Tan:
Well, on the non-AI semiconductor, we see broadband literally recovering very well. And we do not see the others No. We see stability. We do not see a sharp recovery that is sustainable yet. So I guess given a one a couple more quarters, but we do not see any further deterioration in demand. And it's more I think maybe the ops and AI is sucking the ops oxygen a lot out of enterprise spending elsewhere. And hyperscaler spending elsewhere. We do not see it getting any worse. We do not see it recovering very quickly. With the exception of broadband. That's a simple summary of non-AI.
With respect to OpenAI now before diving into the I'm just telling you what that 10 gigawatt announcement is all about. Separately, the journey with them on the customer accelerated progresses at a very advanced stage and will happen very, very quickly. And it's and we will have a committed element to this whole thing. And I won't. But what we I was articulating earlier was the 10 gigawatt announcement. And that 10 gigawatt announcement is an agreement to be aligned on developing 10 gigawatts for OpenAI over 27 to 29 time frame. I said, that's different from the XPU program we're developing with them.
Christopher Rolland:
I see. Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. And we do have time for one final question, and that will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore:
Great. Thank you very much. So if you have $21 billion of rack revenue in 2026, I guess, do we stay at that run rate beyond that? Are you gonna continue to sell racks, or does that sort of that type of business make shift over time? And I'm really just trying to figure out the percentage of your eighteen-month backlog that's actually full systems at this point.
Hock Tan:
Well, it's an interesting question. And while that question basically comes to how much compute capacity is needed by our customers over the next as I say, over the period beyond eighteen months. And your guess is probably as good as mine based on what we all know out there. Which is really what it relates to. But if they need more, then you see that continuing even larger. If they do not need it, then probably it won't. But so one is what we're trying to indicate is that the demand we are seeing over that period of time right now.
Operator:

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Adobe had a record first quarter. We achieved $5.71 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 11% year-over-year growth.
GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $4.14, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $5.08, representing 13% year-over-year growth. Our performance reflects the ongoing critical role that Adobe products play in powering the global digital economy. In addition, given Q1 performance, we are pleased to reaffirm our fiscal '25 targets. Next week is Adobe Summit, our flagship Digital Experience Conference, where we will unveil the latest innovations across our portfolio.
In addition, we will host our annual investor meeting on March 18th, and we wanted to preview what we will share about our growth strategy. Adobe's success over the past decade has been driven by the exponential growth of the creative economy and the customer-focused innovations we've delivered across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Our groundbreaking solutions are empowering an ever-expanding universe of users to imagine, create, and deliver standout content that drives exceptional experiences. Adobe's mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences is more critical than ever as digital continues to rapidly transform work life, education, and entertainment.
AI represents a generational opportunity to reimagine our technology platforms to serve an increasingly large and diverse customer universe. With creativity at the core, we have been evolving our offerings and routes to market to anticipate the distinct needs of creative professionals and next-generation creators, marketing professionals, agencies and enterprises, and the broader set of consumers and business professionals. We believe this will drive continued growth and profitability. Creative professionals and creators need power and precision to bring their ideas to life across any media type.
The next generation of creators wants the flexibility of web and mobile tools in addition to the power of the desktop. They will benefit from the variety of AI models to ideate and explore creative possibilities. Adobe will serve this growing community with the most comprehensive set of web, mobile, and desktop applications delivered through various subscription tiers. In addition to Creative Cloud, we will offer new Firefly web app subscriptions that integrate and are an on-ramp for our web and mobile products.
While Adobe's commercially safe Firefly models will be integral to this offering, we will support additional third-party models to be part of this creative process. The Firefly app will be the umbrella destination for new creative categories like ideation. We recently introduced and incorporated our new Firefly video model into this offering, adding to the already supported image, vector, and design models. In addition to monetizing stand-alone subscriptions for Firefly, we will introduce multiple Creative Cloud offerings that include Firefly tiering.
Marketing professionals need to create an unprecedented volume of compelling content and optimize it to deliver personalized digital experiences across channels, including mobile applications, email, social media, and advertising platforms. They're looking for agility and self-service, as well as integrated workflows with their creative teams and agencies. To achieve this, enterprises require custom, commercially safe models and agents tailored to address the inefficiencies of the content supply chain. With Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, Adobe is transforming how brands and their agency partners collaborate on marketing campaigns, unlocking new levels of creativity, personalization, and efficiency.
The combination of the Adobe Experience platform and apps and Adobe GenStudio is the most comprehensive marketing platform to deliver on this vision. In addition to our direct sales force, we will leverage an ecosystem of partners and agencies to sell, implement, operate, and deliver business outcomes to companies of all sizes. We have accelerated One Adobe deals by increasingly integrating our creative and marketing products into a single enterprise solution. We will continue to invest in sales capacity to deliver Adobewide offerings across business, education, and government.
Business professionals and consumers want ease of use across web and mobile through a freemium model. They're looking for quick and easy AI-first category-defining creative applications to help them stand out. While the need for creative expression continues to grow exponentially, the real value is in integrating creativity and productivity in an all-in-one solution. The combination of Express and Acrobat is Adobe's opportunity to make the journey from document creation to consumption smoother than ever.
AI Assistant in Acrobat Reader and Express will accelerate the delivery of new conversational and agentic interfaces to add value to this combined offering. Revenue growth will be driven by distribution across web and mobile app stores, partnerships with major software providers, and focus on SMB and enterprise sales. Our generative AI innovation is infused across the breadth of our products, and its impact is influencing billions of ARR across acquisition, retention, and value expansion as customers benefit from these new capabilities. This strength is also reflected in our AI-first stand-alone and add-on products such as Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly App and Services, and GenStudio for Performance Marketing, which have already contributed greater than $125 million book of business exiting Q1 fiscal '25.
And we expect this AI book of business to double by the end of fiscal '25. In summary, by leveraging the breadth of our products and technology platforms in the era of AI and delivering new tailored offerings and solutions by customer groups, we will drive the engine of growth for the next decade. We will win by focusing on business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals with a unified product strategy and go-to-market. We will start to provide financial visibility in these 2 new groups starting this quarter and expand on this at our Investor Day at Summit next week.
I'll now turn it over to David to discuss the momentum in our digital media business.

President, Digital Media
Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $4.23 billion, which grew 12% year over year. We exited the quarter with $17.63 billion of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 12.6% year over year.
We continue to see healthy performance in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Creative growth was driven by broad-based adoption across our routes to market and product portfolio with particular strength in new offerings like Firefly Services, an increasing number of One Adobe deals and a growing base of web and mobile users. Document Cloud continued to see strong organic demand, continued optimizations in free to paid conversion journeys and AI Assistant being released in additional languages. We drove strong performance across digital media in emerging markets.
The results represent a good start to the fiscal year. Creativity is going mainstream, and I want to provide more color on the audiences we serve. We live in a visual-first world where creative expression has become pervasive in every facet of life. Business professionals and consumers alike aim to produce visually rich, engaging content, whether it's a presentation, birthday invitation or social post.
At the same time, creative professionals, creators, and marketers are competing on the quality of their online presence and the personalized experiences they deliver to customers. They turn to Document Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Experience Cloud to achieve their content goals. Going forward, as a result of AI advancements, we see incredible opportunity to serve customers with audience-specific offerings. Business professionals and consumers are increasingly benefiting from deep integration between Acrobat, Express, and Firefly while creative professionals, creators, and marketers are investing in powerful workflows across Creative Cloud, our new web and mobile creative applications, Firefly and GenStudio.
PDF continues to be the global standard for digital documents for business professionals, and Adobe Acrobat is revolutionizing the way people engage with them across mobile, web, and desktop. Features like AI Assistant in Acrobat and Reader have been a game-hanger for everyone from sales teams to students looking for faster insights and smarter document editing. And the ability to share links and click comments has increased document productivity and helped drive additional adoption. These new capabilities and our cross-service investments have paid off with Acrobat and Reader monthly active usage growing 23% year over year.
Our success with Acrobat has also shown us that whether for a sales presentation, a school project or a social media post, business professionals and consumers are looking for an easy-to-use solution that helps them create visually compelling content that stands out from the crowd of generic templates. In fact, a significant number of all documents created in Acrobat are visual documents, things like marketing content, sales pitches, presentations, infographics, and cover pages. We are making good progress in addressing this need by embedding Express capabilities as a native experience in Acrobat with the goal of boosting productivity and making the journey from document consumption to content creation smoother than ever. The integration of Adobe Express features in Acrobat allows users to create richer PDFs with AI-generated cover pages, embedded infographics, and customized images and empowers users to create fully formed animated videos and other rich digital output.
We see numerous early indicators of user demand as express usage through Acrobat has grown 10x year over year. Other highlights for business professionals and consumers include Acrobat AI Assistant support for languages now includes English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese. Acrobat AI Assistant support for legal workflows with contract-specific features. New AI capabilities in Express like clip maker for auto generation of video highlights and text rewrite to help produce more effective copy.
Expanded Acrobat integrations with Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Gmail, and Google Drive and strong adoption of link sharing for richer collaborative experiences have led to approximately 50% year-over-year growth in Acrobat web monthly active usage. Expanded Express integrations now include Miro, Box, Slack, Webflow, and HubSpot. The Express ecosystem also expanded to 225 plug-ins, more than doubling in the last year. Strong business and student adoption, Express onboarded nearly 6,000 new businesses in Q1, representing approximately 50% quarter-over-quarter growth.
Students with access to express premium grew 85% year over year. Key global customer wins include AT&T, Delta Airlines, Disney, Ernst and Young, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Paramount, and Qatar Airlines. Creative professionals and the next generation of creators who make their living by designing and producing content are focused on standing out and bringing their unique creative visions to life with pixel-perfect precision. As we mark the 35th anniversary of Photoshop, Adobe Creative applications remain the solutions of choice for the world's creative professionals across imaging, design, photography, video, illustration, and 3D.
We also see increasing demand from the next generation of creators who are looking for freemium web and mobile applications as they begin their creative journeys. To better serve these users, we launched a new Photoshop mobile app and an expanded web experience, delivering Photoshop's iconic image editing and design capabilities on the iPhone. The mobile app and all new web experience are also included in current Photoshop plans, offering established Photoshop customers a flexible ecosystem to create and edit across surfaces. The launch garnered over 30 million social engagements in just two weeks.
The release of the Adobe FireFly video model in February, a commercially safe generative AI video model, has been very positively received by brands and creative professionals who have already started using it to create production-ready content. Users can generate video clips from a text prompt or image, use camera angles to control shots, create distinct scenes with 3D sketches, craft atmospheric elements, and develop custom motion design elements. We're thrilled to see creative professionals and enterprises and agencies, including Dentsu, PepsiCo, and Stagwell finding success with the video model. Additionally, we recently launched an all-new Firefly application, the most comprehensive destination to generate images, vectors, and now videos with unmatched creative control and direct integration with our industry-leading creative apps to seamlessly move from ideation to production.
In addition to generating images, videos, and designs from text, the app lets you generate videos from keyframes, use 3D designs to precisely direct generations, and translate audio and video into multiple languages. We also launched two new plans as part of this release, Firefly Standard and Firefly Pro and began the rollout of our third plan, Firefly Premium yesterday. User engagement has been strong with over 90% of paid users generating videos. The launch of Photoshop on web and mobile and the release of the new Firefly application expands our growing family of web and mobile products, which now includes Photoshop for creative imaging, Lightroom for photography, Express for Design, and Firefly for ideation and early production.
These apps serve as value-added capabilities to our existing paid subscribers and as a frictionless freemium onboarding experience to attract and monetize next-generation creators. We're delighted with the early interest in these new offerings. Other creative professional and creator highlights include, continued strong adoption of GenAI in our products with Photoshop GenAI monthly active users at approximately 35% and Lightroom GenAI monthly active users at 30%. Users have generated over 20 billion assets with Firefly.
The introduction of new features in Premier Pro beta and After Effects beta are helping editors and motion designers stay ahead of deadlines with AI features like Media Intelligence, which helps users find footage faster using natural language and caption translation for 17 languages, which effortlessly expand video to global audiences. We're honored to see visionary filmmakers around the world telling the season's most acclaimed stories using Adobe Creative applications, including Academy Award winners, Anora and Dune: Part Two. The launch of Adaptive profiles and distraction removal in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Camera raw, which reduced tedious and repetitive tasks. Max Japan brought our community together and served as an opportunity for us to launch a number of new innovations, including performance improvements in Adobe Illustrator, which accelerate features like pan and zoom and loading large files up to 10x faster.
We had another great quarter in the enterprise with more customers turning to Firefly Services and custom models to scale on-brand content production for marketing use cases, including leading brands such as Deloitte Digital, IBM, IPG Health, Mattel, and Tapestry. Tapestry, for example, has implemented a new and highly productive digital twin workflow using custom models in Firefly. You'll hear more on how the combination of creativity and marketing is powering personalization at scale and enterprises. Adobe is incredibly well set up to take advantage of AI across creativity.
We're rapidly delivering tailored innovations to serve the full continuum of content creation for business professionals and consumers, creative professionals and creators, and marketing professionals. Our expanding breadth of offerings is reaching a broader universe of customers, and our incredible go-to-market strength and proven data-driven operating model are propelling the growth of both flagship and new offerings. We will be unveiling more exciting product capabilities at Adobe Summit and MAXLondon in April. I'll now pass it to Anil.

Now we're bringing together creativity and marketing with AI to help our customers realize the full potential of personalization at scale.
Up to now, marketing professionals have been constrained by the number of content variations they can create and the number of journeys they can deploy. With Adobe GenStudio, brands around the globe have been working with Adobe to bring creative and marketing teams closer together, simplify their creation to activation process, and unlock new levels of creativity, insights, and efficiency in marketing campaigns. Other highlights include, strong demand for Adobe Experience Platform and native applications with Q1 subscription revenue growing nearly 50% year on year; of real-time CDP collaboration, delivering a secure environment for advertisers and publishers to jointly discover, activate, and measure high-value audiences for more relevant campaigns. Built on AEP, real-time CDP collaboration is purpose-built for brands to connect and collaborate on first-party data.

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Anil. Adobe's business has grown over the last decade by delivering world-class products grouped within three clouds: Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. In parallel, we've continued to expand across cloud offerings to better serve different customer groups. Examples include Acrobat, which is reflected in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud; GenStudio, which includes Creative Cloud, Express, Firefly Services, and Experience Cloud.
Enterprises who want to engage with One Adobe in combined creative seats with marketing automation. And increasingly, Acrobat, and Express. We believe Adobe's success will be driven by innovation in service of both business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals. Reporting insights and the financial performance across these customer groups will provide a clear view of Adobe's execution against our strategy.
We will, therefore, provide overall Adobe revenue, digital media and digital experience segment revenue; digital experience subscription revenue and digital media ending ARR in aggregate rather than by cloud, as well as subscription revenue for business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals. Subscription revenue provided will primarily include revenue from SaaS, managed services, and term offerings. Business professionals and consumers group will consist of all subscription revenue from Document Cloud, Acrobat subscription revenue in Creative Cloud and Adobe Express subscription revenue in Creative Cloud, all of which are a part of digital media. Creative and marketing professionals group will consist of all subscription revenue from digital experience, as well as all of the remaining subscription revenue from Creative Cloud in digital media.
In today's call, I'll cover three main areas: our Q1 FY '25 results focusing on key growth drivers, financial targets, and our supplemental disclosures. Now turning to the quarter. In the first quarter of FY '25, Adobe achieved revenue of $5.71 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth or 11% in constant currency. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $4.14 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $5.08.
Q1 business and financial highlights included, digital media revenue of $4.23 billion, digital media ending ARR of $17.63 billion, growing 12.6% year over year. Digital experience revenue of $1.41 billion, cash flows from operations of $2.48 billion. And exiting the quarter, remaining performance obligations were $19.69 billion, growing 12% year over year, and CRPO growing 11%. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $4.23 billion, which represents 11% year-over-year growth or 12% in constant currency.
We exited the quarter with $17.63 billion of digital media ARR, growing our ending ARR book of business 12.6% year over year in constant currency. First quarter digital media growth drivers included: strong growth for Acrobat across all routes to market and geographies; Acrobat web and mobile growth driven by freemium funnel and app store optimizations; growth in Adobe Express, fueled by top-of-funnel improvements, PLG journeys across Acrobat and Express and B2B customer onboarding. Strength in user adoption and engagement of Acrobat AI Assistant driven by expansion of features, including support for additional languages and contract intelligence capabilities. Growth of creative flagship offerings driven by all apps, stock, imaging and photography.
Continued momentum in creative web and mobile offerings with 35% year over year ending paid subscription growth, and strong momentum in the enterprise, driven by Firefly Services and the continued benefit from the upsell motion of generative AI-enabled offerings. Turning to our digital experience segment. In Q1, we achieved revenue of $1.41 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported and in constant currency. Digital experience subscription revenue was $1.30 billion, growing 11% year over year as reported and in constant currency.
First quarter digital experience growth drivers included: momentum for product offerings across content, data and journeys; AEP and app subscription revenue growing nearly 50% year on year. GenStudio Solutions surpassing $1 billion in ending ARR book of business, early momentum in GenStudio for Performance Marketing and adoption and pipeline and improvements in overall enterprise retention. Turning now to our customer group performance. Creative and marketing professionals group subscription revenue was $3.92 billion, which represents 10% year-over-year growth as reported.
Business professionals and consumers group subscription revenue was $1.53 billion, which represents 15% year-over-year growth as reported. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 17% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. RPO exiting the quarter was $19.69 billion, growing 12% year over year or 13% in constant currency, and CRPO growing 11% year over year or 12% in constant currency. Our cash flows from operations in the quarter were a Q1 record $2.48 billion, and ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $7.44 billion.
In Q1, we entered into share repurchase agreements totaling $3.25 billion, and we currently have $14.4 billion remaining of our $25 billion authorization granted in March 2024. Let me now turn to our Q2 FY '25 financial targets. For Q2 FY '25, we're targeting: total Adobe revenue of $5.77 billion to $5.82 billion; digital media segment revenue of $4.27 billion to $4.30 billion; digital experience segment revenue of $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion; digital experience subscription revenue of $1.315 billion to $1.325 billion; GAAP earnings per share of $3.80 to $3.85; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.95 to $5. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5%.
The year is off to a good start and assuming current macroeconomic conditions, I'm pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance for fiscal year 2025. This quarter's strong performance reflects Adobe's long-standing focus on innovation and meeting the growing needs of our broad customer base. As businesses increasingly prioritize digital transformation, we're uniquely positioned to deliver value through our highly differentiated solutions and proven go-to-market execution to unleash the power of creativity. Looking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities to drive growth for our customers as we continue to shape the future in the era of AI.
We look forward to seeing you next week at our investor meeting at Summit 2025. Thank you, and we'll now take questions. Operator?

Good afternoon. Shantanu, if you took the AI book of business, it would be low single-digit percent of your total revenue for the year. I guess many are asking, when does this become more material? How long does it take? What is required? Maybe just help us walk through the AI journey and how that translates to revenue.
Shantanu Narayen
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Happy to, Brent. If you take a step back and think about it, we've always talked about the AI journey as three parts. The first is ensuring that we innovate. The second is all about tracking usage and ensuring value and monetization.
And I would say we're really pleased across all three of those journeys as we've had conversations with you folks as well in the past. A significant amount of the AI monetization is also happening in terms of attracting people to our subscription, making sure they are retained and having them drive higher-value price SKUs. So, when somebody buys Creative Cloud or when somebody buys Document Cloud, in effect, they are actually monetizing AI. But in addition to that, Brent, what we wanted to do was give you a flavor for the new stand-alone products that we have when we've talked about introducing Acrobat AI Assistant and rolling that out in different languages, Firefly, and making sure that we have a new subscription model associated with that on the web, Firefly Services for the enterprise and GenStudio.
So, the $125 million book of business that we talked about exiting Q1 only relates to that new book of business. And that's, again, stuff that we said we would double. But I think in terms of the impact also on the overall business, that has had a material part. But if you play this out a little bit more and you talk about what investors can expect, I think with the new Firefly app that's come out, this is a web product with a new subscription, ability to have the video model, ability to have ideation as part of it.
Think of it as then integrating Photoshop web, Express web, and all of the other products, all of that is also upside. And you'll see a lot more innovation in that area and you'll see a lot more monetization in that area. And again, the last thing I'll probably say, Brent, is that the whole idea was to start to tee it up, and then again at the FA meeting, to continue to expand on how that is. But net-net, I would say, whether it's innovation, having our own models, integrating it across all of our products, brand new revenue streams like GenStudio in the enterprise and then usage and monetization, I feel really good about it.

And the next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.
Brent Bracelin

Analyst
Hi, thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. I wanted to double-click into the demand linearity you saw in the quarter. I appreciate the commentary reaffirming 11% digital media ARR growth guide for the full year.
But could you provide more color on trends you saw in the quarter across Creative and Document Cloud here? Thanks.
David Wadhwani
--
President, Digital Media
Yeah, happy to do that. So, again, just digital media ARR was a 12.6% growth, which is in line with our expectation and also the mix was in line with our expectations. If you take a step back and you look at the demand and sort of the way the business played out this quarter, it's consistent with what we've seen historically, and we've seen sort of a broad-based demand for the products with a few highlights that I think are worth calling out. First of all, as it comes to business professionals and consumers, this is obviously a huge market with billions of users that we're going after.
And our strategy here is to really make sure that productivity that we deliver a solution for productivity from consumption all the way to creation and that's really what we're doing with Acrobat and Express. We saw a lot of momentum in these businesses. We talked about how Acrobat is up 23% year over year in terms of monthly active users. We're seeing stronger conversion on those users, and that's been helping drive the business.
AI Assistant, obviously, we introduced that last year, continues to do very well and it's certainly helping with that strategy of faster consumption and conversational experiences. We saw 2x quarter-over-quarter usage growth in AI Assistant. And of course, in that context, Express has been a great product. The product right now is just -- it's an amazing product to use.
And so, that also, we've been investing in very significantly. From a marketing standpoint but also from a partnership standpoint, we've doubled the partner ecosystem in the last year. It now includes new names like Miro and Box and Webflow and HubSpot. We have 85% more access -- 85% year-over-year growth in students with access to it.
We've been ramping up our student and campus ambassador programs. We added 6,000 new small, medium businesses to the Express product as well. And even within Acrobat, where we've been doing more -- we're seeing much more demand. We saw a 10x year-over-year engagement of Express capabilities from Acrobat users.
So, feeling really good about that audience group. On the Creative pro and creator side, Shantanu mentioned this already, but the introduction of the Firefly video model being used by PNC and Pepsi and Dentsu and PepsiCo and Stagwell, Firefly new offerings from Standard to Pro. And just yesterday, we introduced Premium, which is a much larger set of generative credits and all of those represent new monetization models. We introduced Photoshop mobile and web.
We saw hundreds of articles, 30 million social engagements. We were just listed as the focused app on the App Store over the weekend. We saw some great new advances for AI coming into Lightroom web and mobile. Premier also saw some great advances in terms of AI.
So, lots of momentum in that business. And what's really exciting is that as we've done all of this innovation, as Shantanu was talking about, we also have three big milestones coming up with Summit next week then NAB shortly after that, then MAXLondon shortly after that. And this is starting to show up. Obviously, we've talked about generation as we crossed 20 billion generations.
We're doing more than 1 billion generations now a month and 90% of people using Firefly the app also saw -- are generating video, as well as part of that. But we also saw a strong growth in the enterprise. I don't know, Anil, if you want to add something.
Anil S. Chakravarthy
--
President, Digital Experience
Yeah, exactly. To just echo what you were saying, I think in the enterprise, we see a lot of demand for creativity and marketing and AI coming together. Every CMO that we talk to, every agency that we work with, they're all very interested in how generative AI can be used to transform how the content supply chain works. And with the GenStudio offering, which combines the creativity and the marketing and the AI, we've seen tremendous traction and we saw a number of both customer wins, as well as a number of agency partners, and we look forward to unveiling a lot more of this at Summit.
David Wadhwani

And the next question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss
--
Analyst
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question And thank you for the additional disclosure. I think it's a really interesting view kind of breaking down the creative and marketing professionals versus the business professionals and consumer group. And kind of following on that last question, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels kind of bullish to me that the business professionals and consumer group has a stronger growth rate, creative at 15% creative, and marketing professionals a little bit behind because it feels like business professionals and consumer group, those products would be faster sales cycle, particularly on the consumer side of the equation, faster adoption.
The creative and marketing professionals, this broader solution that you're trying to sell would have a longer sales cycle. So, the question is, am I thinking about that right? And are you seeing any indications that, that creative and marketing professional group, whether it's in your pipeline or sort of the activity you're seeing, could that catch up with what we're seeing from the business professionals and consumer group?
Shantanu Narayen
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, Keith, I mean, part of our goal was really to start to provide insight into by the customer groups, how we're starting to see it. And to some degree, when people are wondering how we are actually driving creative, and the reality is that when you think about the GenStudio set of products, which we now said is a $1 billion book of business, AEP and Apps is also a $1 billion book of business and the creative professional, that's actually addressing the entire content supply chain. And so, in terms of that growth rate, as we add new subscriptions like the Firefly app subscription, add more video, add more functionality in what we are doing with GenStudio, that growth rate as well, it's a very large untapped opportunity and people have been asking us questions about the strength of the creative market, as well as the strength of that market within the enterprise. And we think that's a large TAM, we'll share more.
So, I think you're thinking of it right, which is to say the $5 billion book of business that we built for digital marketing, that's really helping the content and the creative economy. And so, that was the idea behind giving you a window into that. And the metrics associated with that are subscription and different kinds of offerings. On the other side of the equation as well, to your point, what we wanted to do is reflect the fact that the investments that we made in both Acrobat and Express continuing to ensure distribution when we think about the monthly average users.
If you take it in aggregate, I mean, Adobe has hundreds of millions of people who are using monthly -- are using our products. And that will be really the early metrics and the indicators of how Express and Acrobat continue to grow. So, I'm glad that you found the additional disclosure beneficial. And that was the idea.
And to Brent's earlier question as well, I just wanted to clarify. I mean, we are not taking all of the revenue that we see in digital media and digital experience and calling that AI revenue. But relative to what I've seen from any other company in our particular space, we've actually been pleased by how much of it, whether it's additional tiers of AI in the digital experience, so what we are seeing across Acrobat, as well as the creative professional space, there's been good adoption of AI in that. And so, that was the other intent, to start to show that so that we can talk about it more at the FA meeting.
Keith Weiss

Analyst
Outstanding. Can I sneak one last one in for Mr. Durn? It's great to see you guys take advantage of the pullback in the stock price by accelerating the share repurchase which picked up this quarter. Could this pace of share repurchases, can you guys sustain this throughout the year, or is that more of a one-time pickup?
Daniel J. Durn
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, if I take a step back, Keith, and you think about the last four quarters, we've repurchased almost $11 billion. And we've always talked about if there's opportunities to be opportunistic along the way, we would take advantage of it. And I think that's what you saw play out in Q1.
We've got a strong point of view about the financial profile throughout the course of the year. Happy to reaffirm guidance, but we're going to drive that with strong operating margins, strong cash flow delivery, and be strong capital allocators throughout the year. So, we feel good about where we sit. And if there's opportunities to be opportunistic, we will.

And the next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.
Kash Rangan
--
Analyst
Hi. Thank you very much. Much appreciate the disclosure and the color and everything that goes with it. Shantanu, question for you.
When you pivoted the company to a new business model through cloud, initially, there was a lot of skepticism. Then you proved to us that the TAM was actually larger in the new creative meets the cloud cycle. And the company was able to accelerate through the transition and put up even better margins and by expanding the TAM necessarily. So, as you look at AI right now, right now, one bearish argument that one could make, which I don't subscribe to, is that you're playing defense and that AI is a cost of staying in business and keeping yourself relevant to your creative base.
But how do you look, since you've been through this one big shift before, you've got a lot of experience, where is your conviction on how truly incremental AI can be for your growth? Could you be at a similar juncture where you're poised to get into the next cycle is actually bigger TAM, not to put words in your mouth, but even maybe dare I say the potential to accelerate off of the good growth that we've seen so far? Thank you so much.
Shantanu Narayen

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, Kash, what I appreciate about the question is, this is what we wanted to really tee up in front of the FA meeting. But without a doubt, as David described, the opportunity for the business professional and consumers, I think you'll start to see and we'll share more at the FA meeting that there are billions of people that we can bring into the fold for creativity and productivity and talk more about how we're, with the distribution that we have and with the monthly average users that we have, monetize that much like we've monetized Acrobat. And we definitely believe that it's a massive, massive opportunity. I think it's the same thing across creators.
There are more creators that are entering. And again, I'll preview a little bit of what David will share, which is when you think about the web and mobile offerings that we're providing to attract more people to our platform as creative professionals and next-generation creators, the number of people who want to enter that profession is significantly larger than it's ever been. And so, with products like Photoshop on web and mobile, as well as Firefly app, that's clearly the intent to show how that as a subscription service and attracting the next generation creators will be a tailwind. And then when you put this together in the enterprise, I mean, hopefully, what you also see as part of the additional disclosures is that the enterprise has continued to be a material part of our business and material part of our growth because they are, in order to do personalization at scale, as Anil is talking about, there's going to be more content that's produced.
There's going to be more content that's actually inserted into ad systems and social media. And so, again, I think setting the stage for how that's a larger opportunity. But if you look at it from not just the length of we were marketing but look at the lens of, hey, that's a content business for us in the enterprise. We will again outline how that is only going to be a growing opportunity.
So, no question in my mind, all three of these are actually going to accelerate in terms of the TAM and then we have to innovate and execute against that. So, I am more excited about the larger opportunity without a doubt as a result of AI. And we've talked about this, Kash. If you don't take advantage of AI, it's a disruption.
In our particular case, the intent is clearly to show how it's a tailwind.

Excellent. And one follow-up and very quick, promise if I can. With the turbulence in the markets with trade wars, etc., tariffs, etc., how do you feel your customer base is going to behave? Is everything going to be on track from what you can tell by talking to your customers? Or are they kind of perplexed by what's going on and pausing? Thank you so much and that's it for me.
Shantanu Narayen

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean, I think we just sort of said, assuming current macroeconomic conditions, I mean, we have a diverse business. We're off to a good start in the conversations that we are having. And all of us have conversations with all of our other peers. And I think we have a seasoned management team that will navigate it.
But customers, I think we're all jointly trying to understand what happens in the economy. But the tariffs, etc., don't really impact Adobe the way they impact other businesses. And so, we are optimistic.

And the next question will come from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.
Mark Moerdler

Analyst
Thank you very much. Dan, can you give us more color on why you're changing the categorization of revenue, removing the historical Document Cloud and Creative Cloud? Is this driven by the One Adobe sales motion? Is Express now sold predominantly with Document Cloud? How should we think about the drivers? Thank you.
Daniel J. Durn
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so thanks for the question, Mark. As we laid it out, we talked about increasingly driving cross-cloud offerings. We're already doing it today. We're going to be doing more of it going forward.
And as you look at individuals increasingly buying offerings, as you look at enterprises increasingly buying solutions and bringing different parts of our portfolio together to meet their highest value needs around these two groupings of the customers, it really is meant to just draw a highlight to our strategy and how we're executing against that strategy. On a go-forward basis, our success is going to be driven by the way we innovate into the intersection of productivity and creativity, into the intersection of creativity and marketing. And those intersections are highlighted by these two groupings of customers. And so, the intent around this is to really bring to life how we're driving our strategy, how we're executing against it provides the best insight in how the company is performing on a go-forward basis.
Shantanu Narayen

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And Mark, at least two specific things that we've heard as feedback from all of you folks are, you understand that there's an Acrobat within the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. This pulls out the business in order to show the momentum and the opportunity in that business. And to your question about One Adobe, yes, I mean, the GenStudio solution is, without a doubt, taking seats of products like Photoshop or the Creative Cloud, is adding Express in it for every marketer in there. We have Firefly Services and custom models.
And so, the more we sell that as one enterprise offering and we want to accelerate the sale of that as a strategic partnership, that's now also all reflected in one of those revenue slices. So, we believe that the additional disclosure will also give you more visibility into routes to market.
Mark Moerdler

That makes a lot of sense. And one quick other one. Should we expect the disclosure on the AI ARR something that we'll be getting quarterly or periodically updated? Thank you.

And the next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.
Alex Zukin
--
Analyst
Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. And I will join the chorus of those commenting positively on some of the new numbers, particularly the AI book of business. And that's where I wanted to ask the question. Basically, look, you're going to give us a number, we're going to ask for more.
So, in that spirit, if you look at the $125 million and you think about the segmentation between Assistant, Firefly, GenStudio, is there any triangulation around maybe how much -- what the percentages of for the breakout of those and maybe stack rank the growth rates that are going to get you to double that by the end of the year? And then kind of similarly, if you think about if that $125 million is impacting or where the tailwinds are more toward the creative and marketing professional or the business professionals?
David Wadhwani
--
President, Digital Media
Yeah. Great question, Alex. So, first of all, if you look at the mix of these things, AI Assistant has been around for about three quarters or four quarters now. Firefly Service has been around for about four quarters as well.
GenStudio was introduced late in Q4 of last year. So, that gives you a little bit of a sense that the composition is going to sort of like be based on the tenure of these products in the market. But if we take a step back and you look at the growth trajectory, again, we're talking $195 million -- sorry, $125 million doubling in the next nine months. It gives you a sense of the scale of these businesses and really the momentum that's in the business.
And when you look at it, the core innovation that Shantanu talked about led to a lot of utilization. And now we're starting to get to a point where we can monetize it. For Firefly, we have imaging, vector, design, video, voice, video, and voice coming out just a couple of weeks ago, off to a good start. I know there have been some questions about how important is commercially safety of the models.
They're very important. A lot of enterprises are turning to them for the quality, the breadth but also the commercial safety, the creative control that we give them around being able to really match structure, style, set keyframes for precise video generation, 3D to image, image to video. The inclusion also, on a road map, and we'll share more about this next week of third-party models really establishes us as the one-stop shop for anything you need to do with creativity. And then when you ladder that into a Firefly stand-alone offer with multiple tiers with Standard, Premium, and Pro, when you look at that integrated into Creative Cloud, you could imagine further tiering there.
When you look at the work that we're doing in conjunction with Anil's team around GenStudio and making sure all of these models and this entire platform, including third-party models are exposed within our GenStudio offer, what it's really doing is it's evolving away from the conversation being about the model to the conversation being about the workflows and the integration and the application tier and the agent-based things that we'll be talking to you more about. And that really plays to our differentiation, our strength, and our audiences that we serve. And that's why you see the bullishness of that $125 million doubling in the next nine months.
Shantanu Narayen
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'm glad that you find the sort of information useful. I'll give you a little bit more color as well on that. Remember, with Acrobat, we have AI Assistant that's separate, so this is only the separate Acrobat AI Assistant.
So, the majority of that revenue is actually Creative because as we can continue to put the AI Assistant as part of an Acrobat SKU. We would not count that if that came as part of an Acrobat Premium SKU. So, color-wise so far, creative actually represents the majority of that. But as you know, the Acrobat business is doing great.
Alex Zukin
--
Analyst
That's very, very helpful. I guess maybe just to follow along there. You've seen -- or we've seen a lot of consolidation start to happen within the AI realm where the model companies or the agent even emerging the agentic companies. Maybe just remind us on how you're thinking about your approach toward organic versus inorganic innovation here, given just the plethora of functionality that you're releasing across the board.
Shantanu Narayen
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
As it relates to the core creative models, we will have our commercially safe, as David said, Alex, and so within Firefly as an application and within each of our product integrations and Photoshop, etc., expect Firefly. We've also signaled and we've shown how we would support third-party models associated with that. And so, whether it's a custom model that we create for one of our enterprise customers, I think if you look at it, there have been a couple of articles this week about how whether it's Estee Lauder, who is going to be building their models built on ours and leveraging it or a company like Publicis that's going to be taking these models. So, our core imaging video franchise, we'll have our models as it relates to text, we have support for other third-party models.
And so, I think it's a very practical and it's the right one, and we'll support all of the creative third-party models that people want to support, whether it's a custom model we create for them or whether it's any other third-party model within Firefly as an app and within Photoshop, you're going to see support for that as well. And so, think of it as we are the way in which those models actually deliver value to a user. And so, it's actually just like we did with Photoshop plug-ins in the past, you're going to see those models supported within our flagship applications. Hopefully, that gives you a sense.

And the next question will come from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan.
Mark Murphy

Analyst
Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can just comment on what you're sensing fundamentally in terms of advertising activity and consumer spending trends in the wake of some very choppy results from multiple airlines the last several days and multiple retailers. What is giving you the resilience to reaffirm the FY '25 guidance when some of those are really huge sectors of the economy and they seem to be encountering some turbulence? I'm just wondering if there -- you basically see them continuing to create and market and advertise despite this environment.
Shantanu Narayen
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I think at the end of the day, Mark, we just believe that digital is going to continue to be a fundamental part of the economy and the importance is going to continue. I mean, there isn't a single company that I've talked to that doesn't say digital. To your point, as other companies view macroeconomic conditions that may be particular to them, onuses on every company that's serving them with technology to demonstrate how the technology helps, whether it's the top line or the efficiency. But whether it's top-line growth or efficiency or both, they're not going to go out of style as it relates to any enterprise saying, how can I use technology to accomplish my objectives?
Mark Murphy
--
Analyst
OK. I appreciate that, Shantanu. As a very quick follow-up on Alex's question, with the ARR, the $125 million ARR doubling in the next nine months, do you think it's going to be the same composition, or is something going to be coming in from the video models that might change the mix there in the next nine months?
Shantanu Narayen
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The video model is part of the creative Firefly app that will be part of this. I think a lot of these great questions, Mark, I mean, at the FA meeting, we'll try and give more color, as well as to what we are seeing. But we wanted to at least start to outline what products were in there, the growth rates that we expect, and how we're executing on, as I said, the innovation, usage, understanding, and offering these as monetization. So, we'll also, I know, keep a track of the ongoing questions and address them at the FA meeting as well, Mark.
Mark Murphy

OK, great.

And our last question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.
Saket Kalia
--
Analyst
Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here and squeezing me in. I'll keep it to one. David, maybe for you. It's great to see the Firefly app tiers that customers can add to their existing subscriptions.
And maybe to Shantanu's point, this is a better topic for FA Day, but I'm wondering if we could just talk about, how do you envision sort of the potential attach rate there? I mean, Firefly is clearly an unprecedented offering so maybe that's really tough to answer. But are there any products that maybe Adobe has seen in the past like Adobe Stock or any others that you look at as sort of a framework for what that adoption curve could look like?
David Wadhwani
--
President, Digital Media
Yeah. I think, so if we take a look -- if you take a step back, the reason we're so excited about the Firefly app is really twofold. One is exactly where you're going, Saket, and what you're asking about, which is the -- with every conversation we've had with creative professionals, we know that wherever they are, they're under an enormous amount of pressure to produce more. And this cohort of creative professionals, we see very strong attach and adoption of the generative AI features we put in the product partially because they're well integrated and very discoverable and because they just work and people get a lot of value out of that.
So, what you will see is you'll start to see us integrating these new capabilities, these premium capabilities that are in the Firefly Standard, Pro, and Premium plans more deeply into the creative workflow so more people have the opportunity to discover them. And of course, as part of that, I think you can expect to see what we've done all along is look at where the usage is, look at where the excitement is, and make sure we get the pricing and the tiering right in a way that maximizes the opportunity for our customers and maximizes the opportunity and the value that Adobe and our shareholders get as part of that, too. So, that will be a big area and a big opportunity, and we see a lot of potential there as we look ahead. The other part that I want to make sure doesn't get lost in this is how relevant this Firefly experience is for noncreative professionals as well, this next generation of creators that we keep talking about.
And if we look at the early adoption rates of the Firefly paid plan, it really tells us both of these stories. We have a high degree of conviction that it's adding value and being used by creative professionals, but it's also proving to be a good onboarding opportunity for next-generation pros and creators in general. And that's where Shantanu mentioned earlier, there is an increasing opportunity to merge our web and mobile offerings around not just the generative capabilities but what you do with the content you generate with Photoshop web and mobile, Express web and mobile. And you can imagine other capabilities coming around video as well.
So, we're excited about Firefly Services and the monetization capabilities there in both directions, new users and also value and ARPU for our existing base.
Shantanu Narayen

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And Saket, since that was the last question, thank you. And maybe just in a quick summary, I mean, the four things that I would leave you all with is Q1 was a strong start. We were pleased with our performance. When you think about the addressable markets that we have, as we think about how we serve the business professional and the consumer and the creative professional and the marketing professional, we believe that, that's an immense opportunity that's only going to grow as a result of AI.
We're pleased with how AI is now infused across all of our products and how we are further tailoring the breadth of our products to serve these customer groups in a way in which we delight them. And we're starting to outline how the monetization will be different for each one of these and applicable for the customer group that we are serving. We really continue to believe that this will drive growth and profitability for us as a company in '25 and beyond. And so, we look forward to joining you all at the FA meeting, and thank you for joining us today.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Shantanu Narayen:
Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Adobe delivered another strong quarter achieving record revenue of $5.87 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $3.94 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $5.06, representing 13% year-over-year growth. At our Investor Meeting in March, we outlined our growth strategy for the company centered on delivering transformative innovation for diverse customer audiences, business professionals, consumers, creators, creative professionals, and marketing professionals. The creative opportunity is expanding across audiences with AI as an accelerant. It is opening the content floodgates, tapping into everyone's imagination, and massively expanding the number of creative assets being created, edited, integrated, and delivered.
There are billions of business professionals and consumers in the world who want to be both creative and efficient to accomplish their objectives. They see AI and conversational interfaces as a more productive way to accelerate creative storytelling and to quickly synthesize information across multiple documents. They're looking for quick and easy tools that are available on every computing surface and an easy on-ramp that allows them to trial products and subscribe based on the value derived. As the need for creative expression continues to grow exponentially, creativity and productivity are merging. AI can make them more creative and productive in their business context.
Adobe pioneered creative storytelling through groundbreaking applications like Photoshop and Illustrator and digital document sharing with the introduction of PDF and Acrobat. Our strategy is to bring productivity and creativity to life for billions of users across a variety of surfaces. Acrobat AI Assistant is redefining how people extract value from digital documents, unlocking new levels of productivity by cutting time to insights through conversational interfaces. Adobe Express is using AI to enable consumers to quickly design and publish engaging content through conversational AI in an easy-to-use, all-in-one application. Our unique value proposition is integrating these solutions to facilitate a smoother creation-to-consumption process through mobile apps, web browsers, and desktop offerings.
Adobe's monthly active users across these categories now exceed over 700 million users. In the Creative and Marketing Professionals group, creative professionals need best-of-breed applications that enable them to bring their ideas to life across media types, including imaging, design, video, photography, illustration, animation, 3D, and more. These offerings need to extend across all surfaces and facilitate seamless collaboration with multiple stakeholders. The next generation of creators is looking for powerful on-ramps through web and mobile platforms. Ideation through AI is an emerging category that will be made more powerful through support for multiple creative models.
Adobe is delivering a comprehensive creative platform that extends from ideation through creation to mass production and delivery to address this content supply chain opportunity. At the heart of this creative AI revolution is Adobe Firefly, an on-ramp to creative expression that augments the power of Creative Cloud desktop applications. The Firefly app is a new destination for AI-assisted content ideation, creation, and production with Adobe's comprehensive family of commercially safe Firefly creative models and an expansive ecosystem of third-party models. Firefly empowers creative professionals to generate images, video, audio, and vectors from a single place, with unmatched creative control, iterate on their creations through Adobe's creative apps, and seamlessly deliver them into production.
Our support for third-party models, including from Google, OpenAI, and Black Forest Labs, gives creators the flexibility to choose the AI that works best for them, with Firefly upholding our standards for IP safety and transparency. We rolled out new Firefly offerings globally, and we'll be delivering more innovation over the next few months. Paired with Creative Cloud apps, the Firefly app empowers creative professionals with enhanced precision and performance, ready to support them whenever and wherever inspiration strikes. The Firefly app is attracting new users to the Adobe franchise, with time subscribers growing 30% quarter over quarter.
Our Digital Experience business was inspired by our vision to enable this creative output to be delivered at scale by enterprises as part of their digital market transformation. We have a unique advantage and opportunity to integrate creativity, marketing, and AI to deliver customer experience orchestration. Marketing professionals need to create an unprecedented volume of compelling content and optimize it to deliver personalized digital experiences across channels, including mobile apps, email, websites, social media, and advertising platforms. They're looking for agility and self-service, as well as integrated workflows with their creative teams and agencies. To achieve this, enterprises require custom, commercially safe models and purpose-built agents tailored to address the inefficiencies of the content supply chain.
Marketing practitioners, chief marketing officers, and Chief Digital Officers need solutions that enable them to acquire, engage, and delight customers across a variety of channels and geographies. Adobe's strategy is to deliver a comprehensive marketing technology platform leveraging AI to offer vertical solutions that integrate content, customer data, and profiles across journeys in both B2B and B2C industries. Adobe Gen Studio and Firefly Services are revolutionizing the content supply chain across enterprises, empowering marketers to activate personalized on-brand content across millions of touchpoints. For marketing professionals, Adobe Experience Platform and apps and purpose-built agents are redefining the future of customer connection by enabling real-time orchestration of content, data, and journeys.
Adobe's differentiation lies in our best-of-breed industry-leading applications across web content management, analytics, customer data platforms, commerce, journey orchestration, and workflow management. We're infusing AI in each of these solutions and combining creativity and marketing in GenStudio by bringing together creative ideation and production workflow, asset management, content delivery, and content analytics in a seamlessly integrated offering. While our AI-influenced ARR is already contributing billions of dollars, our AI book of business from AI products, such as Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly app and services, and Gen Studio for performance marketing, is tracking ahead of the $250 million ending ARR target by the end of fiscal 2025.
I'll now turn it over to David and Anil to discuss the momentum in our businesses.
David Wadhwani:
Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. In Q2, Digital Media achieved revenue of $4.35 billion, which grew 12% year over year. We exited the quarter with $18.09 billion of Digital Media ARR, growing ending ARR 12.1% year over year. We continue to see strong performance across our Business Professionals and Consumers group, where users are increasingly turning to Adobe for products that combine creativity and productivity. Virtually every business professional and consumer stands to benefit from AI-assisted consumption, visually rich creation, and natively integrated collaboration. Our investments in conversational experiences in Acrobat and generative AI models in Express allow users to combine the two products in novel ways, empowering users to accelerate their time to insight and ability to create compelling presentations.
Sales professionals can gather industry reports on a prospect, use AI assistant to quickly identify effective sales conversations, and automatically generate a pitch deck. With Express, a social media marketer can ask AI assistant for help identifying buying behaviors in market research documents and use that information to create better TikTok videos in Express. The combination of Acrobat and Express can help anyone move from consumption to creation faster with more impactful content than ever before.
As a result, we're seeing steady growth across our family of Acrobat and Express products, with combined monthly active user growth accelerating to over 25% year over year and crossing 700 million monthly active users, as Acrobat users increasingly rely on Acrobat AI Assistant to enhance content consumption and Express to create richer PDFs, customized presentations, and animated designs. Due to increasing customer demand for creative functionality through Acrobat, we saw an approximately 3x quarter over quarter and approximately 11x year over year increase in the adoption of Express capabilities within Acrobat. Subscription revenue for the Business Professionals and Consumers group grew 15% year over year.
We're rapidly acquiring the next generation business professionals and consumers across individuals, small and medium businesses, and enterprises. With students, we're driving over 75% year over year increase in students gaining access to Acrobat AI assistant and/or Express premium plans. These products are also seeing strong adoption by Express alone added around 8,000 new businesses this quarter. Businesses with over 35,000 new businesses added in Q2. Approximately 6x growth year over year, including companies such as Microsoft, ServiceNow, Workday, Intuit, and top sports leagues like MLB, the NFL, and Premier League. Other highlights include Acrobat PDF link sharing MAU grew over 20% year over year, helping to drive viral adoption.
Use of generative AI features continues to grow quickly, with AI Assistant MAU in Acrobat and generative AI MAU in Express growing over 3x year over year. Acrobat AI assistant engagement continues to accelerate, with the number of questions asked nearly doubling quarter over quarter. The Express ecosystem continues to expand, with partner add-ons growing more than 25% quarter over quarter, with new integrations from Google Ads, Vimeo, and Bitly. Select key global customer wins include Cisco, County of Los Angeles, the Defense Information Systems Agency, Macy's, Ulta Beauty. We're also seeing the rising importance of creative content across creative and marketing professionals.
Demand for creative capabilities across mediums, including imaging, design, photography, video, illustration, and 3D, is on the rise as individuals and businesses need visually compelling content to stand out in a crowded media landscape. Many individuals and organizations are turning to AI to develop high-quality content with more agility and efficiency. As a result, the Firefly app is becoming the Creative AI destination for Creative Cloud customers and new users alike to explore, ideate, create, and collaborate with AI workflows across media types. The Firefly app empowers anyone, from seasoned professionals to time creators, to generate multiple media formats in a single product with unmatched creative control and iterate on their creations across Adobe's creative apps.
The Firefly app benefits from our own commercially safe Firefly Foundation models across imaging, video, audio, vector, and design. Earlier this quarter, we launched the new Firefly Image Model 4 for lifelike images and the Firefly Image Model 4 Ultra for impeccable detail and complex visuals. We also made the Firefly video model generally available for the first time, empowering creators to generate 4K footage from text prompts and images with unprecedented creative control and extend video clips in our tools like Premiere Pro. In addition to supporting our own Firefly models, the Firefly app now supports a growing family of third-party models for creative ideation.
Firefly offers the flexibility to explore the diverse aesthetic styles of Google's Imagine and VO models, OpenAI's GPT image model, and Black Forest Labs' flux image model with runway, ideogram, fall AI, Luma, and PICA coming soon. With the release of the Firefly board's public beta earlier this quarter, creators can now ideate and collaborate when generating content with Firefly and our third-party models. To monetize this incredible innovation, we have introduced a comprehensive set of aimed at new and existing creators and creative professionals across all routes to market. The new Firefly app subscription plans are ideal for creators starting their creative journey and are now globally available.
Creative Cloud Pro, which combines Creative Cloud All apps and the Firefly app, represents the best value for content creation and is now available in North America. Creative Cloud Pro will be released in other geographies over the next few months. Other highlights include the launch of the new Firefly capabilities in February continues to drive excitement. Traffic to the Firefly app grew over 30% quarter over quarter, and paid subscriptions nearly doubled in the same period. Firefly continues to drive new user acquisition, with time Adobe subscribers growing more than 30% quarter over quarter.
We launched Photoshop Mobile and released major updates to our flagship Creative Cloud apps, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Substance at Max London, garnering over 350 million video views across social media. Excitement for and adoption of generative AI innovation such as generative fill in Photoshop, generative remove in Lightroom, generative expand in Illustrator, Generative Extend in Premiere Pro, video generation in the Firefly app, and production workflows in Services continues to accelerate with over 24 billion cumulative generations exiting Q2. Key customer wins include Cisco, County of San Diego, DEBT Holding, Fanatics, Infosys, Schwartz Global Sourcing, and Wells Fargo.
Creativity fuels the global economy and is the foundation of how marketers engage with their customers effectively across channels. As a result, we're seeing high enterprise demand for and adoption of Firefly services and custom models to automate and scale on-brand content production for marketing use cases. Adobe is uniquely positioned to lead the way in applying AI to amplify creativity across the full continuum of content creation. We're excited about the momentum we're seeing in both flagship apps and new offerings across our business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals groups.
Our growing base of monthly active users, accelerating use of generative AI, steady influx of new customers, inclusion of partner models, and accelerating adoption of automation services drove a strong quarter with digital media revenue of $4.35 billion, and we're pleased to raise our revenue target for the year. I'll now turn it over to Anil to talk about how this innovation is amplifying our momentum with marketing professionals.
Anil Chakravarthy:
Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Experience Cloud had a strong Q2, achieving revenue of $1.46 billion for the quarter. Subscription revenue in the quarter was $1.33 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth and making us the largest provider in our category. Content creation is the fuel driving personalized experiences at scale. Adobe is the only company unifying the entire workflow from creation and production, workflow and planning, asset management, delivery and activation, through to reporting and insights. Our customer experience orchestration strategy enables enterprises to combine creativity, marketing, and agentic AI to deliver personalized conversational digital experiences in real time at global scale. With Adobe Gen Studio, we're amplifying the value of cutting-edge Gen AI capabilities across the end-to-end content supply chain.
GenStudio optimizes the process of planning, creating, managing, activating, measuring content for marketing campaigns and personalized customer experiences. We launched GenStudio Foundation, a unified interface to bring together from our full suite of content supply chain applications providing visibility and actionable insights into campaign plans, projects, and assets. Gen Studio for performance marketing empowers teams to create their own on-brand content, supporting ad creation and activation on Google, LinkedIn, Meta, Microsoft, Snap, and TikTok. We're building on the momentum behind Firefly services and custom models, addressing additional highly desired solutions, including video reframe and support of third-party models for automation and cost efficiency.
With The Coca-Cola Company, we co-developed a new AI-powered design intelligence system called Project Vision, built on Firefly services and custom models. Project Vision is designed to scale creative output up to 10 times faster in AI-powered content while tackling the common challenge of misinterpreting brand guidelines. Adobe Experience Platform and native applications are central to delivering unified personalized customer experiences. With the introduction of AEP AI assistant, we've extended the platform's value by enabling teams across the business to interact with data through natural language, streamlining ingestion, insight generation, audience segmentation, and experience delivery. Building on this momentum, we are now expanding AEP with native AI agents that intelligently orchestrate customer journeys in real time.
These innovations empower our customers to leverage their third-party customer data and deliver more relevant, high-impact advertising experiences rooted in direct customer relationships. The National Football League expanded our global partnership, combining content data and journeys to deliver a new level of AI-powered fan experiences. Adobe will enable all 32 clubs to scale personalized fan touchpoints across NFL channels through project management, audience and campaign development, creative production, and performance optimization. Adobe Summit in March, we introduced the Adobe AI platform with an agentic layer to scale customer experience orchestration. We unveiled 10 agents purpose-built for creative marketing technology teams that leverage Adobe Experience Platform to act intelligently and in alignment with business goals.
These agents coordinate across systems to accelerate the delivery of exceptional experiences. We recently launched a product support agent to help enterprises anticipate, troubleshoot, and resolve operational issues. Customers like Wegmans Food Markets, Dentsu Merkel are already using it to streamline onboarding and feature deployment and drive faster resolutions and greater efficiency. Other highlights include strong demand for AEP and native apps, with Q2 subscription revenue growing over 40% year over year. Momentum for Gen Studio for performance marketing with growth of over 45% quarter over quarter. Continued demand for Firefly services and custom models as part of the GenStudio solution resulting in 4x year over year ARR growth.
The release of AEM Sites Optimizer garnered tremendous interest from customers like Qualcomm eager to tap its agentic capabilities, usability, and security for valuable insights and recommendations to improve their website's performance. Industry analyst recognition, including being named a leader in the Forrester Wave for collaborative work management for the consecutive time, IDC MarketScape for worldwide connected TV advertising platforms, and the Gartner Magic Quadrant for content marketing platforms with Gen Studio solutions, including Workfront, Adobe Gen Studio for performance marketing, Creative Cloud, Firefly, and Express.

Shantanu Narayen:
Thanks, Dan. Our strong Q2 performance highlights our momentum and how we're leveraging AI to drive exponential value in the creative economy. As a result of our strategy and execution, we're confident in our ability to deliver value to existing customers and attract new users. I'm incredibly proud of how our teams around the world continue to create the future, raise the bar, and bring our purpose to life. Adobe continues to attract great talent, and we're excited to welcome new college graduates and interns to help us change the world through personalized digital experiences. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator,
Operator:
Thank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press 1 on your touch-tone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is 1 if you would like. The question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.
Saket Kalia:
Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. David, maybe David and Shantanu, maybe for both of you, you know, the merging of creativity and productivity definitely seemed thematic. And maybe around that, it's interesting to see the growing adoption of Express within Acrobat. And may can you just maybe talk about why that combo works and how does the pricing work there? Does the customer subscribe to both or just one? Thanks.
David Wadhwani:
Great. Thanks, Saket. Yes. As you as we've talked about for quite a while, seeing an absolute explosion in the demand for, you know, content creation and more and more visually content creation. The reason this works and why Acrobat and Express are really, you know, effectively part of the same value proposition to business professionals and consumers, is that there's been a significant amount of work that we've done, research we've seen where content consumption for many people is really the beginning of a content creation process.
As I've mentioned in the past, when we launched AI assistant, about a year ago now, what we started noticing is that as people were having conversations with the documents they were using, the very next step or one of the last steps they did was basically ask the AI assistant to write a summary for an email or write an outline for a presentation. Or give it stats for an infographic. Right? And so what we've done here is we've brought these products together. And, if you are using Acrobat, you are able to get access to all of the capabilities of Express and what you get as part of freemium there.
But what you will expect to see is more and more deeper integration of the two going forward, and we have a lot of exciting things to share in the back half of this year around that.
Saket Kalia:
Very helpful. Thank you. And the next question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.
Mark Murphy:
Thank you so much and congratulations on the beat and raise performance. I noticed on the Adobe Stock website that the volume of video content really took off during Q2. Positively. And I'm interested in just what you see happening there to drive the contributor uploaded content higher, then also just having seen the news with the Disney and NBCUniversal, you know, filing a copyright lawsuit that related to some of the AI-generated imagery. I'm just curious if you have any view that might validate the Adobe strategy of being commercially safe. And, you know, having the content and if you think there's any ramifications of that.
David Wadhwani:
Yeah. Thanks for the question. You know, one of the things I think if you aggregate the question, the way you're asking it, I mean, I think one of the core principles for Adobe has and continues to be that we have a great deal of respect for content creators. We want to make sure and help them monetize content, the content they create in any way possible, because we think it's just good for the industry.
One of the things that we've been doing over the last many years is taking Adobe Stock from being this independent capability and just integrating it throughout so more users get more value and the demand for content it continues to grow is really at their fingertips. And as a result, if someone's using Express or if someone's using Creative Cloud, or if someone's using Firefly boards, they're able to access this incredible, you know, set of content that's being developed by the community.
More recently, to your point, we expanded that set to invest in a lot of what we call creative missions so people can submit more video content and video content of all forms for all different kinds of outputs, whether it's vertically oriented or horizontally oriented. And as that corpus of video content has been building up, we're seeing a lot more pull-through. And so the whole economy around that is working.
And then secondly, you know, to the point you were making around, you know, the training data set and how we train and compensate creators, this has been one of the core things that we believe, you know, from the very beginning, is that the right transparent and really the only commercially safe way to build these models is to do it on a set of content where the contributors are themselves, you know, excited and willing participants in the process. And so we have trained our Firefly models, as many of you know, on stock and other content that we have access to. We do have a contributor fund that pays out to those individuals.
And as a result, we feel like we're in a very advantaged position when it comes to people choosing Model Health, especially in enterprises. We see a lot of companies selecting Firefly partially because of the quality, partially because of the controllability of it, but also very, very strongly because of the safety of it. And we believe that it's just the right way to approach it, and we believe it's a safe bet for the long term in this industry.
Shantanu Narayen:
And Mark, maybe if I were to just add. I think on the as it relates to the other services, they've all just really focused on the tip of the iceberg in terms of ideation. And I think Firefly with the for all of those models, will be the ultimate creative destination and to you know, I think punctuate what David said. In the enterprise, the value proposition that we have resonates. Because even if you use it for ideation, you're not gonna use something that's not been designed to be intellectually, yeah, the intellectual property being correct. For production. And so I think that's why you're gonna continue to see our stuff being used for scale production.
Because it's so unique.
Mark Murphy:
Excellent. Thank you so much. And the next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne:
David, I was wondering if you could walk through sort of the initial reaction to the change on, you know, the Creative Cloud Pro. You know, what you're seeing on that front, and then sort of what you might be expecting in terms of those changes in the half of the year from a revenue perspective? Thanks.
David Wadhwani:
Yeah. If we take a step back and this is one that we have been, I think, fairly consistent over the last few years in terms of our core strategy. And we reiterated it at Summit a few months ago, is that, again, the demand for content has been, you know, almost insatiable. The number of, you know, people wanting to create richer content has been very strong. And one of the things that we've talked about is that, historically, you know, Creative Cloud was, you know, a single offer, whether it's Creative Cloud All apps or Creative Cloud Pro, really doing double duty or triple duty across the entire ecosystem of people wanting to create content.
And so we've been very methodically over the last couple of years extending the offering lineup. Right, so that we can meet the needs of business professionals and consumers with Acrobat and Express. We can meet the needs of creators with the new Firefly plans that we've released recently, whether it's Firefly Standard for in The US, $10, Firefly Pro for $20, or Firefly Premium, which has unlimited access to video generation as well, for $200 a month. And for Creative Pros, we've been adding very steadily, we've been adding more and more of these capabilities directly in the tools, the desktop tools they know and love and use every single day.
The value they're getting out of it is enormous. We talked about the fact that we've crossed 24 billion generations to date. And as a result, we've been able to introduce the Creative Cloud Pro plan, which is a higher-priced plan, but has a lot more value integrated into the ecosystem of the desktop applications. But it also comes with the Firefly application as well. Then in the context of enterprises, we're seeing a huge growth of Firefly services and GenStudio for automation of that content. That really fits into what we've been talking about as our monetization architecture p times q plus v. Right? Where quantity growth comes from the business pro and consumer.
We talked about how Acrobat and Express is seeing strong MAU growth at 25% year over year, crossing 700 million. Quantity also comes from the Firefly app. We talked about traffic being up 30% quarter over quarter. We talked about 2x subs growth there. 30% growth in terms of new users to Adobe quarter over quarter, for Firefly. In terms of the pricing part of that equation, we, you know, we're about the increased value that we have in Creative Cloud Pro. That gives us some opportunity to match the value we're providing the pricing. And then in terms of the value is around Firefly services and GenStudio. So that's really the growth algorithm.
The thing to note is that, you know, as we go down this path, some of this will take some time to play out because we have, you know, for the quantity side, we have freemium and lower price offers, but we're starting to see the early signs of that. And if you do the math and know, maybe turn it over to Dan, if you do the math, our core creative business, subscription revenue has been accelerating over the past few quarters.
Dan Durn:
Yeah. And just to build on that, David, you know, if you take a look at the supplemental disclosure that we provided, between the subscription revenue for creative and marketing professionals, the subscription revenue for DX, you can pretty quickly derive what the subscription revenue is for the creative and Creative Pro audience that we serve. And when you think about the acceleration over the last I think what you'll see is in the current quarter, it growing 10.1% year over year, which is up from 10% in Q1. Four or five quarters, you know, in the year ago, period, that same 10.1% would have been about 7.9%. So just over 2% acceleration over the last four quarters.
So we feel good about the way the strategy is unfolding and our ability to execute against that growth strategy.
David Wadhwani:
Kirk, to your other question about how this rolls out, just to be clear, it's you know, all this happens on renewal and so, you know, the good news is it's all ahead of us. In terms of where that happens, and we'll roll it out in enterprise. We'll roll it out in regions. And so, you know, the good news is that the initial feedback has been good, but it's early as it relates to, you know, the rollout. So that just speaks to the organic strength.
Kirk Materne:
Thank you all.
Operator:
And the next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi.
Tyler Radke:
Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about, you know, overall Gen AI usage versus monetization. In the quarter, it looked like you saw another quarter of about 4 billion Firefly generations, which is a huge number, but I think that's, you know, been pretty consistent with what you've seen in the last two quarters. So, you know, two questions. Are you pleased with that level? You know, are there things that you're doing to increase the generations of that? And then of that 4 billion, like, how far through the monetization are you?
I mean, it seems like seeing a lot of good success in terms of new users to the Firefly standalone apps and you know, on track on some of the standalone AI targets for the year. So just help us, you know, think through the monetization and kind of that usage incentivization, dynamics here.
Shantanu Narayen:
Yeah, Tyler. I think underlying, you know, the numbers, there's been a fair amount of rearchitecture to make sure that AI is really driving it. I mean, even at the financial analyst meeting, we talked about the AI-influenced revenue and the AI direct revenue. The AI-influenced revenue is already in the billions because that speaks to the value that people are getting across both, you know, our DX products, Acrobat products, as well as, you know, the creative products. So across the board, there's no question that AI is being a nice tailwind as it relates to adoption. And we also said we're tracking ahead of the $250 million. The immense opportunity is all ahead of us.
And as we get this entire offering that we keep talking about, which is Acrobat, Express, Firefly Single App, Creative Cloud Pro, which includes Firefly, Gen Studio, and, you know, the AEP and apps. Each one of them, we think, has tremendous opportunity ahead of us. So it's very early in terms of the AI monetization, but we're very advanced in terms of how much innovation we've delivered. And so, you know, it feels really good right now.
Tyler Radke:
Thank you. And the next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.
Alex Zukin:
Yes. Hey, guys. Maybe just one two-part question for me, and that's on the topic of competition. It looks at least by our math, it looks like Express is now at 50 million MAUs. So maybe just comment on the competitive environment that you're seeing down market with some of the disruptors. And then with respect to outside of your traditional competitive environment, maybe just coopetition with vendors like Meta where it at least it's a little harder for some investors to understand given their increasing usage of AI to automate, you know, kind of ad creation and campaign optimization. To what extent does that overlap versus partner with some of the GenStudio offerings?
Think it be helpful to just go into that a little bit.
David Wadhwani:
Great. Yeah. Maybe I'll start, and I'll hand it over to Shantanu and Anil to address the part. When it comes to the growth of our new web and mobile offerings, you know, if you look at everything we've been doing with Express, everything we've been doing with the launch of Photoshop on mobile. Of course, Firefly is on the web, and we've said that it's coming to mobile soon as well. We have a Lightroom, of course, also being a very significant part of that.
You know, what we've been doing over the last few years is taking that data-driven operating model that we've perfected in terms of the web journeys and really reallocating it, you know, all of the at a significant part of what we've learned there from top of funnel generation to, you know, performance marketing to conversion and retention, to virality, you know, that entire ecosystem has been flowing very well. A lot of that we learned with what we were doing with Acrobat, and now we're applying it to the other areas. You know, the other thing that has been playing in our benefit, especially with something like Express, is the broader ecosystem.
One of the things that has been most exciting to see is that Express adoption within businesses. We talked about how 8,000 onboarded into 8,000 new businesses in the quarter with Express. We mentioned a number of really great logos obviously, with Intuit and Cisco and the NFL and Premier League entering these things. And what's really great about that is it's really part of an enterprise-wide content supply chain. Sale where Express is integrated with AEM, Express is integrated with Workfront, and it's a way of taking all the work that we're doing on the DX side of the business, and empowering more people to participate in that and create content that's on brand.
Shantanu Narayen:
I think the two things that I'd just maybe add to that is, as it relates to even, I think what you're calling the low end when you consider, you know, the business professionals and consumers. The amount of model that we have, you know, is very significant. So I just wanted to make sure that you understand that because they all use a lot of the products that are perhaps, you know, referred to within the creative professionals. But I think to your other point, as it relates to, you know, the amount of content that's being created digital advertising, and the third-party support, already announced a whole bunch of third-party support.
You're gonna see a whole bunch more announced. And every, you know, sort of advertising platform, if that's what I can call it, wants the Adobe partnership as it relates to GenStudio for performance marketing. I think initially, you'll probably see SMEs, you know, go with perhaps a more proprietary channel. But I think across each one of these channels, we're gonna be the one company that people look at to make sure that in a seamless collaboration, they can post. It's to Microsoft, whether it's to Google, whether it's to, you know, Snap, TikTok, Meta, you name all of them, Amazon. All of these come online, they will be using our Gen Studio for performance market.
But I'll have Anil also talk about some of the other things, and hopefully, you know, you'll track what we are doing at Cannes as well.
Anil Chakravarthy:
Thanks, Shantanu. Yeah. As Shantanu mentioned, you know, in terms of the ad platforms, obviously, the primary goal is to grow the ad revenue. The best way to do that is to make sure that the creative is optimized and the ROI from the advertiser's perspective is clear to the advertisers, which is where our marketing stack, everything that we're doing around GenStudio for performance marketing comes together really well. And so, you know, we already announced at Summit, including Meta, and a number of others, including Google and so on, and next week at Cannes. Be announcing all the other major platforms as well.
Alex Zukin:
Would love to join you guys and can, but thank you for answering the question, guys. And we'll take a question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss:
Excellent. Thank you guys for fitting me in, and congratulations on a solid quarter. Dan, just like two clarification questions on the guidance for the year. You guys talked about the changes in the all apps Creative Cloud pricing, already being reflected in guidance. This is the time or this is or an example of you guys stratifying that pricing and there's an ability for people to sort of upsell or to the pro or sort of get a lower-priced edition with the standard. How did you guys think about that mix? Any guidance you could give us on sort of your assumptions on where customers go number one.
And number two, any change in the FX assumptions on the revenue side of the equation for the guide for the full year?
Shantanu Narayen:
Yes. Keith, maybe I'll start off by saying that. I mean, I think as it relates to a creative professional, we want CC Pro to be the sweet spot. For, you know, where the majority of users will go. It's not dissimilar to what we've done where, let's get more Firefly app adoption. Let's get more adoption of the AI features within the desktop applications. And move them to CC Pro being the best product as they also experience what we are doing with ideation and multiple products. So, you know, the goal there is clear. You know, all of the AI and generative capability will increasingly be best available for our customers through the CCPro application.
On the other hand, that takes a while as it comes to renewal if they have annual cycles. So that's the other thing that you have to think about. And as we roll that out in different regions. But from our perspective, we want CC Pro and Firefly app to be, you know, the sweet spot of how this emerges. But we also believe that CC, you know, standard as well as Firefly single app will continue to be meaningful parts of the business and then on-ramp to the others. So hopefully, answers your question on mix.
Keith Weiss:
And on the FX side of the equation?
Dan Durn:
Yeah. I think on the FX, I'll go and then certainly we can add. I mean, as you think about, you know, what we've done with our DME revenue, there are two things that are, you know, impacting the strength in the revenue. There's some FX. I mean, think of that as maybe a small part of where you're seeing the benefit. The vast majority of the benefit is really happening as a result of how we're driving ARR and the revenue conversion for the business. So, you know, hopefully, that helps in terms of how you think about, you know, what role FX has played in our business.
But the vast majority of, you know, the raise has to do with, you know, ARR performance as it relates to the revenue conversion of that into revenue.
Keith Weiss:
Excellent. Thanks for the clarification.
Operator:
And we'll go to Brent Thill with Jefferies.
Brent Thill:
Thanks. Shantanu, you used double-digit growth as your true north for growing the company. Think everyone's curious with AI. Are you less or more bullish on that 10% true north that you've been talking through?
Shantanu Narayen:
Well, Brent, I mean, let's look at some of the facts. And maybe, you know, as we think about, you know, what's happened in the business, you know, I think at the FA meeting, we tried to talk about, hey. While the growth on growth, and this is what you folks have been talking about for net new ARR, has been relatively consistent. I mean, we have reaffirmed DME ARR for the quarter, and that's 11%.
When you look at it also in the new model that we're providing by customer segments, and you think about what's happening between the business professional and consumer and what's happening on creative and marketing professionals, you saw, I think, the revenue growth was 15%, and 10 or 11 depending on whether you take as reported or constant currency. And I think Dan alluded to this. What has really been gratifying for us to see is when you look at the creative subscription revenue growth, now that you have these additional disclosures. You will see relative to Q2 of 2024 versus 2023, and then you look at it as Q2 of 2025 versus 2024, it's also at 10% growth.
So, you know, what we've been talking about, which is retooling the business, is happening. And so, yes, the opportunity is there. We wanna, you know, make sure that we invest in AI. To enable more people to use the platform. And, yes, that's really been the focus. And then on the other side, the business and consumer side, that's been growing around 15%. So as I think about the growth initiatives, Brent, to answer your question, on the business professional and the things that you have to think about is AI. An AI assistant with a single document with multiple documents. Increasing, you know, the relevance and usage of Acrobat.
Think as it relates to Express, if you look at it Express standalone, the fact that in the post-template era, AI will even further the ability for people to take the story that they have in their head and make sure that's available. You're seeing the momentum in that business. But, again, really, there, the North Star is the combination of creativity and product driving. You know, growth for us. We never talk enough, I think, about the marketing. And, you know, what kind of a strength that is. If you look at our marketing performance, we look at what others are also at this scale reporting. It's clear that we're, you know, growing our business faster than them.
The impact of the content and the marketing business, you know, we continue to be really bullish about it. And for those who sometimes say, wow, your seats are not growing, and automation will take over. Guess what? We're the leader in automation. But we think it's really a combination of both of that also make us really unique. I know the question that came up earlier. I'll just touch on that again. I do believe the fact that Firefly has been designed to be, you know, preserve intellectual attributes of people, that is going to become an increasingly important thing in the enterprise. Everybody is experimenting with it. It becomes mainstream, that's gonna be.
So, yes, Brent, the short answer is I'm more bullish about it, and I'm what I'm really pleased about is underlying 2025 how we've re-architected the business to be this AI-driven growth.
Brent Thill:
Thank you, Shantanu.
Operator:
And our next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.
Jay Vleeschhouwer:
Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, since you alluded earlier to headcount, maybe we can focus on the permanent part of your headcount, not just the summer interns. And there's some very interesting trends there with regard to where you're looking to add in terms of open positions. And in the last few months, including very recently, there are four specific areas where there's some prevalence of functions, and I'd like to ask you about those. And go to market, number one. Number two, product management, Number three, strategy. And number four, marketing, both across DME and DX.
So maybe talk about some of the rationales or needs that you have internally with regard to where you're looking to add in those respects.
Shantanu Narayen:
Sure, Jay. I mean, I think if Dan were answering the question, he would say as you look at the Q1 versus Q2 versus Q1 expense, you'll see that we're investing in the right areas. Given the innovation roadmap, being able to ensure that we, you know, in conjunction with the launches, market the product. Express, you know, we still need to get more awareness of it. The product's great. We really focused on going big in a few countries. We're seeing dramatic improvement as a result of that focus.
So the marketing investment is clearly as a result of making sure that we invest a lot more to ensure that the launches that we have and the product roadmap that we have the awareness is high. I think on product management, the sort of theme that David and Anil would probably talk about is PLG. How PLG is really helping it. The refinements that people are making and, you know, the traditional way of releasing products, Jay, used to be that you know, you design a product and then you'd release it. Now it's the ongoing iteration. And, you know, we measure every single morning.
And so I think the product management has to do a lot with, you know, how we invest in the right PLG motions? To make sure that's happening. Strategy, I mean, again, I think AI will offer folks a lot more. We've talked about, you know, on data models, agents, and interfaces, you know, how we continue to be well-positioned. And so I think on strategy, it's the interfaces and the agentic stuff that we're focused on. But I should also clarify. At large, we're not really looking to grow our headcount very dramatically. We are finding a lot more efficiency. People are, you know, using AI to be more efficient within the enterprise.
So you're right about the focus areas. But the real increase this quarter, I think, had to do more with interns. And we love hiring more interns because it's a try before you buy both ways. Right? And the fact that we're such an attractive place for people to come, you know, I'm really excited about the number of people who want to come to Adobe, you know, on that side.
Operator:
We have time for one more question.
Operator:
Thank you. And that question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.
Kash Rangan:
Hi, Shantanu and team. Goldman Sachs loves your shares, your love for interns. Our interns also just started. So the question for your business is, clearly, there's a lot of innovation happening in AI. And when you look at the targets for AI, you got the $125 million book of business projected to go to $250 million. Is there any evidence at all that you can point to with your DDOM or maybe other sources that the push towards AI, be it through Firefly or Gen Studio, is actually visibly, tangibly, quantifiably moving the pace of creative adoption and driving business to a larger degree than what's possible without AI.
So in other words, you have an AI bucket of revenue, which is what it is. And the core. Any evidence to suggest that the core is tangibly being energized and is poised for some growth curve ahead. It's easy to extrapolate the 10, 11% like Brent was talking about. Right? But where could we be wrong in not seeing that change of that curve and the adoption that you might be seeing and may not be manifest in financial metrics, but maybe you see things under the hood.
That give you the conviction that we're at the beginning of that curve of adoption that could lead the company to a phase of growth that we kinda saw in the 04/1418 time frame when people, like, strongly extrapolated the flattish trends in the on-prem business and then the cloud really just took off. Right? Is there any evidence?
Shantanu Narayen:
Yeah. Kash. I think what I would point to is maybe three things from the DDOM as you refer to it. On the new book of business. You know, if you build a new book of business that's going from 0 to $250 million, I think most people would say, you know, that's pretty phenomenal because these are products, whether it's Acrobat AI assistant, the new Firefly app, Firefly services, you know, which is, you know, continues to rock frankly and Gen Studio for performance marketing. Those are pretty good. So that, you know, on one vector, you look at it and say, we're driving new businesses, and the scale is good.
Clearly, you know, at our scale, the bigger metric that we track is in DX. Let's talk about DX. And in DX, how much of this technology that we have been delivering is being adopted? What is the scale at which, you know, we're driving, whether it's campaigns, whether it's engagement through email or SMS, the amount of transactions that are going through AEP and apps. And all of that is because the agility of marketing, the ability to personalize these experiences with customers is dramatically increasing. So that's one underlying trend that we clearly see. And the demand for that is only increasing and not decreasing.
I think in David's business, whether it's in Acrobat or whether it's in the creative products, is generations, which means our people using AI to be more productive. And the output. You know, I think last quarter, we had talked about, hey. Even Express, it's gone over a billion exports. So those are sort of the two underlying. That, as we have always said, is sort of this influence revenue. But, you know, the influence revenue and the underlying usage point to the fact that adoption is good. So, hopefully, that gives you, you know, some insight into how we're looking at it, which is the core products that we have that are driving this $20 billion.
Are we making sure that usage and retention and adoption of the new features, you know, implies that people are seeing value in it. And then on the new ones, hey, are we building these new businesses that allow us to create new offerings like CC Pro? Like Acrobat with, you know, AI assistant, and Acrobat and AI assistant and Express. And I think those are sort of some of the underlying trends that we see. The ultimate tier, which is this is the new AI tiers or prime tiers within the enterprise. So those are some of the underlying early indicators to your point. And, Mark, and MAU just means that, hey.
This premium model is attracting a new set of customers. That allows us to feel confident about go-forward prospects for the company. But since that's the last question, and I think we're out of time, you know, maybe I'll just sort of summarize. We're really pleased with the first half performance. The fact that we continue to, you know, drive both top line and bottom line. Is something that's meaningful to us. And, you know, we're focused on driving continued success for this in the second half and beyond. We look forward to sharing more at our next earnings call. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Steve.
Steve Day:
Okay. That ends the call. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day."

Full Conference Call Transcript
Shantanu Narayen:
Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In fiscal 2025, Adobe delivered significant AI-influenced and AI-first ending ARR, which accelerated through the year. We achieved record revenue of $23.77 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $20.94, which represents outstanding financial performance. We are leveraging AI to accelerate innovation to anticipate and serve the needs of large and expanding audiences: business professionals and consumers, creators and creative professionals, and marketing professionals. Our vision for business professionals and consumers is to deliver AI-driven quick and easy applications that enable them to be creative and productive, consuming or generating content across multiple media types and channels.
We do this by delivering new conversational and agentic interfaces in Adobe Reader, Acrobat, and Express to provide a freemium integrated experience for billions of users. For creators and creative pros, our vision is to deliver the most comprehensive, power, and precision applications from ideation and creation to production and delivery. We've done an outstanding job of both creating our own commercially safe FIREFLY models as well as seamlessly integrating third-party partner models across Creative Cloud flagship applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere.
With the Firefly application, we're giving creators a rich set of generative AI capabilities that allow users to generate with Adobe and partner models, ideate with Firefly boards, and create and edit videos and images through conversational experiences blended with direct manipulation. Along with the Firefly app, we've introduced new products like premium mobile with YouTube integration and Photoshop mobile to further serve creators anywhere they create. We're transforming the enterprise content supply chain by integrating creative applications, workflow management, asset management, Firefly services, and custom models with Firefly Foundry.
We have the most comprehensive vision for marketing professionals, whether they are freelancers or working at an agency or within an enterprise, to create a brand or address the expanding needs of the content supply chain in the era of AI to deliver customer experience orchestration solutions. Adobe Experience Platform and apps power customer engagement and loyalty. Adobe Experience Manager and AgenTic Web Solutions, including LLM Optimizer, Sites Optimizer, and Brand Concierge, deliver brand visibility and discovery. And Adobe Gen Studio enables enterprises to optimize their full contact supply chain to realize true personalization at scale.
FY '25 accomplishments and highlights include establishing ourselves within leading AI ecosystems with partnerships and integrations across AWS, Azure, Google Gemini, Humane, Microsoft Copilot, OpenAI, and others, offering unprecedented access, choice, and flexibility to customers. Leading the way in AI innovation around conversational and agentic interfaces, including products like LLM Optimizer and Acrobat AI Assistant, creating custom models through Firefly services, Firefly Foundry, and GenStudio, as well as infusing AI within our applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Express, and Premiere. We continue to leverage inorganic strategies to deliver more value to customers and are pleased with our recently announced intent to acquire SEMRush to help brands enhance their visibility and expand audience reach.
Driving significant new user acquisition across individuals and enterprises, with products including Acrobat, Creative Cloud, Express, and Firefly, achieving total MAU growth of greater than 15% year over year. Accelerating adoption of our AI functionality by enterprise customers further highlights our leadership and their trust in Adobe's ability to deliver AI value seamlessly across workflows. In Q4, globally, we drove record bookings of deals greater than $1 million and achieved over 25% year-over-year growth in the number of customers with $10 million plus in ARR. Our customer group strategy, large market opportunity, and product innovation drove strong FY 2025 results.
This is the foundation for our FY 2026 total Adobe ARR growth target of over 10%, and we're focused on accelerating this momentum beyond FY 2026. I'll now turn it over to David.
David Wadhwani:
Thanks, Shantanu. Hello, everyone. Digital Media had a record Q4, driven by user acquisition and expanded customer value across business professionals and consumers, and creators and creative professionals underpinned by two big areas of innovation: generative AI models and agentic experiences. Digital media achieved revenue of $4.62 billion in Q4 and full-year revenue of $17.65 billion, both of which grew 11% year over year. We exited the quarter with $19.2 billion of digital media ARR, growing ending ARR 11.5% year over year. As it relates to generative AI models, we have continued to develop our own commercially safe FIREFLY models while dramatically expanding our ecosystem of GenAI model partnerships.
The new Firefly Image five model is performing incredibly well with generation quality, native four-megapixel resolution, and industry-leading prompt-based editing capabilities. At Adobe MAX in October, we significantly expanded Firefly to become the only app with our own commercially safe models and over 25 leading partner models, including Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Luma, Runway, Topaz Labs, and Eleven Labs. These models are now integrated into our FIREFLY Express and Creative Cloud applications. We also announced advanced model capabilities, including custom model support for Firefly and Creative Cloud customers. Usage and monetization of new Adobe and third-party models is measured and charged through generative credits.
Different models, FIREFLY, GEMINI, or FLEX, for example, and different media types, video, and high-resolution images, for example, consume different quantities of generative credits. Generative credits are a great indicator of high-value usage, and credit consumption increased three x quarter over quarter. As subscribers consume more generative credits, they have the choice of moving to higher-value Creative Cloud offerings or acquiring Firefly credit add-ons. We also took a huge step forward in Q4 as we showcased the work we've been doing to atomize Photoshop Express and Acrobat capabilities as model context protocol endpoints at Adobe MAX.
In addition to delivering applications, we are providing imaging, video, and productivity functionality in ChatGPT Copilot and other conversational platforms in order to deliver and monetize creative and PDF functionality in new surfaces. Users will be able to work conversationally while still benefiting from the power and precision of Adobe's industry-leading features and direct manipulation tools, making it easier than ever to go from intent to outcome, whether editing a PDF, refining an image, or generating a design. The advances in generative models and agentic capabilities position Adobe well to take advantage of the long-term opportunities servicing business professionals and consumers, and creator and creative professional audiences.
Our vision for business professionals and consumers is to deliver AI-driven, quick and easy applications that enable users to be creative and productive, whether consuming or generating content across multiple media types and channels. The strategy is showing real traction, and we are driving strong business momentum. We revolutionized how users consume and comprehend documents by introducing Acrobat AI assistant in FY 24, and recently added PDF spaces, allowing individuals and teams to create knowledge hubs to collaborate across multiple documents. Users package multiple documents, not just PDFs, but other file types and web links, into a single workspace they can share with others, enabling a collaborative conversational experience.
Usage of these AI features inside Acrobat and Reader has grown more than four x year over year. As users increasingly turn to Acrobat to help them discover insights, synthesize new ideas, and share knowledge. Adobe Xpress made significant advances in Q4 with the introduction of an AI assistant capable of generative content creation and complex editing. Express now supports generative presentations and designs, moving the industry into a post-template world. Express AI assistant is capable of conversationally editing images, flyers, presentations, infographics, and more. Innovations like these have contributed to significant express MAU growth. Adobe Acrobat Studio brings together the conversational consumption and comprehension capabilities of AI assistant and PDF spaces with the generative creation power of Express.
Alongside the PDF tools people know and rely on into a unified offer. Customer reception of Acrobat Studio has been strong, with nearly 50% of Acrobat commercial ETLAs renewed in Q4 already upgrading to this offering. Reflecting user enthusiasm for unified document comprehension and content generation. FY '25 business professional and consumer accomplishments and highlights include continued growth of Acrobat Web, which saw MAU increase over 30% year over year, strong adoption of Express and Education, with over 70% year over year growth of students with access to express premium. Over 45 new partners added to the Express in Q4, including Binder, Bootsuite, and Sprout Social.
Over 25,000 businesses purchased Express or Studio for the first time in Q4 alone, accelerating quarter over quarter. And key enterprise customer wins include Allianz, American Automobile Association, Bundeswehr von Duschland, Nippon Life, PwC, Sony, and the US Navy. Turning to creators and creative professionals, our vision is to deliver the most comprehensive power and precision applications from ideation and creation to production and delivery. We continue to succeed in our goal to attract the next generation of content creators, provide creative professionals with game-changing generative AI capabilities, and automate content production at scale in enterprises. We are attracting new creators to Adobe through the Firefly application, which can be purchased through our Firefly standard, pro, and premium subscription plans.
Firefly has a rich set of generative AI capabilities that allow users to generate with Adobe and partner models, ideate with Firefly boards, and create and edit videos and images. Simply put, Firefly is a one-stop shop for accessing industry-leading models integrated into rich creative workflows at an affordable price. In addition, we're seeing strong adoption of Firefly from Creative Cloud customers as they embrace the growing breadth of AI models and tools seamlessly integrated into creative workflows. We drove two x quarter over quarter growth in first-time subscriptions of Firefly. The release of Premier Mobile in Q4 marks an important milestone in next-generation AI video editing.
In partnership with Google and YouTube, we are introducing AI-driven audio and video tools to streamline how creators remix YouTube Shorts, which receive 200 billion daily views. Creative Cloud delivered massive new value at Adobe MAX, including the release of new models for generative fill, upscaling, and prompt editing in Photoshop, reflection removal in Lightroom, turntable in Illustrator, and smart masking in Premiere. We also announced the general availability of Firefly boards, a new ideation surface that brings together everything creative professionals need to explore visual and design concepts with stakeholders using industry-leading models from Adobe and our partners. Use of AI in these applications continues to accelerate, underscoring the impact AI is having on what creative professionals can produce.
As part of the overall content supply chain solution for marketing use cases, we continue to advance automated content production with Firefly services that include video resizing, video reframing, image composition, image harmonization, digital twin generation, and more. We also announced Adobe Firefly Foundry at Max, which delivers enterprises with proprietary foundation models trained on their own content, data, and brand catalogs. Interest in Firefly Foundry has been strong from enterprise marketing teams and media and entertainment companies, where there is increasing desire to produce content faster and more cost-effectively.
FY '25 creator and creative professional accomplishments and highlights include hosting Adobe MAX, the world's largest creativity event with over 10,000 members of the creative community in attendance, with millions more online. The tremendous innovations we showcased earned over 2,000 articles and garnered 820 million video views. Growing our base of creative users across 70 million in Q4, growing over 35% year over year. Accelerating adoption of Firefly services within enterprises, accelerating generative credit consumption in Creative Cloud, Firefly, and Express with over 100 new deals signed in Q4 by individuals and enterprises, which grew approximately three x quarter over quarter. Strength across all routes to market and geographies, with particular strength in SMB, enterprise, and emerging markets.
And key enterprise wins include Coca Cola, Humane, IKEA, JPMorgan Chase, Lowe's, Nintendo, and Sony. Over the last few years, we have extended our lineup to anticipate and serve the diverse needs of creative users. The continued strength of Creative Cloud, generative credits, and Firefly automation underscores the success of this strategy with creative professionals across both individuals and enterprises. The accelerated growth of creative freemium MAU demonstrates success with offerings that target creators, consumers, and business professionals and is already starting to have an impact, as evident in our Q4 results and FY 2026 targets. Overall, we delivered strong business results and record Digital Media net new ARR in Q4, and are excited about the opportunity in FY 2026.
I'll now turn it over to Anil.
Anil Chakravarthy:
Thanks, David. Hello, everyone. Our success serving creative and marketing professionals in the enterprise has been driven by having the most comprehensive vision for customer experience orchestration, enabling enterprises around the world to deliver personalized experiences at scale in the era of AI. Digital experience had a strong close to the year, achieving revenue of $1.52 billion for the quarter, and a record $5.86 billion in revenue in FY 2025. Subscription revenue in the quarter was $1.41 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth. Adobe delivers a unified AI-powered platform for customer experience orchestration, spanning brand visibility, content supply chain, and customer engagement.
Adobe Experience Platform is a leading customer data platform that serves as the foundation in enterprises for digital customer engagement and brings together new AI-powered apps and agents to drive engagement and loyalty as well as to reduce costs. Our platform operates at scale with over 35 trillion segment evaluations and more than 70 billion profile activations per day. We released six new AI agents powered by AEP agent rator to transform how businesses build, deliver, and optimize marketing campaigns and customer experiences. Subscription revenue for AEP and native apps grew over 40% year over year, demonstrating our continued leadership.
We have the best pulse on digital conversations across search, social media, and LLMs and enable marketers to get a unified view of where online traffic is originating, how to create and promote brands, and drive engagement and commerce. In fact, our most recent Adobe Digital Index data, which is based on online transactions across more than 1 trillion visits to US retail sites, shows that generative AI traffic is up 760% thus far, the 2025 holiday season. Our data shows that AI-powered traffic from LLMs and agentic browsers is rising and requires different approaches to conversion, underscoring the growing importance of the agentic web and our opportunity to provide insights and automation to marketers.
Brand visibility is critical to success in this new agentic web, and Adobe solves customer needs through solutions like Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Analytics, and the newly available Adobe LLM Optimizer. The pending acquisition of SEMRush, we announced a few weeks ago, brings complementary assets to help us address marketers' growing need for sustained brand relevance in AI search. Over the past decade, Sambrace's data-driven search engine optimization and generative engine optimization solutions have earned the trust of industry leaders like Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and TikTok. Together, Adobe and Semrush will deliver a solution to enable marketers to shape how their brands appear across own channels, LLMs, traditional search, and the wider web.
We anticipate the transaction to close in 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Adobe Brand Concierge, which was launched in Q4, is an AI-first application enabling businesses to configure and manage AI agents that guide consumers from exploration to purchase decisions using immersive and conversational experiences. By uniting data, content, and agentic AI in a single experience, BrandConcierge gives businesses ownership of the critical discovery and consideration phase. We are pleased with the significant customer interest and the wins we had for brand concierge in Q4. The third pillar of customer experience orchestration is the content supply chain. Chen Studio is our comprehensive offering spanning content ideation, creation, production, and activation.
At Max, we introduced new scaled production capabilities through Firefly services, enhanced model customization with Adobe Firefly Foundry, and integration with a growing ecosystem of ad networks. Ending ARR for the Adobe Gen Studio solution grew over 25% year over year as the world's leading brands increasingly turned to Adobe to power their content supply chain. FY '25, marketing professional accomplishments and business highlights include strong customer demand for our newly introduced agentic web offerings with over 50 customers in Q4 for Adobe LLM optimizer sites optimizer, and brand concierge. Growing international momentum resulting in a record quarter for our enterprise business in our Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and Asia regions.
Expanded ad network partnerships with Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Snap, and TikTok, Q4 industry analyst recognition, including being named a leader in the Forrester Wave for digital experience platforms, and three Gartner Magic Quadrants including multichannel marketing hubs, b to b marketing automation platforms, and digital asset management. And key global customer wins for the quarter include AstraZeneca, AT&T, Citigroup, Comcast, Costco, CVS Health, Ernst and Young, General Motors, IKEA, JPMorgan Chase, Lowe's, NatWest Group, PwC, Tony, Walgreens, Wells Fargo, and Woolworths Group. Customer experience orchestration continues to be a critical area of investment for companies of all sizes. We are helping brands across the world turn the promise of AI into tangible marketing ROI.
As a leader, we're well-positioned to grow our business and help our customers drive customer loyalty, revenue growth, and profitability. I'll now pass it to Dan.
Dan Durn:
Thanks, Anil. Today, I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q4 and FY 2025, highlighting growth drivers, and I'll finish with our targets. In FY 2025, Adobe delivered record revenue of $23.77 billion, growing 11% year over year as reported and in constant currency. GAAP EPS for the year was $16.7 and non-GAAP EPS was $20.94, growing 3514% year over year respectively. We delivered over $10 billion in operating cash flows while investing in AI product innovation. We executed record share repurchases totaling nearly $12 billion, reducing our shares outstanding by over 6% during the year, underscoring our confidence in the company's long-term opportunity.
FY 2025 business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $17.65 billion, growing 11% year over year as reported and in constant currency. Digital Experience segment revenue was $5.86 billion, growing 9% year over year as reported and in constant currency.

Digital media ending ARR was $19.2 billion, growing 11.5% year over year, exceeding our prior target of 11.3%. Over 75% of Digital Media net new ARR was driven by continued growth in subscriptions and cross-sell and upsell, with the remainder from value-based pricing reflecting the success of our customer acquisition strategy.
Total Adobe ending ARR across business professionals and consumers, and creative and marketing professionals of $25.2 billion, growing 11.5% year over year. Cash flows from operations of $10.03 billion and ending cash and short-term investment position of $6.6 billion. RPO of $22.52 billion exiting the year, growing 13% year over year or 12% in constant currency. And CRPO growing 11% as reported or 10% in constant currency. And repurchasing approximately 30.8 million shares of our stock during the year. We currently have $5.9 billion remaining of our $25 billion authorization granted in March 2024. In Q4, Adobe achieved revenue of $6.19 billion, growing 10% year over year as reported and in constant currency.
GAAP EPS in Q4 was $4.45 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.5, increasing 1714% year over year, respectively. Q4 business and financial highlights included Digital Media revenue of $4.62 billion, growing 11% year over year as reported and in constant currency. Digital Experience segment revenue was $1.52 billion, growing 9% year over year or 8% in constant currency. Digital Experience subscription revenue was $1.41 billion, growing 11% year over year as reported and in constant currency. Total new AI-influenced ARR now exceeds one-third of our overall book of business as we integrate AI deeply into our solutions and continue to launch new AI-first offerings, which are now included as part of the AI influence metric.
As we've shared over the past year, our strategy is to drive the entire book of business with AI-influenced solutions. Record net new digital media ARR, growth reaccelerated year over year, driven by strong demand for AI-influenced offerings including Creative Cloud Pro, Acrobat, and Express, as well as AI-first products, including Firefly. When combined with the strong net new digital experience ARR in Q4, we delivered record net new total Adobe ARR in the quarter. Record cash flows from operations of $3.16 billion, adding a record $2.08 billion to RPO in the quarter. For Business Professionals and Consumers Group, subscription revenue was $1.72 billion, increasing 15% year over year as reported or 14% in constant currency.
Q4 growth drivers for business professionals and consumers included double-digit ending ARR growth with strength across digital, SMB, and enterprise, and across all geographies. Mobile ending ARR grew greater than 30% year over year. Monthly active users of Acrobat and Express surpassed 750 million, growing 20% year over year. And strong customer reception of Acrobat Studio with nearly 50% of Acrobat commercial ETLAs renewed in Q4 already upgrading to this offering. For the creative and marketing professionals group, subscription revenue is $4.25 billion, increasing 11% year over year or 10% in constant currency.
Q4 growth drivers for creative and marketing professionals included growth in Creative Cloud driven by CC Pro, growth in single apps driven by strength in Photoshop, and Lightroom. Consumption of generative credits in Creative Cloud, Firefly, and Express increased three x quarter over quarter. Significant web and mobile user acquisition across Firefly, Express, Premier, and our other freemium offerings, growing over 35% year over year to greater than 70 million monthly active users. AEP and apps ending ARR grew over 30% year over year. Demand for content automation offerings like Firefly Services and Firefly with ending ARR more than doubling year over year. GenStudio solution ending ARR grew over 25% year over year.
And continued success in the enterprise, adding a record number of customers to the group with ARR exceeding $10 million. Total customers with ARR over $10 million grew 25% year over year to over 150. On November 19, we announced the intent to acquire Semrush Holdings for an equity value of approximately $1.9 billion in an all-cash transaction. We expect the transaction to close in 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect the non-GAAP EPS impact of the acquisition to be negligible in the first year post-close and accretive thereafter. Let me now turn to our financial targets, which assume current macroeconomic conditions. Our targets do not include any contribution from SEMRush.
As is customary, we revalued ending ARR at the end of FY 2025, which resulted in a $460 million increase to total Adobe ARR, from $25.2 billion to $25.66 billion entering FY 2026, primarily from FX rate changes. We've now provided historical information on total Adobe ARR going back to FY 2023 in our investor datasheet. For FY 2026, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $25.9 to $26.1 billion. Business professionals and consumer subscription revenue of $7.35 to $7.4 billion. Creative and marketing professional subscription revenue of $17.75 to $17.9 billion. Total Adobe ending ARR book of business growth of 10.2% year over year. GAAP EPS of $17.9 to $18.10. And non-GAAP EPS of $23.3 to $23.50.
This total Adobe ARR book of business growth of 10.2% translates to approximately $2.6 billion of growth, which would be our highest beginning of year guide for total net new ARR. This target is based on the strength exiting FY 2025, and continued momentum across all three audiences: business professionals and consumers, creators and creative professionals, and marketing professionals. Our FY 2026 targets anticipate non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45%, a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20.5%, and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18%. This non-GAAP tax rate is based on a three-year projection and may be adjusted for changes in the future.
For Q1 FY 2026, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of $6.25 to $6.3 billion, business professional and consumer subscription revenue of $1.74 to $1.76 billion. Creative and marketing professional subscription revenue of $4.3 to $4.33 billion. GAAP EPS of $4.55 to $4.6 and non-GAAP EPS of $5.85 to $5.9. For Q1, we expect non-GAAP operating margin approximately 47%, a GAAP tax rate of approximately 21.5%, and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18%. In summary, Adobe delivered another outstanding year fueled by strong global demand for our AI solutions across business professionals and consumers, and creative and marketing professional customer groups.
Our disciplined execution and strategic investments position us to extend our leadership as we deliver an ecosystem of AI models, conversational interfaces, and agentic experiences. Looking ahead to FY 2026, we're confident in our ability to deliver industry-leading innovation, double-digit ARR growth, and world-class profitability.
Shantanu Narayen:
Shantanu, back to you. Thanks, Dan. Our success is fueled by the incredible ingenuity of our global employees, who are passionate about delivering innovation, with relentless execution in service of our expanding customer base. Adobe is well-positioned to seize the immense market opportunities that we are creating, driving continued growth and shaping the industry in 2026 and beyond. Thank you, and we will now take your questions. Operator,
Operator:
Thank you. Phone, please make sure your mute function is turned off. Allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star one if you would like to ask questions. First question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Thank you very much, and congratulations on a great finish to the year. Shantanu, you know, down at Adobe MAX, the energy, the enthusiasm was just truly phenomenal. And it felt to us like a breakthrough moment. Talking to customers down there, there was just quite a bit of interest in Firefly Foundry specifically because the customers can end up with this private AI model and, you know, something that'll understand their identity and their style.
Can you speak to how customers are starting to use foundry in the early stages and perhaps just what type of economic potential that might be able to unleash for Adobe? Sure, Mark. And, thanks for, the comment. I'll start and then maybe David can add as well. And I did see in your report that you had you know, sort of the work that you've been doing behind the scenes to customer sentiment. So we appreciate that. You know, from our perspective, I we just look at it and for enterprises. The entire content supply chain Gen Studio, is really the offering that we wanna provide that takes care of every aspect of their content production.
Whether it's the creation part of the campaign, whether it's then creating custom models, whether it's training it at the back end, whether automating it, and then, you know, certainly delivery. And so Firefly services is off to a great start, continues, I think, the prepared remarks. David talked about, you know, the hundreds of deals that we're signing in that particular space. And foundry just takes it to a different level in terms of our ability to customize whether it's for a retailer, whether it's for media and entertainment, the ability to do a lot more. So, you know, we really view that as a massive opportunity.
In terms of whether it's a marketing team or the media and entertainment workflow, that allows them to create content, deliver that content, localize it. But maybe, David, you can add to, you know, some of the sort of customers and what we can do there as Yeah. As Shantanu talked about because we have this great position with GenStudio and the content supply chain, we've been hearing more and more from customers that in order to take it to the next level, they need more than what off the shelf models can provide.
And as a result, we introduced Foundry, like you mentioned, at Max on the core value is that we train on their content, their data, and their brand guidelines. We're able to generate images, videos, audio, and three d models. And we operate it as a managed service. So, marketing teams can then train on product shots, environment styles, brand guidelines, and media companies actually train on their individual franchises, whether it's a movie or whether it's a it's a series They'll train their characters, their sets, their props, their locations so they can generate the whole thing. I'll give you one example from a from a financials or economics perspective.
Let's take a mediacom media and entertainment company we're working on. And I'm rounding the numbers here, but to give you a little bit of a of context, let's say that organization was spending $10 million with us ARR on our core creative products that we've been, been selling with them. Know, we ran a, ran a sales process with them in and give engagement with them for about six months. We were able to sell them Firefly services Firefly Foundry for about $7 million, so pretty significant step up. In terms of, you know, the engagement that we have with the customer.
We're able to train models, within, two or three months and now we're running, some of those models specifically as managed services for them for ideation and production, processes. They're already seeing increased in, efficiency in content production. They're able to generate more production. Content, and they're now getting into opportunities that are revenue bearing opportunities, like increasing the types of content they produce for social shorts, and personalizing, more of it for fan engagement with the integration with our real-time CDP. And, of course, that's with just a few of their franchises, more opportunities to expand beyond that. So very excited. Maybe one last thing to just punctuate what David said.
So our you know, the vision clearly is that for every single brand, if you're a consumer company or for every single TV show or a movie, we can create a foundry specifically for that particular franchise, as David said, because the ability to you know, help with the automation of that content and production is massive. It sounds like an incredible unlock. Thank you very much for taking my questions.
Operator:
And the next question will come from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets.
Matt Swanson:
Great. Thank you guys so much for taking my question. I had a question, kind of, as we expand the product portfolio and the go-to-market motion of really mirroring up the Creative Cloud and the Experience Cloud. Could you just talk about maybe the ROI focus on kind of justifying the value creation of these new productivity enhancements. Right? We've seen through all your product demos how much more content can be created. So really being able to marry that up to results and really kinda why is it a good thing for the enterprise that they have all these new capabilities?
Well, if you take a step back, Matt, and you think about every single business, I mean, they are trillions of dollars that are spent in marketing. And, you know, our opportunity is to really say we can help you make sure that content is more personalized. I'll I'll have Anil also add after this. And deliver it. And the frank, the fact is that since we can deliver that through an ad network, and then we understand through our analytics where that is resulting in traffic, where that is resulting in conversion, where that's not.
The only company that can close the loop from the creation of a campaign, the execution of that campaign, as well as then, you know, actually looking at what that causes in terms of commerce. And so you know, I think our real value proposition in all of this is that as increasingly people are saying, hey. I wanna use AI to create more. We can not only optimize and accelerate the amount of content that they're producing, we're the only company that can then help them say, hey. This caused so much traffic. And I think, you know, we can speak more to that as well as it relates to what we are doing around search, LLM, and ROI.
Yeah. Exactly. Say, Santil. Depending on the industry, 10 to 20% of the total marketing budget is spent on content, on content creation and production. And exactly with the content supply chain, this is the solution we offer to GenStudio. One, we are helping them reduce content production creation or production cost. But equally importantly, we're helping them create the content much in a much more agile manner and create a lot more content. So most marketers are moving from traditional marketing channels to a lot of the new channels, like Shantanu was saying, digital channels, for paid media as well as their own, own media. And that requires a lot more agility in content production.
Therefore, the content supply chain solution that we offer helps them, get a lot more effectiveness out of their marketing and better ROI.
Operator:
And we'll take our next question from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.
Alex Zukin:
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ivan here on the line for Alex. Maybe one question on going back to SEMrush acquisition. Can you maybe talk a little bit about you know, what was the strategic rationale a little more color on that, and maybe how we should think about the synergies from the deal for next year. Thank you. Yeah. If you look at what's top of mind for marketers right now, when we think of customer experience orchestration, brand visibility is one of the key areas that's top of mind for marketers. How their brands appear, how they're positioned, especially in new channels like the LLMs, whether it's, you know, ChatGPT or Google or Perplexity.
That's top of mind for marketers. So one of the things that we do really well by bringing, Adobe and Semrush together, we'll be able to offer a comprehensive solution for marketers so that whether it is their own media, like their own websites and their mobile apps, whether it is earned media like these LLMs, or across search engines. They have one solution that helps them improve their brand visibility, and make sure that they understand what customers are searching for, what prospects are actually searching for or prompting for, they are in the right places in the right way with their brands.
And that we are the only ones that can offer a comprehensive solution be able to do that across their own channels, as well as all of these new channels like, LLMs, in addition to search engines. Maybe the one thing I'll say is to, you know, also based on, the previous that Matt had. When we think about our own spend and how we do this at Adobe as we are engaging with, you know, billions of customers, being able to provide an integrated way of spending money across search, across LLMs, and understanding what is the relative efficiency of that.
I think most companies would say when they're seeing their business move up into the right, it's now coming from a more diverse set of channels. And this just allows us, between the search engine and the generative engine, to provide this unified approach. So I think it's a very unique, and then we can provide analytics for folks. So I think combining both your questions, this is why the excitement around the creative and marketing and the combination of that is something that, you know, really gives us a lot of confidence.
Operator:
And moving on to our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss:
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And, congratulations on Assad. End of the year. Maybe a kind of longer-term focus question. You guys have been clear that the strategy is proliferation first and then kind of monetization. Going forward. When it comes to a lot of these technologies and a lot of the innovation that you're pushing into the base, And I think some of the metrics that we're seeing in Q4 are getting us a little bit excited that we're starting to see some of that ability. You guys talked about monthly active users up over 15%. So the user base is growing. You talked about three x growth. And, the usage of the models.
On a quarter on quarter basis. The usage is ramping up. When can we potentially see this sort of grow the totality or ex stabilize or accelerate the totality of growth? At Adobe. Meaning, another when we see a year where ARR growth is stable, right, on a year on year basis or actually improving, because I think that's what investors really wanna see to get more confident in the stock and start revisiting the stock and coming back to the shares? Yeah, Keith. I mean, from my perspective, Q4 was a really strong quarter. And frankly, starting to be this inflection in terms of as we see the leading indicators. What is happening across the leading indicators.
You know, which gives us a lot of confidence. And that's why, you know, when you look at the total Adobe ARR growth target, you know, which translates to approximately $2.6 billion. That's the highest beginning of the year guide for total net new ARR. But unpacking your question, you're absolutely right. I mean, when we think how we've innovated in AI and transformed the business, you know, to serve the massive customer audiences that we see, What we've done a really good job of is in the business pros and consumers, you're seeing the MAU increase. You've seen the fact that we've got this technology in front of a lot of people We've got usage.
You saw the metrics that, I think David provided there in terms of, you know, what's happening on the freemium usage of that. So that's the early indicator. On the Creative Pro, you know, what we have seen across all three parts of the business, which is what's happening in Creative Cloud, what's happening in Firefly as a new app, and, you know, to the earlier question, Firefly Foundry. The automation associated with that. So, you know, we look at all of the three you know, markets that we serve.
And, you know, I think in the data as well, you know, I'm sure you looked at the fact that when you look at what's happening on the creative business, you can see, given you have underlying visibility into the core creative subscription, that is now growing sequentially, you know, quarter over quarter. And that's coming. You know? Frankly, the record know, digital media ARR is coming as a result of all three of them.
So you know, I think we're pleased not just with the strong Q4, but underlying how we've actually changed the you know, sort of, underlying part of the business, to be whether it's on MAU, whether it's infusing AI, whether it's on high higher value, products, and combining all of that, frankly, for the enterprise, which we continue to think is a differentiated strategy for us, So, you know, we have to just keep executing, but I think Q4 was inflection in the early indicators, which we continue to track. Outstanding. That's, super exciting.
Operator:
And our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. This is Shelly calling on behalf of Mark. And thank you so much for taking my question. Congratulations on solid quarter. Total Adobe NAIR growth this year ended at 11.5%, and next year, you're guiding to ten point two Could you help us understand what is driving the difference between this year's growth and the guidance? Is it certain parts of the markets that you think might behave differently next year versus this year? Thank you. Well, first, I guess there's another call that's also going on.
So, you know, I but I you know, from our perspective, when we look at it, I think you have to look at it also in terms of the app absolute. And the target actually shows momentum across all of these audiences. And so if you think that we've been, you know, we accomplished approximately $2.6 billion, this actually starts our guide for fiscal 2026, at that level. So I think, you know, from our perspective, it's showing the momentum have. And to your second question, as we think about you know, the ARR across the business professionals and consumers, as well as the creative and marketing professionals.
This is predicated on our confidence associated with all customer groups as opposed to one of them. Again, to the question that Keith asked earlier, it reflects, the progress that we made on Xpress and Acrobat, whether it's with AI assistant, whether it's with PDF spaces, whether it's with infusing creativity into that offering, Firefly, and Creative Cloud, and Creative Pro, CC Pro offering, Firefly services. So, you know, across the board and AP and apps on a talked about AEP and apps. He talked about Gen Studio brand visibility.
As well as the acquisition of Semrush that will when that happens, you know, based on all the regulatory conditions that we need to fulfill, that also adds to our offering. So, you know, we're, we're pleased with our performance in Q4, and we're excited about the future.
Operator:
And we'll take a question from Jake Rubersch with William Blair. Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And good to see the partnership announced and integration with ChatGPT. David, as you expand to these new services outside of the Adobe ecosystem, how are you thinking about driving monetization of that usage, or converting those users over to your platform? Yeah. Our focus has always been around sort of meeting customers where they are. And, you know, that used to predominantly be focus on search and the web, and now we're seeing this incredible growth with, LLMs. And so we are, taking all of our technology and making sure that it can run-in these LLMs.
They represent, in our mind, a great top of funnel. They let us reach new users that we took wouldn't have reached with some of the traditional markets that we go through. And we can engage them in new ways. And it gives us an the journey work that's already in there. It gives us the opportunity to flow them into our full paid plan. So it's a it's a real top of funnel game with a conversion opportunity on the back end of that.
And of the maybe the more important, you know, elements and moments of why this is such a critical, moment for us is that as LLMs start embracing these model con context protocols, these MCP endpoints, it's no longer that these LLMs are about a prompt to a model and a response. It now gives us the opportunity to have the mod the LLMs actually work with models and APIs. And that plays to a really strong strength that we have in durable differentiator given the incredible APIs we have across creativity and productivity. So it lets us reach a lot more customers.
It lets us atomize the capabilities you know, double down on the freemium, experience that we put in been putting in place, as Keith mentioned. Our creative freemium MAU grew, over 35%, and this just continues to drive that. And we're starting to see the tail end of that turn into conversion and show up in our results.
Operator:
And our next question will come from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.
Michael Turrin:
Hey, thanks very much. Appreciate you taking the question. Mentioned credit consumption up 3x this quarter. I was just hoping to hear a bit more around what you're seeing from an overall consumption perspective, how third-party models are impacting that and if you're becoming at all more confident in monetizing or forecasting consumption? And then secondarily, from your perspective, there better or worse scenarios for us to be thinking about in terms of which of the larger models win mindshare in the market for Adobe just given I think you've seen a lot of differing opinions of that. Especially of late Thanks very much. Yeah. Happy to take that.
So just for the broad broader group on the call, if you take a step back, we introduced, generative credit few years ago when we introduced, generative AI into our products. And customers get credits in a couple different ways. First, you know, all of our plans now come with some base level of credit, access. And, of course, higher end plans include more credits. The second thing is that when customers deplete their credits, they can get more credits in one of two ways. They can upgrade to a higher end plan, and or they can purchase generative credit add on pack.
And as we think about the growth algorithm associated with this, it's really a multiplier across four different things. First of all, the number of apps that have these generative capabilities, times the number of media types that we support times the number of use cases and workflows that we've integrated these into, times the number of models that we have that we that people are able to use. And we had major updates for all of these, at Max earlier this earlier in Q4. From an apps perspective, we now have these generative capabilities into our Firefly app, our Creative Cloud, application including Photoshop, from your Lightroom, obviously, also in the Creative Cloud Pro offer that we have.
From a media types perspective, we've been doing a lot with images, video, audio design. We've seen a huge inflection in terms of video consumption in particular. So that's been a great sort of to the growth we're seeing. In terms of use cases, it's, you know, we've been focused on editing use cases. We've been expanding those editing use cases. We also introduced Firefly Boards, is around ideation that generates hundreds of images or videos or designs. And also bulk generation at the end of the, process for individuals that wanna do bulk actions on things. And then last, it's the models continue to get better with Firefly, and our partner models we're seeing higher resolution outputs.
We're seeing you know, higher density of and quality. All of those things also, increase the number of credits. That are that are getting consumed. And so in addition to all that, we announced a big amplifier to, to onboarding, which was we have a very attractively priced plan with our Firefly apps. It's really an all in one offer. You can get the world's best models from Adobe and third parties. And they're fully integrated into these amazing workflows at a at a very attractive onboarding price. So all of that led to the three x quarter over quarter growth in generation.
And as a result of that, as we as we touched on, we're starting to see increasing user upgrades to higher price plans and including credit pack add ons. So we're we're excited, and you saw that in some of the numbers. And, you know, our vision here is we'll work with all the great model providers of course, including the work we're doing internally. And we will increasingly, you know, be the single destination that everyone comes to access those models. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator:
And that question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.
Keith Bachman:
Yes. Thank you very much. David. I'd like to direct this to you if I could. And just ask you how you're thinking about the components or the construct of growth over the course of FY '26. And if I break it into two parts, just wondering if you could comment specifically on seats within the creator and marketing professionals not looking for specific numbers, but is seat growth remained steady within that category? It looks like you're filling top of the funnel across the board, but really what I'm asking about is paid seat growth.
Is would you anticipate that remains steady in FY '26 And then the second part of the question is if in the prepared remarks, digital media more broadly it was 75% It was up upselling price, and then the balance was basically price. And what I'm asking the spirit of the question is, despite growing competition, do you think pricing is still a lever that you can draw on to support growth in '26 and beyond? Many thanks. Yeah. Happy to take that. You know, a few things. One is I know we've spent an a number of time a number of couple years with all of you explaining the evolution of the product lineup.
You know, a few years ago, we used to have you know, for in the creative, ecosystem, we have to used to have Creative Cloud all apps and Creative Cloud single apps. And one of the most important things we've done over that period of time is to really look at where and how consumers or business professionals want to engage with creativity, and we found that it's very different. So when it comes to our lineup, we now have, you an increasing number of freemium offers. You know, with business professionals, with the, with the introduction of Express, but also the introduction of Acrobat Studio with which has is off to a great start.
We have, you know, a specific offer for creators with everything we're doing with the Firefly application. And, again, that's another freemium offer, but also has know, a nice sort of, tiered pricing associated with it. We have a strong, momentum with creative Pros, and those using the Creative Cloud applications. We've mentioned in the past, and we continue to see very strong migration over to the Creative Cloud Pro plan, the higher value plan that has, you know, more generative capabilities embedded in it. And we have, you know, at the very tail end of that process, we have the ability to do all of this automation work that we have.
Associated with Firefly services and Firefly Foundry integrated into GenStudio. So as we look at creativity and how it seeped into all of these different flows, we feel really good in the in the first two, as we said, with the freemium MAU 35 over 35% year over year, and our ability to start converting some of that MAO with the plans that we have in place now with both Express and Acrobat Studio and with everything we're doing with Firefly. And we're continuing to see strong usage, that three x growth we talked about.
You see a lot of creative professionals actually using that and starting to see more and more and more, you know, reliance and value from that in addition to what we're seeing in the enterprise. So, overall, we're seeing strong seat growth. We continue to believe that we have a lot of user acquisition ahead of us. We continue to see a lot of value to pricing opportunity with professionals, and I think there's a lot more ahead of us on that.
And as we mentioned in that case with media, the media company and enterprises at the highest end, we think that automation is gonna be a really good addition and sort of additional rocket engine to what we do. Thanks, David, and thank you all for joining us since that was the last question. What I wanted to again just summarize was not only was a q '4 a good strong, end to the year, I would say fiscal twenty five, we just continue to execute. And in particular, I'm pleased, with three aspects of, what we are focused on.
The first is certainly our customer groupings as we provide these tailored offerings for business professionals and consumers and creative and marketing professionals. How we've embraced AI and infused AI into all of those offerings, demonstrating that's the value that people look as they increasingly adopt our solutions. And, something that we probably, talked a little less about. But the execution that we have across all routes to market. And so whether that's what we are doing on digital, online in terms of engaging with our customers, what's happening both through the channel as well as our phone, in terms of selling to small and medium businesses.
And, certainly, at the higher end, the strategic partnerships and the relationships that we're creating at the enterprise across our combined offerings. So thank you for joining us. Happy holidays, and we look forward to continuing to execute against our strategy and sharing more with you in the future. Thank you.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
All right. Thanks so much, Mike. I'm really excited for the call today because there's two things that I've really been looking forward to talking about. First is our incredible financial transformation, as you can see from the numbers today.
And the second is the incredible work that's happening with artificial intelligence. Look, first of all, in Q1, we delivered 9.13 billion in revenue, up 11% year over year, in both nominal and constant currency. Subscription support revenue grew at 12% year over year and 13% in constant currency. And for the 11th year in a row, Salesforce is still ranked the No.
1 provider worldwide by market share based on the latest IDC software tracker. I mean, that really gets to a core part of our technology transformation that I'm going to get to, which is the transformation to AI. And because we are the No. 1 CRM provider, we're now managing more than 250 petabytes of data for our customers.
This is going to be absolutely critical as they move into artificial intelligence. And now, also, let's turn to our financial guidance. For fiscal year '25, we're maintaining our revenue guidance at 37.7 billion to 38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year over year. And we now expect fiscal year '25 subscription and support revenue growth to be approximately 10% year over year in constant currency.
As you can see from our results, we were remain committed to profitable growth at scale and, I would also say, incredible cash flow, and then continue to expect fiscal year '25 non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%, a 200 base-point improvement year over year. I'm extremely proud of our team's focus and determination to deliver this world-class financial result, including this cash flow and profitability in the quarter. And Brian and Amy will discuss Q1 performance in much greater detail. As I said, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity I had for Salesforce, not only with these incredible financial results but in the incredible transformations that we're leading with our customers in artificial intelligence.
Every company in the world across every industry is being transformed by AI in the next few years. And when you look at the power of AI, you realize the models and the UI are not the critical success factors. It's not critical where the enterprise will transform. There are thousands of these models, some open-source and some closed-source models, some built with billions, some with just a few dollars.
Most of these will not survive. They're just commodities now, and it's not where the intelligence lies. And they don't know anything about a company's customer relationships. Each day, hundreds of petabytes of data are created that AI models can use for training and generating output.
But the one thing that every enterprise needs to make AI work is their customer data, as well as the metadata that describes the data, which provides the attributes and context the AI models need to generate accurate, relevant output. And customer data and metadata are the new gold for these enterprises, and Salesforce now manages, as I mentioned, 250 petabytes of this precious material. We have one of the most and largest repositories of front-office enterprise data and metadata in the world. And every day, more companies are adopting Salesforce as their front office, bringing all their structured and unstructured data into our platform.
Nearly half of our top 50 wins in the quarter included six or more of our clouds. That really speaks to the comprehensive nature of our strategy. It's incredible. And many of these customers have essential business and customer data that exists outside of Salesforce that's trapped in thousands of apps and silos.
It's disconnected. That's why we're seeing this incredible mental with our data cloud, our fastest-growing, organic, and our next billion-dollar cloud. It's the first step to becoming an AI enterprise. Data cloud gives every company a single source of truth, and you can securely power AI insights and actions across the entire Customer 360.
Now, let me tell you why I'm excited about data cloud and why it's transforming our customers and how it's preparing them for this next generation of artificial intelligence. Data cloud was included in 25% of our million-dollar-plus deals in the quarter. We added more than a thousand data cloud customers for the second quarter in a row. Eight trillion records were ingested into data cloud in the quarter, up 42% year over year.
And we processed 2 quadrillion records. That's a 217% increase compared to last year. Over 1 trillion activations drove customer engagement, which is a 33% increase year over year. This incredible growth of data in our system and the level of transactions that we're able to deliver, not just in the core system, but especially in data cloud, is preparing our customers for this next generation of AI.
And last, month we created a Zero Copy Partner Network with partners, including Amazon, Databricks, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Snowflake so customers can access this live data from anywhere in data cloud without copying or moving it. It's the engine of our future growth, and this is the engine of our future artificial intelligence growth as well. As you know, for years, we've delivered predictive AI across all our clouds with Einstein. Einstein is generating hundreds of billions of predictions per day, trillions per week.
Now, we're working with thousands of customers to power generative AI use cases with our Einstein Copilot, our prompt builder, our Einstein Studio, all of which went live in the first quarter. And we've closed hundreds of copilot deals since this incredible technology has gone GA. And in just the last few months, we're seeing Einstein Copilot develop higher levels of capability. We are absolutely delighted and cannot be more excited about the success that we're seeing with our customers with this great new capability.
Saks, a leader in the luxury fashion market, part of Hudson Bay, went all in on Salesforce in the quarter. CEO Marc Metrick is using AI to create more personal experiences for every customer touchpoint across their company. And with our Einstein 1 platform and data cloud, Saks can unify and activate all its customer data that power trusted AI. Another great story is FedEx, a company that we all know bringing together previously siloed information.
It's the leader in getting packages delivered quickly. And, of course, how are we going to now deliver a more productive, more efficient, and more profitable FedEx? The Salesforce data and app and AI capabilities generate expense savings. This is the core efficiency while growing and accelerating top-line revenue. This is the effectiveness that we're delivering for FedEx.
This efficiency includes next-best action for sellers, automated lead nurturing, Slack for workflow management, opportunity scoring, a virtual assistant, AI on structured data for delivering content to sales and customer service. And when we think about effectiveness, we see our journey builder delivering hyper personalization, integrating customer experiences across service, sales, marketing, the ability to tailor and deliver customer experiences based on a Customer 360 view. When we look at this incredible next generation of capability we've delivered at FedEx, gone now are these days of static business rules that leave customers dissatisfied, asking, you know, ""Do they not know that I'm a valued customer of FedEx?"" Now, FedEx has not only the power of the Customer 360 but the power of AI to unlock so much more commercial potential by conducting an orchestra of commercial functions that never played well together before. You have a significant opportunity now with Salesforce and this incredible platform that sellers can convince companies to transform all of their incredible capabilities to deliver another level of profitability.
I think stories like that are driving our company forward, and it's all driven by the power of artificial intelligence. Another story I'm really excited about in the quarter is Air India transformed with data and AI. If you don't know about Air India, they're an incredible airline who's required multiple airlines to create this amazing platform for India's growth. And with data cloud, Air India is unifying data cloud across loyalty, reservations, flight systems, and data warehouses.
They have a single source of truth to handle more than 550,000 service cases each month. And now, with Einstein, we're automatically classifying and summarizing cases and sending that to the right agent with recommended next steps and upgrading in high-value passenger experiences. Even when things happen, like a flight delay, our system is able to immediately intervene and provide the right capability to the right customer at the right time. All of that frees up agents to deliver more personal service and create more personal relationships, a more profitable, a more productive, a more efficient, Air India, a company that's using AI to completely transform their capability.
Well, we're looking forward to talk to you more in this call about these incredible transformations, the financial transformation that we've gone through with these incredible cashflow and margin numbers, and this incredible artificial intelligence transformation. And now, over to Brian.

President, Chief Operating Officer
Hey, thanks, Marc. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. I also want to thank the team for their hard work this quarter. As Marc said, we're incredibly well-positioned for this AI transformation.
We're the No. 1 AI CRM, innovating at a pace I've not seen in my entire career. I could not be more excited about the opportunity ahead. We're seeing good demand as AI technology rapidly evolves and customers recognize the value of transforming into AI enterprises.
CEOs and CIOs are excited about the opportunity with data and AI and how it can impact their front office operations. We continue to focus on our growth levers of multi-cloud deals, international expansion, industry solutions, the Salesforce ecosystem, and, of course, the data and AI innovations across all of our clouds. Now, let me briefly address the buying environment. We continue to see the measured buying behavior similar to what we experienced over the past two years and with the exception of Q4 where we saw stronger bookings, the momentum we saw on Q4 moderated in Q1.
And we saw elongated deal cycles, deal compression, and high levels of budget scrutiny. In addition, in Q1, as part of our ongoing transformation, we made some intentional changes in our go-to-market organization to drive long-term productivity and create better customer experiences, which also played a role in the software bookings performance. At the same time, we are seeing strong momentum in various parts of our business, particularly data cloud and industries. And we continue to drive our core growth levers.
Multi-cloud deals, again, were a highlight for us in the quarter with six of our top 10 deals, including six or more clouds, showing the depth and relevance of our portfolio. Let me give you just one example of a company that is using Salesforce across the entire front office. CrowdStrike, a leading cybersecurity company and a longtime customer Salesforce added data cloud, marketing cloud, commerce cloud, revenue cloud, and MuleSoft in the quarter. CrowdStrike already relied on Einstein 1 sales and service and Slack, and now, they'll use data cloud to pull together new and trapped data from data lakes to build a 360-degree view of their customers, helping them align sales and marketing efforts to drive growth.
They're also leveraging MuleSoft with incredible results. MuleSoft has helped CrowdStrike accelerate project delivery by 30% and decrease maintenance costs by 20%. Salesforce is now the backbone of CrowdStrike, driving every aspect of CrowdStrike's operation and limiting their reliance on complex, siloed third-party applications. As Marc said, we're seeing impressive growth in our data cloud business.
In the quarter, 25% of our deals, over $1 million, included data cloud. It's obviously an important growth lever for us as it brings all of our clouds to life and makes them all better. And we continue to see momentum in Einstein AI with wins at Turtle Bay Resort, Autodesk, and Langley Federal Credit Union as companies transform into AI enterprises. One example is Siemens.
Siemens lacked a centralized destination for customers to easily choose the right products and buy on demand. To simplify the buying experience for customers, Siemens worked with Salesforce to develop and launch its accelerator marketplace, an AI-powered digital marketplace built on Einstein 1 commerce, providing AI-generated product pages, smart recommendations, and self-service ordering. And they did it all in just six months. And obviously, AI is not just for our customers, it's part of our own transformation.
We continue to adopt AI inside Salesforce. Under the leadership of our chief people officer, Nathalie Scardino; and our chief information officer, Juan Perez, we've integrated Einstein right into Slack, helping our employees schedule, plan, and summarize meetings and answer employee questions. Einstein has already answered nearly 370,000 employee queries in a single quarter. In our engineering organization, our developers now save more than 20,000 hours of coding each month through the use of our AI tools.
These innovations are helping us drive continued efficiencies across the business and accelerate our product roadmaps. We have great momentum with Slack, which, again, was included in nearly half of our top 50 deals in the quarter. We also launched Slack AI in February, an amazing innovation that provides recap, summaries, and personalized search right within Slack. I've personally been using it every day to get caught up on the conversations happening in every channel.
And we've seen great traction with our customers with this product. Our customers have summarized over 28 million Slack messages since its launch in February. Rocket Mortgage added Slack AI in the quarter to help its employees save time and close loans faster. They've also leveraged external Slack channels to collaborate with partners more effectively and efficiently.
And they've experienced a 60% faster turnaround speed from working with their customers and partners in Slack. On the international front, we had a solid quarter. In Latam, we had great wins at Cielo and Grupo DPSP; and EMEA, great wins at IHD Hotels and Resorts and John Lewis Partnership; and in APAC, Atlassian and Bank of Philippine Islands were wins in the quarter. We saw particular strength in our Japan business with wins at Seibu Prince Hotels Worldwide and Hitachi.
Industries was another growth lever for us in the quarter. Half of our top 10 deals included one of our industry clouds. A great example in the quarter was Paychex, a digital HR leader. By leveraging financial service cloud and data cloud, Paychex is able to unify their data to win better insights and creating a single view of each customer.
And using Einstein 1 sales and service, Paychex will be able to proactively manage insurance renewals, which means agents can proactively reach out and surface renewal opportunities during any touchpoint with the customer 30, 60, or 90 days in advance, driving an increased rate of renewals. And in the public sector, the city of Los Angeles chose Salesforce to modernize how the city's 4 million residents request city services using its MyLA311 system. The city will use government cloud and other Salesforce solutions to integrate AI assistance into MyLA311 and modernize its own constituent-facing services, giving residents more self-service options and improving service reliability and responsiveness. Our partner ecosystem always -- also continues to be a growth lever for us.
I'm especially excited about our deep partnership with Amazon as a growth driver for -- as we move forward into Q2 and beyond. With Salesforce products now available on the AWS marketplace, joint customers are able to expedite their deployments through faster buying and billing experiences and flexible budgeting options. In closing, I want to echo Marc in acknowledging the hard work of the team. Our continued success has been made possible by our amazing employees, customers, partners, and trailblazers.
And with that, I will now pass it off to Amy.

President, Chief Financial Officer
Great. Thanks, Brian. Q1 represents another quarter of continued discipline and transformation across the business. I am very proud of all of our employees for their continued dedication and hard work.
Now, let's go straight to the results. For the first quarter, revenue was 9.13 billion, up 11% year over year in nominal and constant currency. The result was at the lower end of our guided range due to continuing pressures on professional services, some license revenue volatility, and the continued measured buying environment. Subscription and support revenue grew 12% year over year in nominal and 13% in constant currency.
As mentioned on our last call, this included the tailwind from the timing of license revenue in MuleSoft and Tableau related to Q4 deals and a 1-point benefit from the leap year. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, Americas revenue grew 11%, EMEA grew 10% or 9% in constant currency, and APEC grew 14% or 21% in constant currency. We saw strong new business growth in Japan, India, and Canada, while the U.S., parts of Latam and EMEA were constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q1, public sector and financial services both performed well, while high tech and retail and consumer goods were more constrained.
Our new offerings for small and medium businesses, Starter and Pro Suite, which are ready-to-use simplified solutions with AI built in, are building momentum. In Q1, we added another 2,300 new logos to these products. Since Starter launched last year, we've seen customers upgrade to our recently launched Pro Suite and even to our Enterprise and Unlimited editions. Q1 revenue attrition ended the quarter at around 8%, in line with recent quarters.
I'm also very pleased that our non-GAAP operating margin again finished strong at 32.1%, up 450 basis points year over year. And our profitable growth trajectory continues to drive strong cash flow generation. Q1 operating cash flow was 6.25 billion, up 39% year over year. Q1 free cash flow was 6.1 billion, up 43% year over year.
Cash flow did benefit modestly from the timing of cash tax payments. Now, to put this cash flow performance in context, we have more than tripled the cash we generated just four years ago. Turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, we ended Q1 at 53.9 billion, up 15% year over year. Current remaining performance obligation, or CRPO, ended at 26.4 billion, up 10% year over year in nominal.
Now, this includes a $200 million FX headwind, which results in more than 10% year-over-year growth in constant currency. CRPO growth was primarily driven by resilience in our core products. However, as Brian mentioned, we did continue to experience measured buying behavior, which is reflected in the moderated Q1 bookings. On capital return, we were incredibly proud to pay out our first ever quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share for a total of 388 million.
And altogether in Q1, we returned more than 2.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This brings our total cash returned since the inception of our capital return programs to more than 14 billion. We remain committed to continue capital return and anticipate declaring our quarterly dividend next month, subject to board approval. Now, let's turn to guidance, starting with the full fiscal year '25.
A few items to note. First, on the buying environment, we're assuming that the conditions we saw in Q1 continue throughout our fiscal year. On FX, our revenue guidance continues to incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year over year, or about a 30 basis-point impact. We also continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to revenue with deal compression and customers delaying or slowing projects.
However, we also continue to see strong demand for data cloud and multi-cloud adoption, we're seeing benefits from recent pricing and packaging changes, and we're seeing strong industries adoption. These factors are also included in our guide. As a result, on revenue, we are maintaining our guidance range of between 37.7 billion to 38 billion, growth of 8% to 9% year over year. We now expect subscription and support revenue growth to be approximately 10% year over year in constant currency.
And we expect attrition to remain generally consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year. As a reminder, starting at fiscal '25, we include Slack invoice in the metric, which we expect to create a modest headwind. Now, turning to profitability and cashflow. On margins, we continue to expect fiscal year '25 non-GAAP operating margin of 32.5%, representing a 200 basis-point improvement year over year, following the significant increase last year.
This incorporates intentional investments and targeted growth opportunities, notably AI, data, and our core businesses. Stock-based compensation is now expected to be just above 8% as a percent of revenue. The modest increase from our prior guidance is primarily a result of lower voluntary employee attrition in Q1 than in recent years. As a result, for fiscal year '25, GAAP operating margin guidance is expected to be approximately 20%, representing 550 basis points of improvement year over year.
We expect fiscal year '25 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.04 to $6.12. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.86 to $9.94. As a result of our continued margin expansion, we are delivering world-class cash flow, and we continue to expect fiscal year '25 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 21% to 24%, inclusive of cash tax payment headlands. We also continue to expect capex for the fiscal year to be slightly below 2% of revenue.
This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 23% to 26% for the fiscal year. Now, to guidance for Q2. On revenue, we expect 9.2 billion to 9.25 billion, up 7% to 8% year over year in nominal and approximately 8% in constant currency. CRPO growth for Q2 is expected to be 9% year over year in nominal, including a $200 million FX headwind, resulting in 10% constant currency growth.
This includes ongoing headwinds from professional services. For Q2, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.31 to $1.33 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.34 to $2.36. In closing, I want to emphasize that I am incredibly proud of the company's commitment to disciplined strategic investments and continued productivity gains to drive strong margin expansion and cashflow growth at scale. And, of course, I want to thank our employees and our shareholders for their continued support.
Now, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.

Thanks, Amy, and thanks, everyone, for joining. While we go to Q&A, we ask that each participant to limit themselves to one question. And with that, Rob, we'll take the first question.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Keith Weiss

Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and I appreciate all the detail on sort of the growth drivers and what you guys are excited about in the business. But the quarter did come in below your expectations for CRPO growth. And we all look at that as a forward indicator, but you're not taking down the full year revenue guide.
And so I was hoping you could help us get comfortable on why that's not leaving risk on the table and why you guys feel comfortable that original fiscal year '25 guide is still appropriate. Why not take it down, make it more conservative, and ensure that we can get back to beat and raise quarters on a go-forward basis?
Amy Weaver

President, Chief Financial Officer
Great. Keith, thanks for the question. I'll take that one. Let me start by saying that there are many factors we have to consider within our guidance.
And all-in, based on what we're seeing at this time, we continue to believe that we will be within the range we guided. Now, any guide, you know, that is a balancing act. And as Brian called out, we are continuing to see this measured buying behavior. It's really been very consistent for the last two full years at this point, with the possible exception of Q4, where we did see stronger bookings.
And you can see the impact of that environment on our Q1 numbers. There's no question about that. Pro serve also continues to see more and more pressure as customers are really just looking for shorter duration projects. However, this is really balanced by the demand that we are seeing in our products, and that remains strong.
You know, we continue to see good demand on multi-cloud adoption. We're seeing benefits from pricing and packaging changes that we have rolled out over the past year. We're seeing a very healthy adoption around our industries projects. I also should point out that our attrition rates remain very healthy.
You know, customers are continuing to rely on Salesforce to run their businesses, and they'll continue to do that. So, when I step back and really take a holistic view of the full year, we do feel confident that we will be within our guided range.
Marc Benioff

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I'd like to add, I'd really continue to focus on, exactly like Amy says, this incredible transformation that we've seen with the financials. And obviously, you know, we're delivering some quarter -- some numbers this quarter that were beyond our imagination just a few quarters ago. But another point of optimism is not just what Amy said, but also, you know, we see this incredible transformation happening with our customers. And we all know the AI transformation is many transformations.
It's a transformation of how we're interacting with software. It's also a transformation of these algorithms, or we call these models, that the AI is built on. And it's a transformation of the data that's used by whether it's consumers or enterprises to deliver this incredible next level of intelligence. But for enterprises, we know that this customer data and this metadata is really the new gold for these enterprises, and it's a huge driver of growth for our business.
We all saw the report from McKinsey, 75% of the value of gen AI use cases is in the front office. And everybody knows, Salesforce is the leader in front-office software. That's our fundamental premise for our growth going forward, that we're already managing 250 petabytes of data and metadata that's going to be used to generate this incredible level of intelligence and artificial and capability to deliver for our customers a level of productivity and profitability they've just never been able to see before. And at the heart of that is going to be our data cloud.
And we've seen this data cloud -- well, we've seen this deliver for our customers an incredible level of capability in just the short period that we've made it available. It's already included in 25% of our million-dollar-plus deals, as I mentioned, and more than 1,000 data cloud customers in the second quarter. Again, that's our second quarter row. You know, when we look at a quarter where we see huge growth of a new product, it really sets us up, you know, for continued delivery of growth of that incredible technology.
But what's the cool thing about data cloud is it's connected to every single one of our clouds. So, it's making our sales cloud better, our service cloud better, our marketing cloud, our commerce cloud. Every aspect of Salesforce is better now with this incredible new technology. Another key part of it is, as I mentioned, 8 trillion records were ingested into data cloud in the first quarter.
That was up 42% year over year. And 2 quadrillion records were processed, that's up 217% year over year. And over a trillion activations driving customer engagement, up 33% year over year. All of that means that we're preparing our customers for a level of data capability that's going to give them this next capability of artificial intelligence.
And last month, we created the Zero Copy Partner Network with Amazon, Databricks, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Snowflake that federates our data cloud with all these amazing data sources. Look, we really are focused on two things in our company. One is this incredible financial transformation that we've all gone through with you in the last year. The second one is this incredible transformation to artificial intelligence, which is going to be based on data.
I don't think any company is more well-positioned for the future of artificial intelligence and also delivering the kind of metrics that our stakeholders are going to want in Salesforce.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Oh, great. Thank you so much. I appreciate the commentary on the impact from the tough macro. We're certainly seeing that across the group.
Brian, you mentioned also, perhaps, some impact here from go-to-market changes, which is, I guess, shouldn't be a big surprise given all that's going on at Salesforce right now. I wonder if you could just articulate a little bit on that. What are those changes? Is this the kind of situation where it's just some short-term impact that could benefit the sales productivity over the longer term? Thank you.
Brian Millham
--
President, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, Brad. Hey, thanks for the question. And you're exactly right. These are changes that we typically make in the first quarter.
It's the most obvious time to make those changes when you start out a new year. These changes are actually intended to be productivity drivers for the future. Absolutely right. We want to get a line behind our go-to-market strategy around buyer to make sure that we're aligned to support our customer scale, that we can really support our multi-cloud strategy going forward to ensure our customers know exactly what we can do to support them across our entire product portfolio.
And some of the changes that we made were exactly for that reason. How do we ensure that we are aligned behind that strategy to ensure we can go faster in Q2, Q3, and Q4? So, you're absolutely right. The changes, while impactful in Q1, are short term, and we expect to see productivity gains from them going forward.

Thanks. Just from a geographic perspective, Europe looked like it was a little weaker. I'm curious if that's where you saw pronounced weakness in EMEA. Or was this pretty consistent across most of the geographic regions? Thank you.
Brian Millham
--
President, Chief Operating Officer
Yes, EMEA was weaker in the quarter. You know, frankly, feeling some of the measured buying environment most pronouncedly. Actually, felt it also in the Americas. But there were other pockets around the world that were very strong.
You know, Canada was a strong region for us in the quarter. I mentioned our Japan business really accelerated in the quarter, really outstanding performance from our Japan business. So, the big businesses are going to feel the impact, obviously, of the measured buying environment. In the Americas, more exposure to technology, which I think we all know, has been a tough industry over the last several quarters.
Our SMB and other areas, the transactional business, these are the areas where you're going to feel some of those headwinds in the business. So, spot on, EMEA and Americas are sort of feeling the impacts of the measured environments.

Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Kirk Materne
--
Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah, thanks very much. Maybe for Marc or Brian. But I was just kind of curious, you know, when we think about this measured buying environment, is there any sort of crowding effect around AI that's impacting software in your view, meaning, you know, when you think about all these companies starting to gear up for this next platform shift? Or was it just the uncertainty of what they're going to spend on over the next six to 12 months, you know, holding them back, perhaps, on what their normal sort of pace of spending might be with you all or other enterprise software companies? I know it's sort of an ongoing question, wondering if you all could weigh in. Thanks.
Marc Benioff
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me give you my swing at exactly where we are. And then, I'm going to turn it over to Brian to fill in the detail. You know, I think when you look back over the last four years, you know, Salesforce entered the pandemic in 2020, it was four years ago, almost exactly, you know, about half the size that we're at now. We've doubled our company at scale, you know, to 20 -- from 20 billion to approximately 40 billion.
That's how I look at it in my mind. You know, you can fill in the exact numbers. And over that period of time, we saw an incredible surge in the demand and buying environment and in the sales environment, especially during the pandemic. As we entered the post-pandemic reality, we saw companies who had acquired so much software in that time look to actually rationalize it, ingest it, integrate it, install it, update it.
I mean, it's just a massive amount of software that was put in. And so, for every enterprise software company kind of had adjusted during into this post pandemic environment. So, when you look at all of these companies, especially as you saw them report in the last 30 days, they're all basically saying that same thing in different ways. When you take AI, that has to be your growth driver for future capabilities for these companies.
AI, when we look at these companies and the stories that we told, you know, on the call, whether it's FedEx or Air India or CrowdStrike or Paychex or any of the huge deals that we did in the quarter, you know, what we're seeing is not only the installation and integration and implementation of the platforms that we've sold in the last four years, but the layering in of this new capability, which is delivering for these companies, you know, a kind of a capability that we weren't able to forecast four years ago. When we saw, like I told you the story of FedEx, when we talked to their top executives about what they've delivered, or you take a credible company like State Farm, who's kind of automated 60 million policyholders, you know, and thousands of agents, they're just able to deliver, you know, at a level of capability. And I said it before, but profitability, employee augmentation, better customer relationships, much higher margins, these are financial metrics that we're able to deliver into these implementations. That's on top of where we were four years ago.
So, I think that as in the point I was trying to make here earlier, and I'll keep making, which is the most important thing Salesforce is doing is not just continuing to automate every customer touch point. This is obviously critical and why we've been able to consume this 250 petabytes of information. But the second key point is we've rebuilt the way that we are delivering a foundation of data for our customers. Why is that so important? Because as we have now rearchitected all of our apps and all of our capabilities to fuel and fund this data cloud, it means that for our customers going forward, they're going to be able to take this data cloud and leverage that into their future capability and growth and especially profitability and productivity.
And that is where our whole company, and I think our whole industry, is eventually going to go. Not every company is as well-positioned as you know for this artificial intelligence capability as Salesforce is because they just don't have the data. They may say they have this capability or that capability, this user interface, that model, that whatever, all of these things are quite fungible and are expiring quickly as the technology rapidly moves forward. But the piece that will not expire is the data.
The data is the permanent key aspect. It says we've said in our -- even in our core marketing, you know, it's the gold for our customers and their ability to deliver a next capability in their own enterprises. And, Brian, I'll turn it over to you.
Brian Millham
--
President, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, thanks, Marc. And I -- all those things, absolutely true. Marc said earlier, 75% of gen AI benefits will come from the front office, and we're really feeling that right now in our demand we're seeing from our customers and the pipelines that we're creating out there. You know, solid performance on pipe gen.
I do think customers are getting their data estate in order as a precursor to leveraging AI capabilities, and we're seeing that with the growth of data cloud right now. Customers really wanting to bring together many data sources so they can leverage AI in the flow of work and our capabilities. So, I think it's actually a step process for many of our customers, let's get our data in order and then let's layer in the AI to really drive the productivity gains that we expect. And so, that's really what we're seeing in the market right now, Kirk.

Karl Keirstead

UBS -- Analyst
OK, great. Maybe I'll switch subjects. Marc and Amy, there was some concern in your shareholder base in March and April around media reports related to M&A. I know you can't comment on those reports, not expecting that.
But wondering if you could comment on your M&A framework, whether there's been any change to it at all, I think, might be helpful. Thank you.
Marc Benioff
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, no, I'd love to talk about that. And I think it's extremely important. I mean, Salesforce has a long history of innovation, organic innovation, like we've seen today with data cloud. Everyone, I'm sure, is extremely impressed with the growth of that product, but also inorganic innovation.
And a lot of our customer touch points, whether it's our commerce platform or our marketing platform and our integration platform, are inorganic innovation. Products that we acquired, many of them at the multi-hundred-million-dollar revenue level that are at the multi-billion-dollar revenue level. Some of the largest, most important software companies in the market today are actually companies that we acquired at much smaller levels. And all of you know Salesforce's story and how we put all of that together.
And, of course, I've mentioned, we're rearchitecting almost every single one of those products and quite successfully redeploying them to our customers into a single integrated data fabric to provide the power of future artificial intelligence. Now, when we look at all of that combined, we always are looking at what is the next level of innovation. And so, we're going to be looking at products organically. But yes, we will continue to look at products inorganically.
But as we've committed to you, if we're looking at a large-scale acquisition, we're going to make sure that it is not dilutive to our customers, that it's accretive, you know, that it is -- you know, has the right metrics. And we're also going to be quick to walk away from things that we are not totally confident in or that we don't have the trust with whatever company that we're looking at. So, we have operated inside that framework. We continue to acquire companies.
We just acquired an amazing new company called Spiff, which is part of our Salesforce automation platform. It's an amazing capability. I mean, Salesforce, as you know, is the No. 1 SFA platform in the world.
That SFA platform got a lot better this quarter with the capabilities now that it's deeply integrated into data cloud, which gives SFA customers the next step of growth with our SFA platform. But also, it has an incredible new level of artificial intelligence and generative AI capabilities now built into the sales cloud. And in addition, it also has compensation capabilities through Spiff, and that's through Inorganic. And that was acquired through our new M&A framework, for example.
And as we go forward, we're going to continue to look at those opportunities. And look, we're not going to shy away from M&A for any one particular reason, if it's within our framework. But if it's outside of our framework, we're going to be extremely cautious. And let me have Amy reiterate what the attributes of that framework are and how we look at M&A because I don't think any company has been more successful with M&A than Salesforce has been.
I mean, that's how we built our Customer 360 and have this incredible platform that we're able to automate these amazing companies with what we've gone through. But as we go forward, we know that we need to slightly adjust that so that we can continue to deliver to you these amazing financial metrics that you see, like you see this amazing cash flow number and margin number that we've seen rarely before in the software industry. You know, maybe only a couple companies have ever delivered cash flow at this level, and I think it's higher than most of the great consumer companies like Coke and Starbucks and all of that. Like it's pretty -- these numbers are pretty epic in that area.
But we know to deliver -- continue to deliver cash flow and margin numbers at this level, we're also going to have to continue to keep our eye on the M&A framework. So, Amy, let's talk about that.
Amy Weaver
--
President, Chief Financial Officer
Great. Thanks, Marc. Let me back it up a little bit to talk about our capital allocation strategy overall. And it's really very simple.
We are going to continue to expand our free cash flow margin as we scale. We are going to invest in innovation. As Marc said, that is organic and it can be inorganic and if it matches our principles and our goals. And we're going to return cash to shareholders.
And we're doing that now both through our share repurchase program and our dividends program. Now, on the inorganic perspective, as you brought up, we're always going to be opportunistic. You know, M&A has been an incredible part of our past. I'm sure at the right time, it will be part of our future.
But it's got to fit into the framework that we have been outlining for the last few days. We're going to have to have a clear timeline to value accretion. We're going to need to prioritize our use of the balance sheet. And it's got to be a best-in-class asset.
And when all that comes together, that's what we'll be focused on. In the meantime, you know, I really want to talk about our goal. We are trying to optimize shareholder value. At the end of the day, that's the single most important element.
And we're doing that by focusing on delivering very strong free cash flow per share. We're doing this by our focus on profitable growth and by very carefully managing our dilution. And when you bring that together, I am very confident in our long-term free cash flow per share opportunity and very confident about our capital allocation strategy overall.

Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.
Raimo Lenschow
--
Barclays -- Analyst
Thank you. Obviously, you know, this quarter was impacted on the booking side. The maybe question for Brian and Amy here, if you think about the two factors you pointed out, one is the economy, one is the sales changes at the beginning of the year, on the economy side, like, you know, we've been talking about a tough selling environment for a while now. Has it gotten worse from what you've seen? Or are the issues this quarter more coming from the sales reorg? Thank you.
Brian Millham
--
President, Chief Operating Officer
Raimo, thanks for the question. Appreciate it. Hard to parse apart what the two impacts were in our first quarter, no doubt about it. We did have some changes I outlined in the quarter as we set ourselves up for productivity in FY '25.
The economy question, I think, is one that we feel like it's similar to what we felt in the first half of last year. The same measured buying environments that we experienced in the first half is sort of what felt like the same in Q1. We came off a Q4 that was very solid. Very, very strong performance.
In retrospect, in hindsight, you know, we may have been in a similar environment but executed very well as a sales team in that fourth quarter. So, hard to really parse apart these things. But when you look at some of the transactions that we saw in Q1, we saw compression on many deals that we ultimately ended up getting done, but they got smaller when we ultimately closed them. We saw a couple deals push out of the quarter as people delayed decisions that were -- that we thought would actually happen in our first quarter.
And, you know, this no-decision issue is coming up more frequently than we anticipated. So, hard to really parse those two things apart, but when you combine them both in a particular quarter, it can have an impact of lower bookings. And that's what we felt in our first quarter.
Marc Benioff
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think I'd also like to add, and I'll just give you a little color on the narrative inside our company. When we look at operating inside this environment, which, you know, we've been now going through for a couple of years, and we look at, hey, how do we continue to deliver these strong, you know, ACV numbers, but also how do we continue to deliver the overall strong financial metrics at the same time? It's important that we're delivering this high level of customer success to prepare for our future growth. You know, it's really along three lines. And those three lines, first of all, is we're just having to start every quarter with much higher pipelines.
We look at these pipeline multiples as much higher than we've traditionally had to start with, and this is really critical in managing our distribution organization and overall success in the quarter and where, traditionally, we might have to start our pipelines at 2x. Now, our message to our distribution leaders is, hey, if you're going to start out your pipeline in the quarter, you better start out at 3x. And this is also our message to our peers as well to evaluate the pipeline much more aggressively than ever before. That means a much deeper inspection of the pipeline but holding it at a much higher level.
That is evidence of this environment. And if you would ask any leader in this company how many times they've heard from me or from Brian that they better start it at a 3X pipeline because that is the world that we're in today. The second attribute that's incredibly important for all of our leaders and, you know, in our company or throughout our industry is you might need a much higher level of enablement. What that means is so many people have come into our industry in the last five or even 10 years, you know, a lot of them just need the level of training capability, especially as we move into this new area of artificial intelligence, generative AI, data.
You know, the kind of capabilities that we're talking about when we explain to people how models work, how UIs work, how data frameworks work, and how it really works in regards to our software and our platforms and our architectures, that is requiring a level of training that is incredibly important. And when we're talking about companies at scale, like Salesforce, who have very significant numbers of salespeople -- I'm not going to go into all the details of how it's organized and how many we have. But just know that that requires a very high level of enablement. That's the second key attribute managing in this framework -- in this environment.
And the third is a level of stability. Now, when you enter the first quarter of any fiscal year, there always is going to be a desire of every sales organization to slightly shift, slightly adjust their strategy and their organization to reflect the demands of the fiscal year. You start the fiscal year writing your business plan, thinking about how you're going to execute. Then, you have to look at how much disruption are you able to tolerate in the quarter.
Because if you over shift, if you do too much, you will end up with more volatility in the quarter in the ACV than you like. Now, it may result in a better fourth quarter. A good example is last year, you know, where we saw, OK, in the first quarter, we might not have achieved exactly everything we wanted because we had too much disruption. But by the fourth quarter, we over-delivered.
So, there is a level of balance that has to be achieved in regards to stability and disruption. And those four attributes, having 3x pipelines, having much higher levels of enablement, and having much higher levels of stability, that is the key to managing in this environment and this part of the industry right now. And when I talk to my peers and other major enterprise software companies, that is what I'm really emphasizing to them. And for all of them, of course, it's good if they're using our products because our products are really the key to making all of that happen because we're able to deliver for these companies all of those things that they need to have that level of success as well.

Kash Rangan

Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thank you very much, Marc and team. I'm actually looking at the Salesforce tower from my office here, and I'm thinking about the past. Marc, you've been through all these cycles before. Maybe it's just cyclical, maybe high interest rates causing economic uncertainty, maybe it's as simple as that.
Or maybe it's structural. And if it's structural, maybe there's an architectural change going on. And, Marc, you drove the last big architectural change from distributed computing to internet computing. How confident you are that this generative AI, which is causing an upheaval in that whole tech stack, is not something to take lightly? And what are the things that the company is preparing if it's not just cyclical, if maybe there's structural change that's going on? What are the things that you are doing to the company to bulletproof -- because typically people -- incumbents miss big transitions, right? You and I have seen that, we've all seen that.
And what are the things you're doing to ensure that you're bulletproof in that regard, that you're absolutely ready architecturally for the next cycle?
Marc Benioff
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I will just say -- I'd like to make a couple of comments on that. You know, I think that, number one, it's been pretty magical to use OpenAI over the last year, especially in the last release, you know, where I'm really talking to it. And when I think about the incredible engineering effort that OpenAI has done, it's pretty awesome. They've built a great UI.
You know, I love talking to the software. They have really strong algorithms or what we call models, especially their new one, which is their 4o model. And then, you know, they stole data from lots of companies like Time, Dow Jones, New York Times, Reddit. Now, they're all making good, you know, doing agreements with all of us saying we're sorry and paying for it.
And they took that data, they normalized it. They delivered a comprehensive data set that then they train their model on. And all of us understand that that's what they did, right? They have a great UI, they have this amazing model, and then they have the data. And then, we've seen a lot of fast followers with the models.
You know, it could be open-source models like Llama 3. It could be some proprietary models like Gemini from Google and others. Now, there's thousands and thousands of these models. And if you look on Hugging Face, you know, everybody's a fast follower.
And six months later, everybody is where everybody else was six months ago. And the data, well, a lot of these companies are all thinking they can rip off all this data, too, and they're all having to pay that price. OK, that's the consumer world. The enterprise world's a little different, right? We have great user interfaces, great apps, all kinds of great technology that our users are using, the millions and millions of users.
Then we have, you know, the same models in many cases, or maybe we've written some of our own models with our engineers. But then the third piece is the data. And that data is a little bit different. Because in the enterprise, how do you put together these large, fully normalized data sets to deliver this incredible capability? And that is where the magic is going to be.
Because for all companies, including ours, others who want to deploy generative AI internally, it's not just going to be Time Magazine that's going to give you the intelligence. It's going to be your customer data and your transaction history and how your company operates in your workflow and your metadata. And that idea that we can deliver another level of productivity for companies using that architecture is absolutely in front of us. But that idea that we have to do it, you know, with the right architecture, that also is in front of us.
And I think that while we can say it's a different kind of architecture, it's still the same idea that we need a great UI, we need models, but we're going to need very highly normalized and federated data. And that data needs to be stored somewhere, and it needs to come from somewhere. And that is going to be something that's going to continue in perpetuity over time as these models and UIs, you know, are quite fungible. And, you know, we'll be using different models and different UIs over the years, but we'll be using the same deep data sources.
And I think that is why, when I look at what Salesforce is doing, this is going to be critical for our customers. Now, you may see great new UIs like agents, and you may see great new UIs like you see what we've deployed with Slack. You know, Brian was talking about how he's changed how he uses Slack with our new Slack AI, or what we've done with SFA this quarter, service this quarter, with the incredible new generative capabilities. But this idea that the data, you know, is going to be more important for companies than ever, having deeply normalized federated data sources, and when I look at the success we've had with so many of these companies, I mentioned State Farm briefly, you know, we've become their fundamental data architecture.
That is not where we were with that company even four years ago. Now, they look at us as the fundamental framework for their future. And as they want to deploy agents or as they want to deploy new user interfaces or achieve more productivity; the data that they have in Salesforce and the ability to manage and share, keep that data reliable, available, and scalable; the way that we do updates that we don't bring down our system, you know, do an upgrade or update like a lot of vendors still do, you know, those kind of capabilities, that will be more important than ever. And I think that that is going to what -- be a huge driver for our growth going forward and provide the foundation for this future and what the future of the enterprise is going to look like.
And I think it's a little bit different than in the consumer model.

Your final question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mark Murphy
--
JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Marc, you mentioned that there's a transformation of how we interact with software that's happening. And I'm curious, if you sense any temporary pause as customers may be trying to digest the new innovations, the new pricing mechanisms, it includes consumption pricing, and that, perhaps, there's going to be a pause that refreshes down the road as they will ultimately gain comfort and start to move forward with the Einstein Copilots and all the other innovations that require, you know, a little bit of a different architecture, a different thought process.
Marc Benioff
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think it's a very key question, which is, you know, Salesforce is managing many different kinds of pricing models. Obviously, like our data cloud, it's a consumption product. We've seen, you know, a clear path now at over a billion in revenue with that product that uses consumption pricing. You know, we look at our core SFA product, which is a product doing, I don't know, approximately $8 billion a year, or service cloud doing approximately $8 billion a year.
These are per-user prices. But when you buy Salesforce now and you're buying our products, you know, you might be buying a new product that we have called UE+. And that's a product that we just introduced a few months ago. Now, why is that exciting? Because UE+ is a hybrid pricing model that includes per-user pricing and consumption pricing.
It delivers for our customers the ability to deploy all the architectures that I articulated on the call today but to do it at an incredibly competitive price point. And when we look at the very large customers that are deploying Salesforce, standardizing, you know, on our platform to deliver this kind of capability for the future, as we retrain our salespeople to be able to have the commit -- the narrative that I have on the call today, you know, this idea that we can deliver basically not only the No. 1 AI CRM, not only deliver, you know, we see these incredible growth in our pipelines, as I mentioned, not only the kind of the next-generation, you know, price points and products like with UE+, but we have to deliver it with a level of customer success for our partners and the implementations at scale and also, you know, with the culture that Salesforce is known for. Those are really the five elements that we are really taking into consideration as we're moving forward.
We think that we have the right mix, and, you know, we're spending a lot of time talking to our customers very, very closely. Look, don't think that there aren't a lot of, you know, people walking into these companies saying, ""Hey, you can do this, you can do that, you can do these other things."" We've seen a lot of that in the last, you know, six to 12 months, and then it turns out that you can't. ""Hey, I can make this happen, I can make that happen, I can pull a rabbit out of the hat in the enterprise for you by doing this, that, and the other thing,"" and then it doesn't actually happen. And then, what it turns out is you got to do a lot of the hard work to make this AI happen.
That starts with building highly normalized, large-scale, federated, you know, highly available data sources, and then, building on top of that the kind of capabilities to deliver it to our customers. I think a common story is, ""Hey, oh yeah, I am a provider of a data lake or a data capability. And just by going to that, I'm going to be able to provide all your AI."" But then, it turns out that no one in the enterprise actually uses that product. There is no UI that's commonly accessed.
That's why I'm so excited that Salesforce's sales cloud and service cloud and Tableau and Slack and all of our amazing products that have, you know, huge numbers of users that use these products every single day in a trusted, scalable way and then connecting that in to this new capability. That's where the magic is going to happen. By the time we get to Dreamforce, and for those of you maybe who are at our Connections conference or our last world tour in New York or even TrailheaDX, you know, we haven't heard gasps in the audience when we demoed the products in a long -- you know, I think maybe ever. Like some of the new technology is incredible.
We're able to deliver for our customers. And I think that it's going to be extremely exciting going forward. And it will be delivered with a variety of new business models and pricing models. But at the end of the day, we're going to have to be, you know, a trusted partner to these customers delivering this AI at scale.

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
All right. Thanks so much, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call. We've got so many exciting things to talk about today, and we're so excited to be with you, and we're also getting really jacked for Dreamforce, so looking forward to that. And we are just going to have a great call here.
So, look, a year ago on this call, we talked about two amazing transformations. So, we're transforming Salesforce for as we're talking about the short and the long term, which was really code words for really addressing our financials, but really looking at this incredible AI opportunity. And now we look at a year later, I just couldn't be more excited about how these two transformations are driving the success of the company. And really, I don't think I've been more excited about the history of Salesforce and now the future of Salesforce and how well-positioned we are for the future.
And you can see it in our numbers with strong performance across revenue, cash flow, margin on CRPO. The numbers are beyond my expectation in the quarter. You can see that it's been pretty awesome. And you can also see them, the incredible innovation of our product and engineering teams are delivering the success of our customers.
And we're going to talk about a whole different kind of sales force today, a different kind of architecture and a product that we didn't even talk about on the last earnings call that is going to be fundamental to our future and a manifestation of our decade of AI leadership, which is Agentforce. Now, in just a few weeks, we're going to kick off Dreamforce, and I hope all of you are planning to be there, the largest AI event in the world with more than 45,000 trailblazers in San Francisco. And this year, Dreamforce is really becoming Agentforce. And I'll tell you it's a funny thing about Agentforce even one of our very top executives in engineering sent me a text last week and said, ""Hey, should we be renaming the company from Salesforce to Agentforce because we're all getting so excited about Agentforce."" And I also told Mike that I really want to make sure all of you are there and to do what he can to put together an analyst briefing at Dreamforce, and I told him I pay for to have outstanding culinary shafts and maybe we can bring in some great entertainment for all of you to encourage you all to come.
So, I just gave him a huge budget to really motivate everyone, because I think this is going to be a moment that everyone is going to have to see in person to understand what is going on. And I'm going to explain that in a second because we're going to show our new Agentforce agents and how we've reimagined enterprise software for this new world of autonomous AI. And every customer, I'm going to try to get every customer who comes to Dreamforce to turn agents on while they're there. So, many of the customers, of course, are already using our applications.
You know that, OK? And of course, we're automating all our customer touch points. That's our Customer 360. And we've been talking now for the last couple of years about how we've really built this phenomenal Data Cloud that has really become, I would say, our fastest-growing, most exciting product ever up until one that we're better to talk about, which is to help our customers amalgamate all the data that they need to really get their AI act and orders that gets their data and metadata integrated and then federate to other data sources. And then this critical third tier, which -- this is the first call that we've ever talked about it, which is these agents.
And this idea that you're not just going to have sales agents and service agents who probably read, heard maybe you saw in CBC, we're building the agents for Workday and we're going to be building custom agents for so many of you as well with Agentforce because it is a development platform as well as this incredible capability to radically extend your sales and service organizations. So, when you arrive at the Dreamforce campus, you're going to see a big sign outside that says, humans with agents drive customer success together. And that's because we now so strongly believe the future isn't about having a sales force or a service force or a marketing force or a commerce force or an analytics force. The future is about also having an Agentforce.
And while many customers today don't yet have agent forces but they do have sales forces or service forces, I assure you that within a year, we're all going to have agent forces, and we're going to have them at scale. And it's going to radically extend our companies and it's going to augment our employees, make us more productive. It's going to turn us into these incredible margin and revenue machines. It's going to be pretty awesome.
And this is really the future, a new future that we can really envision, and with this Agentforce platform, we're making it easy to build these powerful autonomous agents for sales for service from marketing for commerce, automating the entire workflow on their own, embedding agents in the flow of work and getting our customers to the agent future first. And this is our primary goal of our company right now. This is my singular focus. So, at Dreamforce and on this call, you're going to hear a lot of stories already of customers, and we're going to talk about the customers who have it, customers like OpenTable and Wiley and ADP and RBC and so many others who are deploying these agents and running them on top of our Data Cloud and our apps.
And in fact, you're going to hear about -- I mean, at Dreamforce, you're going to hear one of the very largest healthcare companies in the world. It's got 20 million consumers here in the United States who is resolving more than 90% of all patient inquiries with Agentforce and they're benchmarking us significantly higher than any other competing AI platform, and that's based on some incredible AI breakthroughs that we have had at Salesforce. And I just have to call out the quality of our research team, our engineering team, and our product team because the accuracy of our results, the reduction of hallucinations, and the level of capability of AI is unlike anything I think that any of us have ever seen, and we've got some incredible new techniques, especially incredible new augmented RAG techniques that are delivering us the capability to deliver this accuracy with our -- for our customers. In fact, one of these very large media companies that we work with, a lot of probably know who have everything, every possible media asset, while they're just resolving 90% of all of their employee and consumer issues with Agentforce, pretty awesome.
So, there's nothing more transformational than agents on the technology horizon that I can see, and Salesforce is going to be the first company at scale to deploy enterprise agents and not just any enterprise agents, the highest quality, most accurate agents in the world. Now, all of this with our continued focus on trust with customer success with innovation is driving the results that you see today. And in Q2, we've delivered $9.33 billion in revenue, up 8% year over year in nominal and 9% in constant currency. Subscription and support revenue grew at 9% year over year and 10% in constant currency.
And for the 11th year in a row, Salesforce ranked No. 1 CRM provider by the IDC Software Track. And of course, Salesforce is the No. 1 AI CRM, and we'd like to say we're the third largest enterprise software company, but I was doing some calculations today, and I'd like you guys to do the calculations.
I think we just became the second-largest enterprise software company because we're not delivering infrastructure or hardware, and we already passed Oracle in Japan as the second-largest enterprise software company, and I think we just did that. If you look at our enterprise software overall, we're the largest enterprise software company in the world. So, we continue to see growth in multi-cloud deals. In fact, multi-cloud deals accounted for close to 80% of our new business in the quarter, and we're just operating at this incredible scale, delivering 25 trillion Einstein transactions across all of the clouds during the quarter, that's 25 trillion and more than 1 trillion workflows are now managing 250 petabytes of data for our customers.
We also continue to deliver on this incredible margin growth and so many of you have guided us through that incredible transformation. So, I just want to thank all of you for that. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.7%. That's up 210 basis points year over year.
And you can see the incredible transformation that we've gone through over the last 24 months in margin and cash flow, which also was $892 million in the quarter, up 10% year over year. So, now, let's turn to this financial guidance. For the fiscal year '25, we continue to expect revenue at $37.7 billion to $38 billion, a growth of 8% to 9% year over year, and subscription and support revenue growth of approximately 10% year over year in constant currency. And as you can see from our results, we've remained committed to this very profitable growth at this incredible level of scale, and we're raising our fiscal '25 non-GAAP operating margin to 32.8%, a 230-basis-point improvement year over year.
And as I told you last quarter, we're delivering incredible record cash flow this year, and I'm pleased that we're also raising our operating cash flow guidance to 23% to 25% year over year. I'm also extremely proud of our team's focus and determination deliveries, great results, and we're going to hear more in a second. Now, as you know, and as you probably can tell from my narrative already, AI is not only my top-of-mind, but I can tell you, because I've met with hundreds of customers this quarter that it is the top of mind for every customer, for every CEO, for every CIO, but I want to tell you before I get into this, is that I think that there's a lot of misconceptions about AI with my customers. I have been out there very disappointed with the huge amount of money that so many of these customers have wasted on AI.
They are trying to DIY their AI. It's not selling like when we first saw cloud emerge or even some other technologies where they feel like they have to roll their own, build it themselves, get in the weeds, try to figure out and they're not going to do it better than we're going to do it. We're a professional enterprise software company, this is what we do, and we do it with the trust and scale that they need. And this idea that our customers are going to have to build their own models, train their own models, retrain their own models, retrain them again and I'm meeting with these customers, and they're so excited when they and they say, ""Oh, I built this model, and we're resolving 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% of this or that and whatever."" And I'm like, really, we'll take a look at our models and our capability where you don't have to train or retrain anything and you're going to get more than 90%.
And then they say, wait a minute, how do you do that? And this is a moment where every customer needs to realize you don't need the DIY your AI. You can use a platform like Salesforce to get the highest efficacy of artificial intelligence, the best capability to fully automate your company, achieve all of your goals and you can do it with professional enterprise software. And I've now met with all so many of these customers to really explain and to help them understand the transformative power of AI. And they've really -- I think we've all said, OK, we've never seen a technology evolve at such a rapid pace.
So, look at the last 18 months, we're moving from having these basic preprogram chatbots. Now, we can really see we're delivering these intelligent conversational capabilities, these agents, it's awesome. And we've created out-of-the-box platform to deliver all of this for them. So, this could be service reply recommendations, account summaries, report generation, you've seen in Slack, this kind of auto summarization, recaps, all of these amazing things, the level of automation, the amount of code that our team has written, the transformation of our platform in the last 18 months, it's remarkable.
And customers love it because they can take the platform and then all of this generative AI use case, customize it for their own needs or configure it using our capability because they're doing that without writing a line of code. It's clicks, not code, deploy them in days, not weeks. They're doing this in months, not years, and you're getting immediate ROI. And the stories are awesome.
And while customers have loved seeing the power of generative AI, even like I was using generative AI last night to write some new ads for what we're going to do to kind of bring Agentforce across. And it's so cool and so awesome, but to have it right inside the platform makes it very real for our customers. who have to manage and share all of their information to keep it trusted, to keep it secure, to be able to provide capabilities in a regulatory environment. Look, this is -- they all want this huge breakthrough that's going to give them much more productivity, augmentation of their employees, and scale like I've been talking about.
But we're seeing that breakthrough occur because, with our new Agentforce platform, we're going to make a quantum leap for in AI, and that's why it wants you all at Dreamforce because I want you to have your hands on this technology to really understand this. This is not copilots. So, many customers are so disappointed in what they bought from Microsoft Copilots because they're not getting the accuracy and the response that they want. Microsoft has disappointed so many customers with AI.
Listen, these agents are autonomous. They're able to act with accuracy. They're able to come right out of the box. They're able to go right out of the platform.
And when you come to Dreamforce, you're going to -- I'm sure that you're going to get to San Francisco. You're going to jump in. Waymo, I think they've got like 500 Waymos down in San Francisco. It's pretty awesome.
I use it myself. And you know what, that's like Agentforce. We're like a Waymo for your customer information and for automating your company, that is, it's autonomous. It's going to get you to where you need to get to.
And, yes, we're still going to have humans in our companies, but we're also going to have these agents. So, these agents don't require a conversational prompt to take action. You can do advanced planning, reasoning with minimal human input. And the example of this incredible healthcare company, you're going to be able to say to the agent, ""Hey, I want to look at my labs.
I want to understand this. It looks like I need repeat labs. Can you reschedule those for me? It looks like I need to see my doctor, can you schedule that for me? I also want to get an MRI. I want to get this."" And the level of automation that we're going to be able to provide and unleash the productivity back into these organizations is awesome.
And why that's important for this healthcare organization or for all of them that we're working with since the pandemic, these doctors and nurses are just so burn out and there's so much activity for them that we're just going to unleash that productivity back to them. So, let the agent handle this simple task and let the doctors and the nurses do what they're going to do best. And that is going to be a powerful moment. So, this is going to be like having these trusted colleagues can handle these time-consuming tasks engaging with these -- whether it's inbound lead or resolving this customer, patient inquiry, or whatever it is, this is humans with agents driving customer success together and Agentforce agents can be set up in minutes, easily scalable, work around with the block, any language.
And by the beginning of next fiscal year, we will have thousands of customers using this platform. And we will have handheld then to make it successful for them, deploy it. The early trials have been remarkable to see these customers have the success, it has been just awesome. And let me give you a great example of Wiley.
Now, it's back-to-school season, Wiley is a long-standing Salesforce customer. It's one of our first deployments in the first Agentforce trial. It's pretty awesome. And you all know they make textbooks and it's back-to-school.
But maybe you don't know that Wiley has to like surge their sales and service organization at back-to-school time when everyone's buying these textbooks. Well, now, they can use agents to do that surge. They don't have to go buy a bunch of gig workers and bring them in. and that age and capacity is so exciting for them.
What we saw with Wiley was, this is a quote from them, ""We're seeing double-digit percentage increase in customer satisfaction and deflection rate compared to older technologies and in these early weeks of our busiest season."" So, that was very reassuring to us. that we have the right thing that's happening. And Wiley has already seen a 50% increase in case resolution. That's with our first generation of Agentforce, as I mentioned, the second generation of Agentforce, which we have with customers already, including some of these amazing organizations like Royal Bank of Canada, ADP, and others is 90% case resolution.
It is an awesome moment in this tech business. OpenTable is another super great story. You all know they are managing 60,000 restaurants, 160 million diners to support. They're on Agentforce now.
They require that incredible scale to deliver top-notch customer service. That's why they're using the product. It's been awesome to get their results, and it can be all kinds of questions resolving basic issues, account activations, reservation management, loyalty point expiration. Agentforce for service can easily answer all of these questions like when do my points expire for a diner asset, a follow-up question like, what about in Mexico? What about -- can I make this change? That's where we're delivering those incredible moments for OpenTable, giving them this kind of productivity enhancement.
So, in addition to this amazing capability Agentforce for service, now Agentforce for sales, you can imagine extending your sales force with SDRs, BDRs who are agents that are going out and building pipeline for you and generating all kind of demand and even really closing deals. So, this is going to drive sales cloud growth. It already is service cloud growth. It already is because customers are going to extend their sales and service organizations and become a lot more productive with these agents.
In the coming months, we're going to release Agentforce agents for other roles, including industry-specific agents, health agents, as I mentioned. Medical, answering all kinds of medical questions, as I mentioned, and we already have that in trial with this amazing healthcare company, sorry, one of the largest Epic databases in the world. And I just can't believe we're already resolving, as I said, 90% of these patients' inquiries. So, this marks a very significant advance in providing this reliable trusted AI.
We're really seeing a transformation of Salesforce. Look, we're still going to automate all these human touch points. We're still going to have our commerce sites. We're still going to have our analytics and visualization capability of managing or we're still going to have humans who are sales organization, service organizations, but we are going to extend it all with this incredible agent capability.
Now, all of this type of performance from our Agentforce platform wouldn't be possible without Data Cloud. One of the reasons that our agents are so accurate is because of the huge amount of data and metadata that we had. And data is the foundation for every AI transformation. And with Data Cloud, we're providing a high-performance data lake that brings together all our customer and business data, federating data from external repositories through this credible zero-copy alliance.
So, customers can use our Data Cloud and then federate and connect to all their other Data Clouds and then we can bring it all together to deliver the super accurate AI, that's why Data Cloud is absolutely our fastest-growing organic product in history. It will be the fastest product to $1 billion -- it's going to probably be the fastest product of $5 billion, $10 billion. In Q2, the number of paid Data Cloud customers grew 130% year over year and the number of customers spending more than $1 million annually have already doubled. In the second quarter alone, and this is amazing, Data Cloud processed 2.3 quadrillion records with 110% platform consumption growth year over year.
That is awesome. Just amazing, the scale and capability. And for CA -- for customers who don't have that turned on yet and working at Dreamforce, we're going to focus on getting every customer on the Data Cloud. For the last 25 years, Salesforce has been deeply committed to building the most capable CRM apps that help our customers connect with their customers in this whole new way.
We've automated every customer touch point and now we're bringing these apps, data, and agents together. It's these three levels, and this is in three separate pieces of code or three different platforms or three different systems. This is one platform. We've rewritten all of our acquisitions, all of our core modules, our Data Cloud, and our agents as one unified platform, which is how we are delivering not only this incredible functionality but this high level of accuracy and capability.
And from this first-hand experience in meeting with these customers around the globe, I can unequivocally tell you that building these agents without a complete integrated platform is like trying to assemble a plane mid-flight, it's risky chaotic and it's not likely to succeed. I mean, I just got back from a Dreamforce focus group, where I met with one of the largest CIOs in the world, is telling me how excited he was for the B2C part of this business, he built this model and accuracy rates, than I was like, really, let me show you what we're doing here. And then he said to me, why am I doing this? Why am I not just using your platform? And I said, good question. So, these customers are spending millions of dollars, but are they really getting the results that they want? It feels like these early days of cloud.
It's just early days of social mobile. Customers feel like they have to DIY it, they don't need to, they can make it all happen themselves. And you can just see that to deliver this very high-quality capability they can use a deeply integrated platform like Salesforce. So, with that, let me just move on to Dreamforce and just say, look, I hope you're going to able to come to Dreamforce.
I'm going to try to encourage everyone to do it. I've told Mike I really want all the analysts there. I want everybody there and all the investors there. We're going to make -- try to give you the highest quality experience to encourage you to do that.
You'll be hearing the details for Mike on that shortly. And you're not going to want to miss it, but you're mostly not going to want to miss it because you're going to want to get your hands on this technology. This is the first time that you're going to see how AI really is going to revolutionize these enterprises. Now, before I hand it off to Brian, I just want to take a moment to thank Amy Weaver.
It has been an incredible 11 years for all of us who work with Amy. She's been an amazing leader across many different parts of our organization as a deeply valued member of our Ohana. She's been a fantastic partner to me personally and over the last few years, in particular, Amy has spearheaded our financial transformation, resulting in an unprecedented margin expansion, increased operational excellence, financial discipline, continued strategic investments, and Salesforce today is better positioned than ever with a phenomenal platform for growth. And luckily for us, Amy has basically going through this amazing transformation with us and now getting ready to go to the next level in her own career, and she will step down at the end of the fiscal year at the end of February, or March and then she will stay with us, I think, until May of '27 to help onboard the new CFO.
And let me just rip on this for just a second. I've had the opportunity to work with so many great executives at Salesforce. And Amy is our fifth CFO. I think all of you know that we've had some great leaders, and we've been fortunate to build our company with some great folks.
I remember Andy, Steve Cakebread, Graham, Mark, and then Amy has been just incredible how she's taken the financials to another level. It's been awesome to work with her. When she originally came to the company 11 years ago, she came in as our general counsel. I think there's been a handful of general counsels who've been able to make the transformation.
I always felt that Amy could do it. I have to say it was my idea that Amy should move from general counsel to being CFO. She has exceeded my expectations, and we've hired Heidrick & Struggles and our good friend, Jeff Sanders, to run a search. We're reviewing internal candidates and external candidates.
We're going to do a comprehensive search. Amy is going to leave that with me. We're going to find another world-class person to be our sixth CFO, which will be awesome. And if you have people that you know that you're interested in this position.
It's a great job, right, Amy?

Pays well, too. It doesn't mean -- it's just fine. And good job satisfaction overall, get all these great events to go to. So, anyway, let sure folks know they can contact Jeff.
And we're looking for that world-class executive to become CFO No. 6, and we couldn't be more grateful to you, Amy, for everything that you do for us every single day. for all that you do in the middle of the pandemic when we couldn't even meet in person, you took over as CFO, you led us through the pandemic. You exited the pandemic.
Now, you're helping us to execute this AI transformation, which is so exciting, and we couldn't be more thrilled. So, congratulations, Amy, and thank you so much for everything again for everything that you have done for the company and for me personally. And with a huge sense of gratitude, I'm going to turn it over to you, Brian.

President and Chief Operating Officer
All of that, particularly the Amy part. I want to echo your comments on Amy, an unbelievable leader who's been an amazing partner to me, an example and role model to so many at our company. I'm just so glad that we have more time with Amy as we work on this transition. I want to start by thanking the team for the strong execution as we continue to operate at tremendous scale and sophistication.
As a result, showed in the quarter, we continue to execute on our core growth pillars with strong momentum in multi-cloud deals, international expansion, industry solutions, Salesforce ecosystem and data and AI innovations across all of our clouds. As you heard from Mark, we're innovating faster than ever. Our new Agentforce platform, which will be generally available in October, is a game changer for our customers and a huge opportunity for us going forward. The feedback I've heard from the pilot customers like Wiley and OpenTable and Fossil has been overwhelmingly positive.
Agentforce is deeply integrated platform combining our core metadata framework in Data Cloud and Einstein and extending the power of our Customer 360 apps in ways that we didn't think possible a year ago, reducing cost, scaling workforces, and dramatically improving customer and employee experiences, all without the headaches of complex, costly model training or DIY AI projects. We're already accelerating this move from AI hype to AI reality for thousands of customers with amazing capabilities across our entire AI product portfolio. New bookings for these products more than doubled quarter over quarter. We signed 1,500 AI deals in Q2 alone.
Some of the world's largest brands are using AI solutions, including Alliant, Bombardier, and CMA CGM. Bombardier, the maker of some of the world's top-performing aircraft, is enabling sales reps to sell smarter by consolidating need-to-know information on prospects in advance of meetings and providing recommendations on how to best engage with them through the Einstein Copilot and prompt builder. The next steps for these companies, of course, will be deploying agents to drive even more automation and productivity. With AI technologies advancing so rapidly, it's been really challenging for our customers to keep pace.
Each of our customers is certainly at a different stage of their AI journey. They're relying on Salesforce as their trusted advisor, their partner with them to -- in this new world where humans and AI are working together. To help our customers navigate this new world, we just launched a new team called Salesforce CTOs. These are deeply technical individuals who work alongside our customers to help them create and execute a plan for every stage of their AI journey to become agent-first companies.
We're continuing our own AI journey internally as a Customer Zero of all of our products with great results. We now have 35,000 employees using Einstein as a trusted AI assistant, helping them work smarter and close deals faster. And since we launched Slack AI in February, our employees have created more than 500,000 channels -- channel summaries, saving nearly 3 million hours of work. We'll, of course, deploy Agentforce agents soon in a variety of different roles and tasks to augment, automate, and deliver productivity and unmatched experiences for all employees and customers at scale.
Echoing what Mark said about Data Cloud, it continues to be highly strategic for our customers as they build foundations for infusing AI across their enterprises. American Family Insurance with millions of policyholders nationwide is using Data Cloud to consolidate data from multiple sources through our zero-copy partner network, creating a 360 view of the customers, enabling quick segmentation, and activating lead data, including their real-time web interactions. The Adecco Group expanded their Data Cloud in the quarter, a great example of a company leveraging its gold mine of data to gain a unified view of its customers. Connecting all this data means that 27,000 Adecco employees using Salesforce will have seamless access to key information, including financial metrics and job fulfillment status, to help Adecco improve their job fill rate ratio and reduce their cost to serve.
In all my conversations with CEOs this quarter, it's clear that we've never been more relevant, especially as companies transition to become AI enterprises. That's why customers continue to trust Salesforce across their most critical touch points with their customers, leading to strong multi-cloud deals in the quarter. As Mark said, nearly 80% of our new business in the quarter was driven by multi-cloud deals. Companies like Wyndham Hotel and Resorts are all-in on Salesforce.
They're using us for Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Data Cloud, Einstein, and MuleSoft to transform its guest experience into a seamless end-to-end journey built in a single interface. Windham utilizes Data Cloud to unify profile of 165 million guest records, many of which were duplicates across many sources like Amazon Redshift and the Sabre Reservation System as well as Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Service Cloud. MuleSoft allows one to unlock business-critical data from various platforms and onboard future franchisees faster. And with Einstein-generated recommended service replies, average call times have been reduced and service agents can focus on higher priority work Slack continues to perform well with wins at Citadel, Converge ICT, and GEICO for the quarter 82 of the Fortune 100 now use Slack Connect every week to better connect with their customers and their partners.
In Q2, Slack IA summarized 420 million Slack messages, and customers have built 13,000 AI apps across their organizations in the last 12 months with Slack. Slack is the conversational interface where humans and agents can come together. Tableau and MuleSoft had solid quarters with Tableau wins at the Department of Interior and RBC Wealth Management and Chewy and MuleSoft wins at Veeam, US Foods, and East Carolina University. Moving on to our international business.
Five of our top 10 deals came from our international teams with wins at Ferrari, Sekisui House, and Commonwealth of Australia. We saw a particular strength in Japan, India, and Canada. We had strong momentum in our industries business as well, and we continue to help our customers save time and money with industry-specific solutions. More than half of our top 100 deals included one of our industry cloud in the quarter, and we continue to innovate on our industry AI capabilities.
At Dreamforce, we're excited to share our new AI tool kit -- industry toolkit, which features more than 100 ready-to-use customizable AI-powered actions. All of these actions can be applied to build industry-specific agents with Agentforce. Salesforce partners continue to drive our growth by helping us drive success at scale, improving time to value, and amplifying our growth in new ways. Our continued focus on go-to-market channel diversification is working well.
And in fact, in the quarter, three of our top 10 deals closed through the AWS marketplace. As Mark mentioned, we're just at the beginning of building an Agentforce ecosystem with companies able to build agents on our platform for their workforce and use cases, and we're excited to have Workday as our first Agentforce partner. In closing, I want to thank the team again. I'm really pleased with the execution in Q2.
Dreamforce is just around the corner, and I can't wait to welcome all of you, either in person or virtually to see for yourself how humans and agents are working together to create new levels of customer success and the next generation of CRM. Now, over to you, Amy.

President and Chief Financial Officer
Great. Mark, Brian, thank you so much for all of the kind words. It has been such a privilege to work with both of you, the entire team of hard-working, dedicated, and compassionate employees at Salesforce. Mark, special thanks to you for your confidence in me and everything you saw, and I will never forget you calling me more than four years ago for the CFO role.
I've rarely been so surprised in my life, but it's been extraordinary. And I also want to thank all of you, our investment community and, in particular, our shareholders, for your continued support of Salesforce. It's been a pleasure working with you on our transformation journey over the last few years. Since my first day as CFO, my focus has been on transforming our business to deliver profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation.
In that time, I am so proud of what we have accomplished, and I look forward to sharing Salesforce on for years to come. So, moving to the quarter, I want to echo Brian and thank the team for their dedication and very strong execution in Q2. Our focus on profitable growth and our disciplined investment strategy led to strong results. Q2 revenue was $9.33 billion, up 8% year over year in nominal and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven primarily by resilience in our core products, license revenue outperformance, and better-than-expected professional services.
Subscription and support revenue grew 9% year over year in nominal and 10% in constant currency. As a reminder, Q1 had benefited from the timing of license revenue in the leap year, resulting in a quarter-over-quarter headwind to Q2 revenue growth. From a geographic perspective, the Americas revenue grew 7% or 8% in constant currency. EMEA grew 11% in both nominal and constant currency, and APAC grew 9% or 16% in constant currency.
We saw strong new business growth in Japan, India, and Canada, while the U.S. and parts of EMEA remains constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q2, public sector HLS, and comms and media performed well. While travel transportation and hospitality and manufacturing automotive and energy were more constrained.
Our subscription support revenue was driven by another quarter of double-digit constant currency growth in both Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, primarily driven by growth in ARPU due to premium mix shift and pricing discipline. And as you've heard from Brian, multi-cloud continues to be a powerful growth lever for us. In Q2, around 16,000 customers added a new cloud and more than 4,500 of those customers added two or more clouds. And we continue to see strong momentum in Data Cloud, which remains one of our fastest-growing organic innovation.
In Q2, our number of paid customers grew 130% year over year, and the number of customers spending more than $1 million annually nearly doubled. Q2 revenue attrition ended the quarter at around 8%, in line with recent quarters. We are continuing to drive leverage across our business with Q2 non-GAAP operating margin of 33.7%, a record, up more than 200 basis points year over year, driven by top-line outperformance and expense discipline. And we are driving strong cash flow due to our profitable growth trajectory.
Q2 operating cash flow was $892 million, up 10% year over year. Q2 free cash flow was $755 million, up 20% year over year. Turning to remaining performance obligation, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract. RPO ended Q2 at $53.5 billion, up 15% year over year.
Current RPO, or CRPO, ended at $26.5 billion, up 10% year over year in nominal currency. This includes a $300 million FX headwind, which results in slightly above 11% year-over-year growth in constant currency. CRPO outperformance was driven largely by bookings execution as well as early renewal favorability. On capital return, I'm happy to say that in Q2, we executed $4.3 billion in share repurchases and issued nearly $400 million in dividends.
This brings our total return to shareholders in the quarter to $4.7 billion, a record-high quarterly return. As a result, we now expect to more than fully offset dilution from FY '25 stock-based compensation. Now, let's turn to guidance, starting with the full fiscal year '25. On revenue, we are holding our guidance of $37.7 billion to $38 billion, growth of approximately 8% to 9% year over year.
A few items to note on our revenue guide. First, on the buying environment, we are assuming that the conditions we've been experiencing over the past few years persist. On FX, our revenue guidance continues to incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year over year or 30 basis points impact. We continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to revenue, and we expect deceleration in our license revenue growth in the back half of the year.
This is due to the tough compare from a very strong performance last year and the volatility of license revenue recognition. For subscription and support revenue, we still expect approximately 10% growth year over year in constant currency. And we expect attrition to remain generally consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year. Now, turning to profitability and cash flow.
On margins, as a result of our strong Q2 performance, we are raising our fiscal '25 non-GAAP operating margin to 32.8%, representing a 230-basis-point improvement year over year. This incorporates intentional investments in growth opportunities, notably AI and Agentforce data and our core businesses. Stock-based compensation is now expected to be 8.4% as a percent of revenue. The modest increase from our prior guidance is primarily a result of the mechanical ESPP reset.
As a result, for fiscal year '25, GAAP operating margin guidance is now expected to be slightly below 20%, representing 530 basis points of improvement year over year, which includes a slight increase in restructuring charges from our ongoing cost transformation. We expect fiscal year '25 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.05 to $6.13. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $10.03 to $10.11. As you have heard us emphasize over the last few quarters, we are focused on driving continued cash flow expansion.
As a result of our disciplined capital deployment, we are raising fiscal year '25 operating cash flow growth to be approximately 23% to 25%, inclusive of cash tax headwind. We now expect capex for the fiscal year to be slightly below 2% of revenue. This now results in free cash flow growth of approximately 25% to 27% for the fiscal year. Now, the guidance for Q3.
On revenue, we expect $9.31 billion to $9.36 billion, up 7% year over year in nominal and constant currency. CRPO growth for Q3 is expected to be 9% year over year in nominal including $100 million FX tailwind. This will result in approximately 8.5% constant currency growth. This is inclusive of the one-point quarter-over-quarter headwind from the very significant deal we closed in Q3 last year.
As a reminder, while we have seen more normalized both recently, CRPO will continue to be materially impacted by the cumulative effect of the previous two years of measured sales performance. For Q3, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.41 to $1.43 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.42 to $2.44. In closing, I am very pleased with our strong execution this quarter as we continue to focus on profitable growth and optimizing free cash flow. And I want to thank our employees and our shareholders for their continued support.
I hope you were able to participate in Dreamforce and see our new Agentforce platform and all of the incredible innovation happening at Salesforce, whether in person or virtually. So, before we open up the call for questions, though, I am going to send it back to Marc.

OK. Well, thanks so much, Amy, and congratulations again on this amazing transition and the success. And you're an awesome General Counsel, you're an even better CFO. Now, we have Sabastian who's delivering the General Counsel capability sitting here at the table with us.
And I can't wait to see who you're going to bring in as the next CFO. So, this next thing, I wish I didn't have to say to all of you, but I'm going to because it's been -- I have a heavy heart. I think all of you know that we lost two amazing board members this quarter with Sandy and Susan. And we are all still processing our grief.
We are all extremely sad, and it's beyond anything that we have experienced as a company or as individuals to have to say goodbye to these two amazing people. And our parts and our spirits and our souls are with them, and also, our condolences are with their families, amazing families, amazing people. They did so much for our company, and they were not just great board members, not just great leaders of our industry, but they were also great friends of the company, but also, personally, they did so much for me. So, I'm so grateful for them, and I miss them every single day.
And I'm sorry that I have to say this on the call because this is the least favorite part of what I do, but I just want to tell everyone how much I love Sandy and Susan and how much I miss them. And I'll turn it over to you, Mike.

Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Congratulations on a really solid quarter. And Amy, really heartbroken see you going.
It's been great working with you over the past four years as CFO. You've done an amazing job in the role. Two-part question, one on sort of the growth equation for Salesforce. A lot of excitement around the generative AI and the new AI capabilities and expanding portfolio there.
We're all really excited about. There's a lot of other parts of the equation that are adding to growth, whether it's industry cloud or international expansion or multi-cloud solution. And maybe a question for Brian. Can you help us understand how to build up the growth equation? Like where are you guys getting those points of growth? And when does GenAI become a more material contributor there.
And then the second question is around pricing. With agents coming into the picture with productivity gains of 90% deflection rates Investors are going to worry about the number of seats being used coming down those productivity gains, how does the pricing change to account for that? So, Salesforce still get the value from these solutions on a go-forward basis? Thank you.
Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Let me open it up and then turn it over to Brian, and because you are right, like this is just a moment, and it's an exciting moment. It is all about growth, and it's all about innovation, and those are two of our specialties here at Salesforce. So, I think when we think about growth for the last 25 years, I'd say we're mostly focused on selling our apps and doing the services around those. And we're going to continue to sell our apps, and we are, and you can see in the quarter, we sold a lot of apps.
And not just selling our apps, but also we're selling our Data Cloud as well. And now we're selling our agents. And not just as core platforms, but also through our verticals, which have been some of our highest-performing capabilities in the company. And you're also right that there are international regions that are growing at incredible rates.
And we see that in Asia. And we also see that in other parts of the world as well, where we continue to see like this double-digit growth. And that has been very inspiring to us. So, it's really a combination of these three things.
The total transformation of the technology stack -- the verticalization of that stack and that international growth is three really core levels of growth, in my mind, I'm going to turn it over to Brian to give you the detail. And then number two, on pricing. When you think about -- when you think about apps and you think about humans because humans use apps, not in all cases. So, for example, the Data Cloud is a consumption product.
The Commerce Cloud is a consumption product. Of course, the email product, Marketing Cloud is a consumption product. Heroku is a consumption product. So, of course, we've had non-human consumption-based products for quite a long time at Salesforce.
But in this idea of agents, when -- I'll just give you my own personal goals. So, I'm not giving any guidance here. My goal is that by the end of fiscal year '26 that we will have 1 billion agents. Already in just looking at the number of consumers identified just in the trials that we have going on, we have like 100 million identified or more, OK, call it, 200 million.
But the funny thing is, of course, it's only one agent. But let's just think it's like a manifestation of all these agents talking to all these consumers. And then when we look at pricing, it will be on a consumption basis. And when we think about that, we think about saying to our customers, and we have, it's about $2 per conversation.
So, that is kind of how we think about it, that we're going to have a lot of agents out there, even though it's only one agent. It's a very high margin opportunity, as you can imagine, and we're going to be reaching -- look, you have to think about these agents are like, this is the new website. This is your new phone number. This is how your customers are going to be connecting with you in this new way, and we're going to be helping our customers to manage these conversations.
And it's probably a per conversational charge as a good way to look at it or we're selling additional consumption credits like we do with our Data Cloud. So, it's a very exciting moment, and I'll turn it over to Brian as well.
Brian Millham

President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Keith. And I appreciate your knowledge of all of our growth strategies here around multi-cloud deals and international acceleration, product, and pricing. I think it's important not to lose track of the fact that these new innovations around Agentforce and Data Cloud and AI and make all of our core apps that much better.
And even in the context of Service Cloud that you're referencing here, our customers are looking at their all-in cost of running a call center. And when you bring a technology that allows you to scale and drive efficiencies in operating that call center, and it's on our technology we're excited about those conversations because we think we get to monetize all of that incredible innovation through the all-in cost there. There are a couple of other things I think you should know about, certainly, our channel diversification as we think about scale and international business through resellers. A big upside for us, I believe, is our AWS Marketplace as a driver going forward.
I mentioned in the comments earlier that three of our top 10 deals went through the marketplace. So, a big opportunity there. And then maybe another one that we haven't talked as much about, but is a big focus for us as we get into the second half of this year and beyond is how do we look at managing our attrition more aggressively going forward as a way to drive growth? How do we make sure that we are driving more adoption, more feature usage, more value derived from our technology to deliver more value to customers so that they get growth off of and efficiencies using our technology? And so many inputs, you know many of them. But as Mark said, this is a new era, and we're excited about the future and the value we can deliver to our customers.

Mark, you made my heart feel heavy as well with Sandy. You might know I used to work for Sandy a long time ago. So, prayers with you. Back to the business, congrats on the quarter, Amy, unbelievable, I do not know anybody who was a Chief Legal Officer and became a successful CFO and led the company through a transformation.
So, you'll go down in history as a very unique person in that regard. One macro thing, Mark, you've been through so many cycles before. Do you think rate reductions -- and post elections, it might be more conducive selling environment at a high level? And also, the micro question with AI. Clearly, the debate is it's going to create so much productivity that we need fewer people.
Clearly, your idea is that we're going to float agents out there. But how confident are you that based on everything that you've seen so far that the world might not need more seats and that you don't have to be entirely dependent only on consumption that this might actually further penetration of seats and it might be about who is not using AI and they are going to be losers versus people that aren't using AI? So, how does this play out in your view, and you've been through the cloud battle and all that? So, I'd love your perspective. Thank you.
Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, thanks, Kash. And yes, our hearts are with Sandy's family and with his wife, Nancy, and his daughters. Thank you for saying that so much. I think -- let me just tell you two quick stories.
I kind of told you one already in the script, which is we're working with this very large healthcare organization. And it's been our lifelong dream to be able to do more with this company, and they are a large Epic user. They have a huge EMR system. We do a lot of patient relationship management, which is just keeping in touch with their customers.
But this is different because what happens now is -- and we all have this experience, we go get our labs done. They draw your blood you get your numbers and then you get a number and you're in Epic, and it says, ""Oh, this is out of range, or this isn't right or this seems higher or lower than it was before. And I need to talk to my doctor right now."" And after the pandemic, everyone's health anxiety is just a lot higher, and doctors just get a lot more calls, and nurses are just far more active than ever before. And what happens is these doctors and nurses are facing a lot of burnout.
You can talk to any major healthcare organization, and we work with them all. So, in this case, this is Agentforce is now resolving in this trial, 90% -- more than 90% of these patients improves. So, you can imagine for these doctors and nurses not getting these calls, how that is, but Agentforce is more than that. It's not just saying hey, my cholesterol is higher, this is happening whatever.
It also, you're saying, what's my next step? And I would like to reschedule a doctor's appointment for you, ""Oh, I want to get lab street drawn for you in 30 days,"" which is a common technique that a doctor will say is, ""Yes, that lab that may not be accurate, let's just retest or you know what, this requires you to get an MRI or a CT scan and I've scheduled that for you."" And all of that is happening through the agent. So, you can imagine every healthcare company, every hospital, every organization of the world needing that and that is not what we do today exactly. That's not exactly where our business is. So, this is a huge new opportunity for us to now come in and say, ""Yes, we're going to do patient relationship management with our Health Cloud.
And we're still going to help coordinate and communicate and connect with all your patients. But now we're also helping to just dramatically improve the productivity of your organization."" Another example is very large computer hardware companies doing a major acquisition and huge customer of ours, and they're reconceptualizing their whole business, and they just want to be a very they want to just look at where do they want to be in terms of how they're selling and servicing their customers in five years. And I said to the CEO, I have spent a long time with I've known for a long time, hey, we're going to build you an agent first organization. And you're going to be agent first in sales and agent first in service, and we're going to turn you into a margin machine, and that's the goals of this implementation.
And that is not a conversation that I've had with a customer for exactly like that. So, yes, we're going to continue to automate their whole organization but we have to not just build them a great sales force or a service force or marketing force or commerce force, analytics force or whatever, we have to build them an Agentforce. And that is we're going from today 0% market share in agents. And obviously, our goal is to be the agent supplier to our customers, which has to be deeply integrated into our data and our apps because these agents, at some point, are going to say, ""Actually, I want to pass you off to a human now to talk and complete this."" And there's a seamless automatic handshake between our agents and our apps because it's just one platform, by the way.
So, it's one database, one platform, seamless handshake. It's one integrated system. That's a pretty big thought. And I think we can really take our customers' capabilities to a whole new level.
This is just a part of technology that has never existed before. So, I'm excited about this, Kash. I have always been excited about our apps, and I have obviously been very excited about our Data Cloud. Now, I'm very excited about the agents and how it all wraps together and how it leverages our decade of AI experience.
And how our team has executed on this opportunity has just been remarkable.

Hi. Yes, thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on a nice quarter. And Amy, thanks so much for all your efforts over the last four years.
It's been a pleasure working with you. Mark, one of the questions I have for you is, obviously, one of the challenges with AI from an enterprise perspective has been the complexity, the security risks. You brought this up before. So, how quickly can existing customers get up and running with Agentforce? And is Data Cloud a prerequisite for driving value? Or is that just something that sort of takes it to another level? Thanks.
Marc Russell Benioff
--
Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's a great question. And the CSAT scores on Agentforce right in this kind of trials have been extremely high, I think four out of five. And customers can get going almost immediately, and we're going to prove that for them actuators. And then we're going to go out there and we're going to we're going to -- through our world tours and all of our programs, which are going to be Agentforce tours, we're going to go hand-in-hand and work to implement tens of thousands of customers over the next six months.
And Step 1 was building the platform that is deeply integrated while Data Cloud makes it all a lot better, you do not need Data Cloud to make it work, but we encourage it because you're just going to get so much better accuracy. And you need this anyway and the new version of Tableau, which we've already been showing, which is awesome, is built on Data Cloud, you hit a button, and it fully visualizes everything. So, you have all your agents are working, your salespeople are working, your service people are working. You're setting up these emails.
You're talking commerce on your website and then you hit a button and boom, Tableau visualizes all of it for you and it's all one integrated platform. So that's really our vision of where it's going. And I think that that is very compelling for our customers. When we bought these companies starting with ExactTarget and Demandware and Tableau, we didn't really -- even Slack, are we going to really integrate rewrites, do we really need to that loosely coupled was working really well.
But now, with the shift to AI, it just became clear 18 months ago, we need to hit the accelerator pedal and rewrite all these things onto the core platform because customers are going to get this incredible value by having one integrated system, and it scales from small companies to extremely large companies. And that is what I am super excited about, and we just brought all of our 500 top executives together, and we showed all of our -- how we've changed all of our products, and I think everyone was just stunned and I'm looking forward to showing that at Dreamforce because I think customers will just be so motivated not only at the quality of the new apps, which are all AI-driven but also that they're able to extend it with these incredible new capabilities, which are indeed huge growth drivers for us going forward. And by the way, also huge points of differentiation. The last point is this, these customers they're still going to build models, but it's in our platform.
They're still going to fine-tune those models in our platform. They're going to still use our AI studios and build their own prompts in our platform there -- all of it runs in our platform, and that's how they deliver this incredible capability. And if you've seen some of the architecture and graphics and how I've changed the architecture of the -- and how we talk about the company, it's really about in this one, two, three approach, the apps, the data and the agents, but it's all AI-centric. It's all -- and it's not -- you're not going to have to DIY.
And it just -- it is driving me a little crazy, as you probably heard, like when I meet with these customers and they think I need to build my own model, I have to train my own model after retrain, and they are spending a lot of money on this craziness and it's not working. So, it is a disappointment that Microsoft has convinced so many customers and others to move some of these model companies who are just regulated at this point to be in commodities that they have to be customized for stuff. It's not true. It can be done in a platform approach and it's better, easier, lower cost, and we're -- this technology will -- we are proving it, and we'll show it.
And if you talk to these customers have already deployed at the open tables, the Wileys, the Wyndhams, the RBCs, there's a lot of customers who don't want me to use their name, so I'm cautious. But it's just very clear this is going to really dramatically make everything better.

I think everyone probably wants to understand kind of why now, what was the decision and maybe it's just simply 11 great years and ready for the next chapter, but I think everyone would love to hear your perspective on your decision. And for Brian, when you look at the Americas business, you were running double-digit growth. It went to one of the lowest levels we've seen in our model around 8%. What does it take to get back to double-digit growth? Is there a saturation issue? Is this competitive? Give us a sense of kind of what you think is happening in the Americas region.
Amy E. Weaver

Brent, I was not expecting that question, but I'm happy to address it. And again, thank you for the very nice comments, Keith, Kash, Kirk, and please know how much I've enjoyed working with all of you, and I will certainly be on the next earnings call and possibly the one after that as we do ourselves.
Marc Russell Benioff

No, no, you definitely will.
Amy E. Weaver

President and Chief Financial Officer
Definitely. All right. We're not moving that fast on to the third. So, we'll have plenty of time, I forgot goodbyes at that point.
In terms of my decision, it has been an absolutely extraordinary 11 years, I think a journey is just a journey that anyone would be extraordinarily lucky to have. The last four years have been amazing as CFO. I really came in and I remember giving a listening tour with our shareholders, my first couple months, and they told me the top two things on their minds were op margin and dilution. And I set out to see what we could do on both of those.
And nearly four years later, we've raised -- we've almost doubled the operating margin. It was 17% in my first year. We're going to be close to 33% this year. We initiated a buyback program with close to $20 billion.
And this year, we layered in a dividend program. We have dealt with all sorts of other incredible opportunities along the way. I think I've managed to pack in about four decades of CFO experiences in four years. This feels like the right time for me to really focus on a very smooth transition of finding the next CFO, making sure to relax and recharge, and looking at new adventures.
So, thank you for the question. And Brian, over to you.
Brian Millham
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Really a tough transition from that. Brent, thanks for the question. First of all, as you know, Americas is the biggest business we have at Salesforce and where we've had a ton of success for many, many years. I would not characterize that market is saturated.
And I would not say the competition is what's holding us back. I think the measured buying environment is really what's impacted the largest business we have. In particular, the transactional business and SMB business is very large in that market. And so, it's going to feel the measured buying environment's weighted heavily in that market.
And so, I would not position it that way that we're saturated at all. In fact, I think when you look at our new technology, the new innovation that's coming, the multi-cloud deals that we're bringing, and a very happy customer base. I think we have a huge opportunity to go turn that business around and get it back to double-digit growth. And so, big opportunity, and love all the innovation that's coming out of our product and development teams because our customers need it and they're looking for us to guide them into this future.
So, thanks for the question, and very much looking forward to seeing that growth back at double digits in the Americas.

Executive Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, Regina. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2025 third quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, president and chief financial officer; and Brian Millham, president and chief operating officer.

Some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, which could change. Should any of these risks materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
A description of these risks and uncertainties, and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in our SEC filings, including our most recent report on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and any other SEC filings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any responsibility to update these forward-looking statements. And with that, let me hand the call over to Marc.

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
All right. Well, hey, thanks so much, Mike, and I just really appreciate everybody being on the call today. We have so many exciting things to talk about and I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving. We're incredibly excited about these results that we've delivered in the quarter and very strong performance across revenue, operating margin, cRPO, and cash flow.
But as I'm sure everybody knows on the quarter, these numbers are not what we're really excited about at Salesforce. And while the quarter numbers are fantastic, the real excitement is really what is hitting with the technology. And I'm really excited to talk to you about that. But before we do, let's do talk about that incredible financial transformation that we've undergone over the last few years.
You're going to hear more from Brian and Amy about what we're doing to redefine success, delivering this kind of financial value for our customers, but achieving these incredible results. So, this is about so much more than another great quarter. We're really at the edge of a revolutionary transformation. This is really the rise of digital labor.
Now for last -- I would say for the last 25 years at Salesforce, and we've been helping companies to manage and share their information and you can see that across our whole product line and whether it's in sales or service or marketing or commerce, whether it's analytics, Slack across the board but now we've really created a whole new market, a new TAM, a TAM that is so much bigger and so much more exciting than the data management market, it's hard to get our head completely around. This is the market for digital labor. And Salesforce has become right out of the gate here, the largest supplier of digital labor, and this is just the beginning and it's all powered by these autonomous AI agents. All of you know that.
This is fundamentally reshaping how businesses operate. It's fundamentally reshaping how we operate our business and how we think about the industry itself and how you're thinking about the industry, how we're thinking about Salesforce. And with Salesforce Agentforce, we're not just imagining this future, we're already delivering it. And you still know that in the last week of the quarter, Agentforce went into production.
We delivered 200 deals and our pipeline is incredible for future transactions. We can talk about that with you on the call, but we've never seen anything like it. We don't know how to characterize it. This is really a moment where productivity is no longer tied to workforce growth, but through this intelligent technology that can be scaled without limits.
And Agentforce represents this next evolution of Salesforce. This is a platform now, Salesforce is a platform where AI agents work alongside humans in a digital workforce that amplifies and augments human capabilities and delivers with unrivaled speed. And you can see that, I'm going to get into it, you go to help.salesforce.com, you can see we've unleashed that on our entire support organization already. We've created this incredible agentic layer around the whole company.
And this is just the beginning of a complete digital transformation for the world. On top of this agentic layer, we'll soon see a robotic layer as well where these agents will manifest into robots. And how all of this is going to change society is only visible today in the movies or in our imaginations, but we can see it unfolding right here through this company, Salesforce. And that is what we are really excited about.
These agents are not tools, they are becoming collaborators. They're working 24/7 to analyze data, make decisions, take action, and we can all start to picture this enterprise managing millions of customer interactions daily with Agentforce seamlessly resolving issues, processing transactions, anticipating customer needs, freeing up humans to focus on the strategic initiatives and building meaningful relationships. And this is going to evolve into customers that we have, whether it could be a large hospital or a large hotel where not only are the agents working 24/7, but robots are also working side-by-side with humans, robots, manifestations of agents, this idea that it's all happening before our eyes and this isn't just some far-off future, it's happening right now. And with Agentforce, we're unleashing this new era of digital labor for every business and every industry.
And the implications are just simply profound. For decades, economic growth depended on expanding the human workforce, it was all about getting more labor, but with labor and with the labor force stagnating globally, Agentforce is unlocking a new path forward. It's a new level of growth for the world and for our GDP and businesses no longer need to choose between scale and efficiency with agents, they can achieve both. And our customers are already experiencing this transformation.
Agentforce is deflecting service cases and resolving issues, processing, qualifying leads, helping close more deals, creating optimizing marketing campaigns, all at an unprecedented scale 24/7. We all saw this unfolding at Dreamforce in San Francisco. You were all there, I really appreciate you all coming and being with us. But I think what you saw and what was remarkable was the huge thirst that our customers had for this and how they built more than 10,000 agents in three days.
And I think you know that we then unleashed a world tour of that program and we have now built thousands and thousands of more agents in these world tours all over the world, giving our customers the ability to understand and get their hands on the technology and envision, for their own companies, what they're going to do. And now, we're seeing this demand for Agentforce like, as I've said, just became available on October 24th, and we're already seeing this incredible velocity, more than 200 Agentforce deals just in Q3. It doesn't mean anything because the pipeline is in the thousands for potential transactions that are coming up in future quarters. So, companies like FedEx, Adecco, Accenture, ACE Hardware, IBM, RBC Wealth Management, and many more are now building their digital labor forces on the Salesforce platform with Agentforce.
So, that is the largest and most important companies in the world across all geographies, across all industries are now building and delivering agents. And Salesforce is unique as we are perhaps one of the only companies at scale in enterprise that is now delivering this globally. We could not be more excited, we could not be more proud of our teams, our technology teams, our engineering teams, our product teams, our marketing teams, and our distribution teams who are getting this to market first. And look, we are not only prepared for this agent-based, agent-first future, we're leading it for our customers and ourselves.
And as you know, we pride ourselves on being customer zero for all of our products and Agentforce is no exception. We're excited to share that Agentforce is now live on help.salesforce.com. I hope that you've all gone there and checked it out. And you might have also noticed that we have a test going on for our U.S.
customers where we put an agent at the front of our website as well to kind of see what that is like. This is an ungrounded agent, but it's really a vision for what the potential of what agents can be doing at every part of marketing, our help portal, help.salesforce.com, which is now live. This portal, this is our primary support mechanism for our customers. It lets them authenticate in, it then becomes grounded with the agent and that help portal already is handling 60 million sessions and more than 2 million support cases every year.
Now that is 100% on Agentforce. It's going to have dramatic implications for our company from not only the technology point of view, but also from a human resource point of view, where we can really start to look at how are we going to rebalance our headcount into areas that now are fully automated and two, into areas that are critical for us to grow like distribution. I think you've all heard that we're trying to hire 1,000, 2,000 more salespeople because we see not only maximized our productivity of our current Salesforce over the last couple of years, but we just need to grow and expand to reflect this incredible distribution opportunity. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to really help customers achieve something they could never have done before.
And while these legacy chatbots have handled these basic tasks like password resets and other basic mundane things, Agentforce is really unlocking an entirely new level of digital intelligence and operational efficiency at this incredible scale. Now when you use help.salesforce.com, especially as an authenticated user, as I mentioned, you're going to see this incredible level of accuracy and responsiveness and you're going to see remarkably low hallucinogenic performance, whether for solving simple queries or navigating complex service issues, because Agentforce is not just grounded in our Salesforce data and metadata, including the repository of 740,000 documents in 17 languages. It's also grounded in each customer's data, their purchases, returns, that data, it's that 200 petabytes or 200 to 300 petabytes of Salesforce data that we have that gives us this kind of, I would say, almost unfair advantage with Agentforce because our agents are going to be more accurate and the least hallucinogenic of any because they have access to this incredible capability. An Agentforce can instantly reason over this vast amounts of data, deliver precise personalized answers with citations in seconds and Agentforce can seamlessly hand off to support engineers delivering them complete summary and recommendation as well.
And you can all try this today. This isn't some fantasy land future idea, this is today, reality. And I just want to compare and contrast that against other companies who say they are doing enterprise AI. You can look at even Microsoft.
We all know about Copilot. It's been out, it's been touted now for a couple of years. We've heard about Copilot. We've seen the demos.
In many ways, it's just repackaged ChatGPT that you can really see the difference where Salesforce now can operate its company on our platform. And I don't think you're going to find that on Microsoft's website, are you? I know many of you are specialists in Microsoft, go ahead and try to find this running on microsoft.com and I will be looking forward to getting your responses. Look, we expect that our own transformation with Agentforce on help.salesforce.com and in many other areas of our company is going to deflect between a quarter and a half of our annual case volume and in optimistic cases, probably much, much more of that. Agentforce is going to deliver the same unprecedented accuracy, speed, and cost savings to our customers.
Now, when we look at customers that are starting to implement this today, there's a lot of great examples. One of them is the smart home security provider, Vivint. They've struggled with this high volume of support calls, a high churn rate for service reps, it's a common story. But now using Agentforce, Vivint is creating a digital support staff to autonomously provide support through their app, their website, troubleshooting, a broad variety of issues across all their customer touchpoints.
And in addition, Vivint is planning to utilize Agentforce to further automate technician scheduling, payment requests, proactive issue resolution, the use of device telemetry because Agentforce is across the entire Salesforce product line and including Slack. So, now, here's another great customer example that's already incredible the work they've already done to get this running and going in their company at Adecco, the world's leading provider of talent solutions, handling 300 million job applications annually, but historically they have just not been able to go through or respond in a timely way, of course, to the vast majority of applications that they're getting. But now the Agentforce can operate at incredible scale sorting through the millions of resumes, 24/7 matching candidates to opportunities proactively pre-qualifying them for recruiters. And in addition, Agentforce can also assist candidates, helping them to refine their resumes, giving them a better chance of qualifying for a role.
Now listen, we've been talking on these earnings calls for, I don't know, more than a year, maybe two years, why Salesforce has an unfair advantage in AI. I think we took one earnings call just to talk about the power of data and what the power of data meant for Salesforce. Now you're really seeing that get manifested right into the customer themselves and getting that value. We're not just delivering the philosophy anymore, we're really showing you that, yes, Salesforce is already the largest supplier of enterprise AI in the world, 2 trillion Einstein transactions a week, no one is delivering this level of enterprise AI that we are.
But now, we're not just delivering that Einstein transaction, we're delivering these incredible Agentforce capabilities as well. This is a bold leap into the future of work where AI agents with humans unite to transform all of our customer interactions. Another powerful example is a nonprofit, College Possible. College Possible matches eligible students with counselors to help them navigate and become ready for college.
And in California, for example, the statewide average stands at slightly over one counselor for every 500 students. It just isn't enough. Where are we going to get all that labor? Well, we know whether we're going to get that labor, we're going to get it from Agentforce. This means the vast majority of students are not getting the help they need and now they are going to get the help they need.
College Possible creates a virtual counselor built on Agentforce in under a week. They already had all the data, they had the metadata, they already knew the students, they already had all of the capabilities built into their whole Salesforce application. It was just a flip of the switch. I mean, you have to think about that for just a second.
We have 135,000 customers and those 135,000 customers have now been endowed with Agentforce. It's in every single one of those implementations today. It's just a switch that needs to get flipped on. And our job is to motivate, to excite, to inspire our customers to turn that switch on right now.
And when you look at College Possible, yes, it's very exciting, any college, any high-school student will have access to this college counselor that knows about their goals, their transcripts, all the information on the colleges that can deliver this highly personalized experience for them. But why? It's because all of the work and the data and the capability that College Possible has put in the Salesforce over the years and years that they had it. It's not the week that it took to get them to turn it on. They have done a lot of work.
And when you look at those 135,000 customers that we have, they have so much work in the Salesforce to organize and get all that data and workflow ready and now they can just turn those agents on. No,w we're working with across all kinds of industries to do so many different and exciting areas. We could go on and on and on. Now, over the last few years, we've really aggressively invested in integrating all of our apps on a single core platform with shared services for security, workflow, user interfaces, and more.
We've been rewriting all of our acquisitions into that common area. We're really looking at how do we take all of our applications and all of our acquisitions, everything, and deliver it into one consistent platform, we call that More Core internally inside the Salesforce. And when you look at that More Core initiative, I don't think there's anyone who delivers this comprehensive platform, sales, service, marketing, commerce, analytics, Slack, all of it as one piece of code. And then now deeply integrated in that one piece of code is also our data cloud.
That is a key part of our strategy, which continues to have this phenomenal momentum as well to help customers unify and federate with zero-copy data access across all their data and metadata, which is crucial for AI to work. And now that third layer is really opening up for us, which is this agentic layer. We have built this agentic layer that takes advantage of all the investments in Salesforce for our customers and made it in our platform. It's really these three layers.
And in these three layers form a complete AI system for enterprises and really uniquely differentiate Salesforce uniquely differentiate Agentforce from every other AI platform in that this is one piece of code. This isn't like three systems, it's not a bunch of different apps all running independently. This is all one piece of code. That's why it works so well, by the way, because it is one platform.
And we understand that this extraordinary technology also requires us to have some kind of extraordinary responsibility. At Salesforce, trust is our No. 1 value, it's never been more critical, especially with this pioneering new technology. We're committed to building Agentforce with accountability and fairness and transparency at the core and we've been focusing on empowering our customers and partners to also navigate this era, equipping them with the tools, skills, and education to thrive in an AI-driven economy.
You know that because you've heard so many presentations and thoughts on this that we've put together with our team and because we, obviously, this is just our latest moment in AI. So, the transformation is not without challenges, jobs are going to evolve, roles are going to shift and businesses will need to adapt. And listen, at Salesforce, jobs are going to evolve and roles will shift and businesses will need to adapt as well. We're all going to need to rebalance our workforces as agents take on more of the workforce and then we can rebalance and reshape our companies in new ways.
History has shown us that with every disruption comes an explosion of new opportunities. This morning, I was on the phone with one of our large customers and they were telling me how they're targeting inside their company 25% more efficiency with Artificial Intelligence, incredible goal. This is an incredible moment. Entire industries are going to emerge fueled by innovation and creativity of people using Agentforce to solve challenges to reach new heights.
It's just the beginning of a level of innovation and change that none of us have really ever seen. It's a radical expansion of our total addressable market. And it's really the beginning of a change that we're going to see that's including agents, that's going to include robots, that's going to include the use of the data and the metadata and all the technology that we've been pioneering now for the last several decades. This is more than a technological revolution.
It's an opportunity to create a better future for all of us. And at Salesforce, we believe business is the greatest platform for change. And with Agentforce, we're leading the way into a new horizon of digital labor. We're excited to take this vision for deploying a digital labor force for every organization even further.
And you're going to now, and this is incredible even to be able to say this because we just introduced Agentforce in October, but I want to invite all of you to join us for the launch of Agentforce 2.0. And it is incredible what you are going to see, the advancements in the technology already are amazing in accuracy, in the ability to deliver even additional value. And we hope that you're going to join us in San Francisco. This is going to happen on December 17th.
You'll see Agentforce 2.0 for the first time and you're not going to believe it, you're not going to want to miss it. And now, over to Brian.

President and Chief Operating Officer
Hey, thanks, Marc. Really appreciate it. I've been at Salesforce almost as long as Marc and Parker and this is the most exciting time in my career. As a company, we redefined enterprise software with cloud and social and mobile and predictive AI over the past 25 years and now we're doing it again with Agentforce.
As Marc said, this is the beginning of a revolutionary transformation that will fundamentally redefine how we work and how work gets done. Our strong results in the quarter reflect the trust our customers, partners, and stakeholders have in Salesforce to lead them into this new agent-first world. We made great progress in the quarter against Salesforce growth pillars, first and foremost with Agentforce and Data Cloud, but also with our multicloud deals, international expansion, industry solutions, and our ecosystem. Agentforce will enable companies to achieve a new era of abundance with more efficiency, more productivity, even stronger customer relationships, higher margins, and higher revenues across every industry.
It's a new technology model and a new business model, and we've built a complete agent-first platform for customers that will save them millions of dollars and provide them with limitless workforces to drive greater value. Companies like Remarkable and Wiley are already seeing incredible results. Wiley, an early adopter is resolving cases over 40% faster with Agentforce than their previous chatbot. Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, will be able to respond to thousands of travelers' inquiries instantly, accurately and simultaneously.
SharkNinja, a new logo in the quarter, chose Agentforce and Commerce Cloud to deliver 24x7 personalized support for customers across 28 international markets and unifying its service operations. Our customer success with Agentforce and our AI solutions is driving strong results. In Q3, the number of wins greater than $1 million with AI more than tripled year over year and we signed more than 2,000 AI deals, including more than the 200 Agentforce wins that Marc shared. To capture this increased demand for Agentforce, we're hiring 1,400 AEs globally in our fourth quarter and we're also using new sales SDR agent and sales coaching agent to augment every seller.
We're also seeing amazing Agentforce energy across the ecosystem with our global partners involved in 75% of our Q3 Agentforce deals in nine of our top 10 wins in the quarter. Over 80,000 system integrators have completed Agentforce training and hundreds of ISVs and technology partners are building and selling agents. And our partners are also becoming agent-first enterprises themselves. In the quarter, Accenture chose Agentforce to streamline sales operations and enhance bid management for its 52,000 global sellers.
By integrating sales coach and custom AI agents, Agentforce is improving deal quality and targeting a 75% boost in bid coverage. We see an incredible future with Agentforce, not only for our customers but also for us. As customer zero, we can leverage Agentforce ourselves to realize the benefits of digital labor for us to amplify and augment our human workforce. Marc talked about how we've reimagined Salesforce customer service with Agentforce, while we're also deploying Agentforce to engage our prospects on Salesforce.com, answering their questions 24x7, as well as handing them off to our SDR team.
You can see it for yourself and test it out on our homepage. We'll use our new Agentforce SDR agent to further automate top-of-funnel activities from gathering leads, lead data for providing education, and qualifying prospects and booking meetings. Initiatives like this and many others mean Salesforce will become a new lever for productivity, growth, and efficiency for Salesforce, which should save millions of hours and free up hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvest into our strategic growth initiatives. Becoming an agent-first enterprise starts with having unified data.
That's why we continue to see amazing momentum with Data Cloud, which was included in eight of our top 10 wins in the quarter. Today, 25% of the Fortune 100 are Data Cloud customers. Marc mentioned the Adecco Group, they're centralizing more than 40 instances in legacy systems with Data Cloud to build a foundation to implement Agentforce at scale. Usage is a key indicator for our product's value to our customers and our customers are now processing 767 trillion records every month.
Indeed, the world's leading job site hires three people every second on its platform. Using Data Cloud as its go-to-market data architecture Indeed matches 580 million job seeker profiles with over 3 million employers with Agentforce Indeed aims to have time to hire and help 3 million people overcome employment barriers by 2030. IBM, one of our valued strategic partners selected Data Cloud in the quarter to enhance their global client service with a unified view of all client interactions and actionable usage insight they can deliver even more efficient personalized experiences. Proprietary unstructured data is a powerful fuel for AI and we're excited that we were able to close the acquisition of Zoomin to accelerate and unlock the unstructured data to power AI agents, making them more personalized and context-aware for every customer interaction.
We also finalized our acquisition of the Own Company. Own's data management capabilities complement our existing offerings and will strengthen data security, privacy, and compliance across our platform. As Marc described, Agentforce is a game-changer for our core products, enabling customers to leverage AI-powered insights and actions directly in the flow of work across our entire product portfolio. This is evidenced by the strong demand for Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, both of which achieved double-digit growth in Q3.
We also just wrapped up another incredible Cyber Week during which Commerce Cloud powered close to 50 million orders on digital storefronts with nearly 100% uptime. Salesforce powered nearly 60 billion AI-powered product recommendations, a 21% increase year over year and over 56 billion marketing messages were sent via Marketing Cloud. Service Cloud also helped our customers field and resolve 3.8 billion cases. Clearly, the scale, reliability, intelligence of our integrated platform is unmatched.
And we continue to see solid momentum with Slack with wins at Capital One, SNAP, Rivian, and Volkswagen Group Technology. Annual spend on Slack AI grew nearly 50% quarter over quarter and Slack was included in more than a third of our deals greater than $1 million. Since the release of Slack AI, our customers have summarized over 600 million messages, saving them a collective 1.1 million hours. Tableau and MuleSoft continue to be foundational and fundamental to our customers' transformations.
In the quarter, Tableau had wins at Allegis, SiriusXM, and Hitachi; and MuleSoft had wins at Northwell Health, 3M, and CalOptima Health. Our industry clouds continue to fuel our growth with strong demand in highly regulated industries like healthcare, notably, our new agent-first Life Science Cloud was in three of our top 10 deals in the quarter. We also saw strong momentum internationally with wins at Brenntag and Finnair, once again, half of our top 10 wins for the quarter were international. We continue to unlock customer spend through new channels, including the Agentforce partner network that launched at Dreamforce, which allows customers to customize and deploy specialized agents using trusted third-party extensions from Salesforce AppExchange.
And AWS Marketplace continues to be a growth driver. Our Q3 transactions doubled quarter over quarter with 10 deals exceeding $1 million. Salesforce's business and financial performance has delivered unprecedented results and we're doing it again with our product transformation and Agentforce. We're starting Q4 with strong momentum and no one is better positioned to capture the massive Agentforce opportunity ahead.
Now over to you, Amy.

President and Chief Financial Officer
Great. Thanks, Brian. As you heard from Marc and Brian, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with Agentforce. To simply put, Salesforce is uniquely positioned to become the leading enterprise AI platform and the source of a digital workforce for companies around the globe.
And as customer zero for Agentforce, we're already seeing a significant pickup in case deflections for our customer service organizations. This is just the beginning of a new world of humans and AI agents working together to fundamentally reshape the economics of business. As Marc mentioned, we've been on a financial transformation over the past several years and you'll see it in our results. Q3 represents another quarter of focused execution leading to strong outcomes.
Q3 revenue was $9.44 billion, up 8% year over year in nominal and constant currency, driven by resilience in our core clouds. Subscription and support revenue grew 9% year over year in nominal and constant currency, led by another quarter of double-digit growth in both sales and service, driven by strong ARPU growth. As expected, this was partially offset by deceleration in our license revenue growth in MuleSoft and Tableau in Q3 on tough prior-year compares. From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue grew 6% in nominal and constant currency, EMEA grew 12% or 9% in constant currency and APAC grew 16% or 14% in constant currency.
We saw strong new business growth in LatAm, Canada, and Australia, while the United States and parts of EMEA remained constrained. From an industry perspective, in Q3, health and life sciences, manufacturing, and automotive and energy all performed well, while retail and consumer goods were more measured. Our multi-cloud momentum continues with our top-25 deals averaging more than five clouds each. Now you hear us talk about this metric every quarter.
It's an incredible proof point that our customers trust Salesforce to transform their entire customer experience from sales to service to marketing and commerce to analytics and integration. But our multi-cloud strategy is also core to our financial strategy. Multi-cloud customers have higher spend, lower attrition rates and drive significant ARR expansion for us each quarter. That's because Salesforce is the only company that can deliver a 360-degree view of your customers, which is essential for every company as we move into an agent-first world.
Data Cloud also continues to be the foundation for every AI transformation and it was included in one-third of all of our deals this quarter over $1 million. As you heard from Brian, Data Cloud helps unlock AI with our customers. And that's why eight of our top 10 deals included both Data Cloud and AI, inclusive of Agentforce. This is really the model for all future transactions.
Q3 revenue attrition ended the quarter slightly above 8%, in line with recent quarters. Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%, up 190 basis points year over year, driven by top-line outperformance and disciplined expense management. And I am very pleased to share that this quarter, our GAAP operating margin hit 20% for the first time in company history. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $2.41, inclusive of a $0.18 charge driven by mark-to-market adjustments of our strategic investments portfolio.
Excluding this impact, non-GAAP EPS would have been $2.59, well ahead of our guidance. Q3 operating cash flow was $2 billion, up 29% year over year. Q3 free cash flow was $1.8 billion, up 30% year over year. Turning to remaining performance obligations.
RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, ended Q3 at $53.1 billion, up 10% year over year. Current RPO or cRPO, ended at $26.4 billion, an increase of slightly more than 10% year over year in nominal currency. This includes a $100 million FX tailwind, which results in 10% year-over-year growth in constant currency. cRPO outperformance was driven by early renewal favorability and strong new bookings performance.
Of note, on the bookings performance, over the past couple of quarters, we have seen stabilization in our transactional businesses, most notably Create and Close and SMB. One call out on the Q3 cRPO results. As you heard from Marc, Agentforce's momentum in Q3 was incredible with over 200 deals closed in only one week. However, given we are early in our adoption cycle, it is not yet a material contributor to cRPO.
On capital return, in Q3, we executed $1.2 billion in share repurchases and paid nearly $400 million in dividends. This brings our total return to shareholders in the quarter to $1.6 billion. Through our capital return program, we continue to expect to more than fully offset dilution from our FY'25 stock-based compensation. And I'm pleased to share that since inception of our capital allocation program, total capital returns have now surpassed $20 billion.
Now let's turn to guidance. Note that after the end of our third quarter, we closed our acquisitions of the Own Company and Zoomin. As such, our guidance incorporates contributions from both these deals. Let's start with the full fiscal year '25.
On revenue, we are raising the low end of our guidance range to $37.8 billion and maintaining the high end at $38 billion, growth of approximately 8% to 9% year over year, reflecting the strong execution and revenue outperformance over the last two quarters. For subscription and support revenue, we still expect approximately 10% growth year over year in constant currency. A few reminders on our revenue guide. On FX, our revenue guidance continues to incorporate a $100 million FX headwind year over year or a 30 basis-point impact.
We continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to revenue growth. And as we shared last quarter, our guidance incorporates deceleration in our license revenue growth in the back half of this year. On attrition, we expect attrition to remain consistent at slightly above 8% for the full year. Now turning to profitability and cash flow.
On margins, we are pleased to raise our fiscal year '25 non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 32.9%, representing a 240-basis-point improvement year over year. This incorporates intentional investments in growth opportunities, most notably in Agentforce and Data Cloud. As we said last quarter, stock-based compensation is still expected to be approximately 8.4% as a percent of revenue. For fiscal year '25, GAAP operating margin guidance continues to be slightly below 20%, representing 540 basis points of improvement year over year.
We expect fiscal year '25 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.15 to $6.20. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $9.98 to $10.03. We are raising our fiscal year '25 operating cash flow growth to approximately 24% to 26%, inclusive of cash tax headwinds. And we continue to expect capex for the fiscal year to be slightly below 2% of revenue.
This now results in free cash flow growth of approximately 26% to 28% for the fiscal year. Now to guidance for Q4. On revenue, we expect $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion, up 7% to 9% year over year in nominal and constant currency. cRPO growth for Q4 is expected to be approximately 9% year over year in nominal, including $100 million FX headwind, and slightly above 9% in constant currency.
Similar to Q3, we do not expect a material contribution to cRPO from Q4 Agentforce-related bookings. For Q4, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.55 to $1.60 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.57 to $2.62. In closing, I am very pleased with our strong execution this quarter and we remain focused on driving profitable growth, optimizing free cash flow, and delivering a new era of customer success with Agentforce, which truly represents the next evolution of Salesforce. Now, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.

Thanks, Amy. As a courtesy to everyone on the call, we ask that everyone only ask one question, please. With that, Regina, let's go to the first question, please.

Our first question will come from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Hi. Good afternoon, Marc. On Agentforce, I'm curious if you could just talk about the halo effect you're starting to see across the product lines, perhaps some of the other products getting pulled in. You mentioned Data Cloud, can you speak to what you're seeing from that? Thank you.
Marc Russell Benioff
--
Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Brent, thanks. That's a great question. And Amy really hit a very subtle line in the middle of her script and it probably requires a little more illumination, which is Amy really said to you that in our top-25 deals, we saw five, this kind of collaboration with these five clouds each. And what that means to us is that our top customers are really loading in this complete agent-first cocktail.
And this idea that we have sales, we have service, we have marketing, we have analytics, we have our data cloud, we have Slack and every customer wants these products and wants them together. You know, we have an incredible Sales Cloud, No. 1 in the world, you know that. And it is the only agent-first Sales Cloud today.
It's highly differentiated. We have the No. 1 Service Cloud in the world. Gartner just published the new Magic Quadrant.
We're No. 1 way up and to the right and guess what, we are now farther up into the right because we're the only agent-first Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Analytics, Data, Slack across the board. And I'll tell you a story, which is we have an incredible customer in the healthcare industry and they recently called me in there thinking about how are they going to deploy these agents and on and on and on, and it's a huge opportunity for healthcare, and I can talk to you exhaustively all about that. But we gave them the whole pitch, went through the whole thing, and then the next day they called us back and they said, we really want to talk to you now about our Marketing Cloud choice.
And we're looking at Adobe and how should we think about that? And I'm like, well, we really probably should bring in our team and show you what we're doing, but it's really you have to look at the whole platform that we can do because, yes, we have an incredible Marketing Cloud and incredible email capabilities and promotion capabilities and on and on and deeply integrated into our workflow. But take a look how it operates across all of your customer channels and all of your customer touchpoints and how this is one comprehensive customer suite and it's all agent-first and then he sent me a text and it's a very large customer and said, of course, we are going with you on the marketing as well. Because I think when customers realize that they are going to build agent-first companies the agent needs to have a comprehensive access to this entire dataset and metadata set that we are the only ones who have built this platform. Nobody else has a comprehensive platform that does sales, service, marketing, analytics, data cloud, Slack, all integrated together as one piece of code and operating across all languages, all currencies and can scale from the smallest companies to the very largest in the world.
And that is what is unique about Salesforce. And we have something very special right now because and you know Brent because you've been covering us for a long time, we always have the best enterprise AI and Einstein is the best. We've been working on that for more than a decade. So, of course, we were able to put it into overdrive and deliver agent-first.
But because it's within the platform, everything is in the platform. This isn't some distinct discrete piece of code, it's just another light switch on for the customer to get the full level of functionality. So, I couldn't be more excited about it. I'm sure it's coming through on the call.
I really think that for all of us, you think about, Brent, how long we've been working together for decades before I started at Salesforce and you think about the conversation we just had on this earnings call is unlike any conversation you and I have ever had about software. We are all about to learn and grow and expand and evolve and become a different kind of industry that's providing a different kind of value and this is the most excited I've ever been about the software industry.

Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and definitely hear the excitement coming through on the call. Maybe a question for Brian. When it comes to those 200 deals that you've already signed for Agentforce maybe you could give us some color on what those deals look like? Do they tend to be upsells? What type of uplift do you see if you're upselling into customers? Do they tend toward like one cloud or another? How expansive are they? Any kind of color that we can use to try to kind of understand this opportunity better?
Brian Millham
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, Keith, thank you for the question and a good one. We are seeing incredible traction with our customers as add-ons to many of our Service Cloud offerings. Obviously, you know Service Cloud is our largest cloud and our initial Agentforce opportunity is with our Service Cloud customers right now and we saw a ton of add-ons happening in our customer base with Service Cloud. But what our customers also recognize is that this is a platform.
And the opportunity to move from, yes, of course, we want to have autonomous agents that are supporting customers like we have on help.salesforce.com, but what are all the opportunities you have in your interactions and the flow of work with your customers where you can deploy agents. And so, while we have tremendous excitement in the initial 200 deals, we're largely in the Service Cloud space, we feel great about the opportunity with Sales Cloud and with Marketing Cloud and with Commerce Cloud and of course with Data Cloud, which is included in all of our Agentforce deals. And so, those 200 deals, sort of, tip of the iceberg when we think about the opportunity that's ahead of us for Agentforce.

Perfect. Thank you. You're obviously creating a lot of value for your clients. how is the discussion about how you kind of participate or work with the clients about pricing for Agentforce going or how should we think about it, what are you hearing there? Thank you.

President and Chief Operating Officer
Raimo, thanks for the question. I'll start and I think Marc is probably going to chime in as well. But we were super excited about it. And I would say, as you all know, it's a usage-based structure and at $2 a conversation, we feel like the value is very high for our customers given what they're spending today in a lot of their conversations, please.

Everybody knows I've been wearing a boot because I ruptured my Achilles while I was on a scuba diving trip to Fakarava, which is an incredible place in the Tuamotus in French Polynesia for my birthday, I was having a great time, ruptured my Achilles unfortunately, and I'm sure we all know the international motto of Fakarava, which I have close to my heart, which is I don't give a Fakarava. So, I think that I just got a call from my hospital telling me that I'm coming in to get scheduled for another MRI and incredible service. Everybody knows I have this great relationship with UCSF and they pay a lot of attention to me. I pay a lot of attention to them, incredible organization and they had a lot of questions for me about getting me ready for my next MRI.
And at the end of the call, it was kind of pre-operative care and there'll be another call post-operative and so forth. And I was just saying to myself, wow, what did that cost them? And they just don't have enough people as it is. Their doctors are already burned out, their nurses are burned out. I talk to the folks all the time.
There's a lot of pajama time for all these doctors is what they call it because they're all working late at night with their families, trying to get through all of their messages. Everybody is maxed out at UCSF. I mean, it's an incredible org, but I can't believe the amount that they have to do with such actually limited workforce. And then while I got this call, I said they kind of know all of this already about me.
They've got all of my data, they have all of my care, they have my family history. They've got all my scans. They can have an agent do this work and that call probably cost them $100. And it didn't have to happen.
And I think that we could have done the call for probably about $1.50. And I think that is the message to our customers, which is how are you going to give some of your people a break, let them get back to their strategic work, let them focus on what really matters to their customers and some of the work that's a little bit more administrative and bureaucratic and political that's done by these political layers or higher levels that's like, you know what, I think that could have happened with an agent. And that's kind of how I look at it. And I think we're just at an incredible moment where we can really grow our country's revenue, our GDP, and do a lot more, have a lot more productivity without hiring a lot more people.
And the hospital example is the best example. And consumption pricing isn't new to Salesforce. You all know that we have our sandboxes and our Commerce Cloud and Heroku and Data Cloud and many, many. But this is a consumption product.
We have per-user products, which are for humans. We have consumption products for agents and robots and that's how I think we should look at it, which is the comparative costs there's just no comparison. And do you want to add more to that, Brian?
Brian Millham
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, I'd just say, our customers really understand the cost of their labor right now. And when we can deploy agents to help them manage their interactions with their customers, the pricing conversations are significantly easier. And so, you can even see it on our website. We've got calculators that allow our customers to go do the work themselves and it's been a great ad for them to go understand what the cost structures look like and it's been an enlightenment for many of our customers to see the value that we can deliver for them with Agentforce.

Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brad Zelnick

Analyst
Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Marc, I wanted to ask about the More Core initiative that you mentioned in your remarks. It would seem further integrating the platform can only be a good thing for customers.
Can you talk more about what's involved and the size of the price as you come out the other side of this initiative? Thanks.
Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, we have been working on this now for a couple of years really since we started our transformation, which I think maybe this call is the two-year anniversary of our transformation. Is that right, Amy? I mean, it was about two years ago that we were like, whoa, we're about to go through an incredible transformation. And I think we would not have gotten through that transformation without the support of all of you. And I think you know that you gave us a lot of advice and thinking and strategy to do that and it's been an incredible 24 months.
It's been a financial transformation and it's been a technology transformation. And now, when we really think about what are the things that we really invested in, we really tried to look at how do we try to make our organization stronger to be able to deliver the numbers that we want to be able to do to, and we want to expand our distribution organization. That's something that we wish we had done faster and we're still not where we want to be there. I would say where we've made very significant investments were in AI and I think that's evidenced by Agentforce and we also made very significant investments in More Core.
We've dramatically increased not only the productivity, but also the number of engineers in the company over the last two years as well. That's been an incredible focus for us. That's why we're able to deliver this technology capability, and when we look at the company, I would say More Core has come out of it. So, at Dreamforce, you saw how commerce and marketing, for example, which always had been outside of the core platform are now inside the core platform.
And the idea that we want sales, service, marketing, analytics, data cloud, Slack, all to be in one platform. And that is because we want all the workflow, the data, the metadata, all to be in one platform. And the reason why is because the AI does not work if you don't have that. And the AI needs this ability to look across these huge datasets and capabilities to kind of pull it all together because you can imagine that I'm on the phone with UCSF and I'm talking now to the agent at some point in the future instead of talking to the person who I spoke to today and they say, you still owe $500 on that last visit, which is not uncommon for me, there's some additional fee or something that I have to pay.
And I'll say, yes, go ahead and process that and that's all just happens on our platform. So, commerce can happen on the platform, the confirming email can happen on the platform, the case management can happen on the platform, the patient relationship management can happen on the platform and it can happen by industry, it can happen by geography, it can happen by currency. And that is what's really, I think, unique about Salesforce. And it's not just that we're delivering this agent-first solution, it's the comprehensive functionality set underneath there that's all possible.

Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question here. I wanted to ask about the new foundations offering. This seems like a new strategic approach to multi-cloud packaging that could also drive broader agent adoption. What's been customer response to foundation so far? And do you have any sense on what adoption might look like in the coming year?
Marc Russell Benioff
--
Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
I think that foundation and when you look at other initiatives that we have and this is all coming out of More Core. So, when you look at essentials, when you look at our focus on the SMB market, when you look at kind of you're seeing the fundamental rewriting of the product in real time, it is a little bit like we are flying the airplane and rebuilding it in real time. I would joke with my team. Two years ago, what happened was we were flying the airplane.
We found out the two pilots were gone in the front and one person had the parachute jumped out of the plane and we were all left on the plane and we were on the phone with all of these going, well, we're going to put it all together and just trust us, we're going to get this done. And while we've been doing that not only did we land the plane successfully, but we rebuilt the whole airplane in real time. And that idea that the platform itself has been rebuilt. And it's pretty incredible.
Foundations is really a glimpse at what's happening. It's the same code set, but you can see how Foundations is kind of a whole different way to use Salesforce and we're making as much of our functionality available to all of our customers as possible. So, we're shipping Foundations so that every customer can get a taste of Sales and Service and Marketing and Analytics and Data Cloud and Slack. And everything that we have because we realize and I'll include one thing I didn't mention is platform.
So, it's very important that these customers see that they don't have to go buy another best-of-breed product, they can just flip the switch and everything comes on. And that is working and we still have a lot of work to do to educate our customers on all the capabilities that we have. Still, a lot of our Sales Cloud customers don't have Service Cloud and a lot of our Service Cloud customers don't have Sales Cloud and that's true of Marketing Cloud, I could go to each one of these clouds because in some ways, we've been selling a lot of these clouds in their own silos, so they've built on their own customer bases. And we have a lot of customers and we have a lot of software to sell to a lot of people.
But it's an exciting moment because we're so highly differentiated.

Our final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Kirk Materne

Analyst
Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter and great to hear all the excitement around Agentforce off the launch. Brian, this is probably for you. I was just curious and dovetails back into some earlier comments.
Really strong attach with Data Cloud thus far. I was just kind of curious how far along are your customers in terms of having their data in order so that they can get value from Agentforce somewhat out of the box? I'm just trying to get a better understanding of how long does it take from the conversation with customers and sort of scouting out what they're going to do, getting their data in order, and then bringing sort of Agentforce to bear, is it a three, six-month process? Just trying to get a sense if you have an idea on that quite yet. Thanks.
Brian Millham
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. It's a great question, Kirk, and I appreciate it. It varies by customer, honestly. If you've had a very strong data architecture strategy for many years, your ability to turn on Data Cloud, harmonize your data, and leverage it in our AI solutions is months and weeks even.
There are other customers who have data siloed across their business. They've built data lakes. It sits across different divisions that they want to bring together in Data Cloud and that can take a bit longer, six months even to bring that data together. They all want to move faster, which is a great opportunity for us.
They all recognize the need for harmonized data to make their AI and their Agentforce opportunity better with their customers. And so, what we're seeing is tremendous demand for not only the technology, but the people to go harmonize the data, get it in a state that they can now leverage Agentforce to really deliver for their customers. So, it really depends, honestly, is the answer.

Executive Vice President, Investor Relations
Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today on our fiscal 2025 fourth quarter results conference call. Our press release, SEC filings, and a replay of today's call can be found on our website. Joining me on the call today is Marc Benioff, chair and CEO; Amy Weaver, president and chief financial officer; Brian Millham, president and chief operating officer. In addition, we also have Robin Washington, our board member and incoming chief operating and financial officer here with us today.

Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, hey, thanks so much, Mike, and you know, I'm so excited about this call and reading the script with you because this was just the best quarter we've ever had. And I think you're going to see that as we kind of unfold what's happening here. And I'm sitting here with with Amy and Brian and Mike, and Sabastian is also on the table. And our new MOFO -- I mean, COFO, Robin Washington is here.
So, welcome, Robin. We're thrilled to have you here as well. And look, I'm really excited about this. I really think that we have something incredible to talk about.
And obviously, this was the quarter of Agentforce. We're going to talk about that. But it was really just another incredible quarter. And really, it's been another incredible year of growth and innovation.
I'm sure you all can see. We've had a really strong performance across all of our key metrics on revenue, on margin, EPS, cash flow, CRPO. We've passed some amazing milestones, including more than $60 billion in RPO. And this has been the highest cash flow in our company history.
You can see we exceeded our cash flow guidance. I think Amy did about 12.9 billion last quarter, but I think we delivered 13.1-ish. And that was just incredible for the quarter. And then, we're giving guidance.
I think it's around 14.5 billion in guidance for next year on the cash flow guidance. So, just awesome cash production. Few enterprise software companies have really ever delivered these kind of numbers and, I guess, only a couple have ever delivered guidance in the 40 billions, which is where we are. And our two newest major products are Data Cloud and Agentforce.
AI product line now, we can see, is a multi-billion dollar product line. So, we're excited to be, you know, in that kind of rarefied air of delivering a multi-billion dollar AI product line. We ended this year with 900 million in Data Cloud and AI ARR. It grew 120% year over year.
We've never seen products grow at these levels, especially Agentforce. And Data Cloud and AI Agentforce, this is now going to be incredible coming into fiscal year '26. As we begin this year and, well, since our founding, I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead. It's -- this is a moment like we've just never seen before.
And in just a few months, we've seen this addressable market go from hundreds of billions of dollars. And I'm sure you saw those ARC slides that got released over the weekend where she said that she thought this digital labor revolution, which is really kind of what we're in here now. This digital labor revolution, this looks like it's anywhere from a few trillion to 12 trillion. I mean, I kind of agree with her.
I think this is much, much bigger than software. I mean for the last 25 years we've been doing, you know, software to help our customers manage their data. That's very exciting. I think building software that kind of prints and deploys digital workers is more exciting, and you're going to hear some of these incredible stories in a second.
Our formula now really for our customers is this idea that we have these incredible Customer 360 apps. We have this incredible Data Cloud. You know, this -- this -- and this incredible agentic platform. These are the three layers.
But it's this -- that it is a deeply unified platform. It's a deeply unified platform. You know, it's just one piece of code. That's what makes it so unique in this market.
And that is why customers are having so great success with it. It's not a collection of disjointed parts you have to kind of self-assemble, DIY it, you know, all kinds of how do you get the security running, how do you do this, how do you do that. It's this idea that it's a deeply unified platform with one piece of code all wrapped in a beautiful layer of trust. And that's what gives Agentforce this incredible accuracy that we're seeing.
I'm going to talk about even what we've seen at Salesforce with that is amazing. And I'll tell you that our customers are just seeing some great success with it. And that's why just 90 days after it went live, we've already have 3,000 paying Agentforce customers who are experiencing unprecedented levels of productivity, efficiency, and cost savings. No one else is delivering at this level of capability, and we're really seeing a level of integration, simplicity, intelligence, power.
I mean, customers are really telling us that we're light years ahead of other providers, and their feedback really speaks volumes. So, exciting to go on the web and see Agentforce delivering labor for companies like Equinox, OpenTable, Jacuzzi, and others. I mean, I go to their sites. I'm going to their, you know, to their X feeds, their, you know, social media presence, and you see Agentforce running.
And look, a lot of other vendors are talking about their agent capabilities, but few are able to show that they've got this really running at scale. And as you're about to hear from Brian, we're seeing some amazing results on Salesforce as Customer Zero for Agentforce. Our digital labor force is resolving tens of thousands of customer service inquiries, you know, freeing our human employees to focus on the most nuanced issues and customer relationships. We're seeing tremendous momentum and success stories emerge as we execute our vision to make every company, every single company, every customer of ours an Agentforce company.
That is we want every customer to be an Agentforce customer. We want every trailblazer to be an agent blazer. And I want to share some of these amazing stories with you today. But first, let's hit a couple of these incredible numbers.
We closed out fiscal year '25 with 10 billion in revenue. That's amazing, our first 10 billion quarter. I remember, we had our first 10 billion year. Kind of amazing, 10 billion quarter, up 8% year over year, 9% in constant currency.
And I think we even lost, Amy, is that right, like a couple hundred million dollars in foreign exchange for the year as well. In Q4, we closed more than 400 deals over a million. All of our top 10 wins included data and AI. Brian, 400 deals over $1 million? Pretty awesome.
And we also continued phenomenal growth with Data Cloud this year, which is at the heart Agentforce. Data Cloud is the fuel that powers Agentforce and our customers are investing in it. And Data Cloud surpassed 50 trillion, that's trillion with a T, records, doubling year over year as customers increase their consumption and investment in our data platform. And that is just becoming critical and essential part of our solution.
Because as customers turn on AI and Agentforce, if they don't have the data -- we've been talking about this, I guess, for almost two years. If you don't have the data, you're not going to get the AI that you so badly want. And nearly, a quarter of those 50 trillion records, that's trillion with a T, were ingested from outside of Salesforce through our Zero Copy Partner Network, which is amazing. We'll see increased investments in software to build an agentic layer as AI continues to advance and handle a higher percentage of workloads, and we're taking advantage of the huge investments that these infrastructure companies.
We just -- you know, we'll work with -- of course, we have you know, two substrates, you know ,live, where we have Amazon, and we have Alibaba. You know, both companies are making huge investments in infrastructure. And the third one, Google is making a huge infrastructure investment. We're really getting great prices, you know, from these companies our deployment.
Our ability to deploy at a really low cost is just awesome. And it's just driving down our cost for our customers, so that's so exciting. Look, for the full year, we delivered 37.9 billion in revenue, It's up 9% year over year. Operating cash flow reaching 13.1 billion, up 28% year over year.
It's really one of the best performances I think of any software company. And with our continued disciplined approach to margin expansion, our non-GAAP operating margin closed at 33%. That was 250 basis points for fiscal year '25. I think it's 50 basis points higher than we even gave you guidance for a year ago.
Is that right, Amy? Yeah. And that's awesome. But we also passed an incredible milestone with more than 60 billion in RPO. That, I don't think we could have expected.
So, this is -- this milestone isn't just a number. It's a clear signal that our customers are trusting us, deploying us, getting great value from us, and continuing to invest in our vision for digital labor. I mean, I think it's going to be that digital labor vision, that revelation that we're able to provide digital labor at scale with this trinity of apps, data, and agents that is going to drive this fiscal year '26 success. We expect to deliver fiscal year '26 subscription and support revenue of 9% year over year in constant currency.
We remain deeply, deeply committed to profitable growth and expect fiscal year '26 non-GAAP operating margin of 34%. We're going to deliver another 100 basis points of expansion, following two years where we expanded more than 1,000 basis points. The pace of change; the focus on productivity, profitability; the speed of innovation, the trinity of apps, data, and agents, it's all coming together. As I mentioned, we're seeing customers deploy Agentforce across every industry.
Let's talk about a couple of examples. We've been working with Lennar, the nation's largest home builder. And most of you know, Lennar is really an incredible company. And they've been a customer of ours for about eight years.
They came to Dreamforce. And when they came to Dreamforce, they obviously got their hands like many of you did on Agentforce. Got super excited, went back to Miami, talked to their co-CEOs. You probably know Stuart Miller, Jon Jaffe, amazing CEOs.
And those co-CEOs called me and said, ""Listen, these guys have done a hackathon around Agentforce. We've got five use cases. We see incredible opportunities on our margin, incredible opportunities in our revenue. And do you have our back if we're going to deploy this?"" And we said, ""Absolutely, we deploy it ourselves,"" which is the best evidence that this is real.
And they are just incredible, their vision as a home builder, providing 24/7 support, sales leads through all their digital channels. They're able to sell all kinds of new products. I think they're going to sell mortgages and insurance and all kinds of things to their customers. And, you know, the cool thing is they're using our sales product, our service product, marketing, MuleSoft, Slack, Tableau, they use everything.
But they are able to leverage it all together by realizing that just by turning it on, they get this incredible Agentforce capability. All right, I want to tell you another story, not just about Lennar and transforming a home builder, but I don't know how many of you know about Pandora. You've been to a shopping center, you see the Pandora store. You walk in.
They have this gorgeous jewelry. They have these cool charm bracelets. They have amazing, amazing products. And, you know, their CEO, Alex, he's absolutely phenomenal.
I think he's based over in Amsterdam, or he's in the Netherlands. I can't remember where it is, but one of the northern European countries. Incredible CEO. Time actually just gave them an award as one of the most sustainable companies in the world.
Great company. You know, they're in 100 countries. They employ 37,000 people worldwide. And Alex has this great vision to augment their employees with digital labor.
And this idea that whether you're on their website or in their store or whatever it is that they're going to be able to do so much more with Agentforce. They already used -- first of all, they used Commerce Cloud. So, if you've been to pandora.com and bought their products and, you know, if you have it, by the way, it's completely worthwhile. It's great.
And you can experience our Commerce Cloud. But it's deeply integrated with our Service Cloud with Data Cloud. It's the one unified platform approach. And now, they're just flipping the switch, turning agents on, and they're planning to deliver 30% to 60% of their service cases with Agentforce.
That is awesome. And I really love Alex's vision of what's possible. And then, the last customer I really want to hit on, which I'm so excited about is Pfizer. And, you know, Albert is an incredible CEO.
They are doing unbelievable things. They've been a tremendous customer, but now they're really going all in on our Life Sciences Cloud. We're seeing so many, you know, I was in The Business Council last week in Washington, D.C., met with hundreds of CEOs. And so many of the CEOs of the life sciences industry are going with our Life Sciences Cloud.
It was incredible. And you can see why because it's just a natural upgrade of what they're already doing with us. And then, this idea that our Life Sciences Cloud becomes this highly differentiated capability from everything currently available in the market and then allows these pharma medtech companies, so many, to be able to streamline not just their clinical operations, all their customer-facing, even the ones who want to go to direct to consumer, even the ones who want to do clinical trials. And this idea that agents are going to make all of that so much better.
And with Agentforce sales agents, for example, with Pfizer, you know, that's -- they've got 20,000 customer-facing employees and customer-facing folks. You know, that is just a radical extension for them with agents. And I'll have to slot in one last one because I'll tell you, I'm sure a lot of you are like ""I have flown in Singapore Air. You know what, it's a great airline."" The CEO, Goh, is amazing.
And he has a huge vision that also came out of Dreamforce where they've already delivered the probably the best service of any airline in the world. They want to deliver it through agents. So, whether you're doing it with service or sales or marketing or commerce or all the different things that Singapore Air is doing with us, you're going to be able to do this right on Singapore Air. All right, well I know all of you want to see this in person, talk to these customers yourself.
You know you can go to help.salesforce.com. Brian's going to talk about that when you hear the numbers we delivered in the quarter there. You're not going to believe it. And listen, a lot of people say to me, ""Hey, how are you different from these other agent companies?"" Number one, go to those other vendors, go to their sites.
Are they running their ancient technology? You've all been on help.salesforce.com. You all know this incredible capability that we're delivering. You've seen it deployed by these other customers like Equinox and Remarkable and others. You've got your hands on it.
Do you see the other scaled vendors delivering this capability, or are they just using the word agent? I think you got to beware -- beware of the false agent because the false agent is out there where people can use the word agent or they kind of -- you know, they're trying to whitewash all the agent, the thing, everywhere. But the reality is there is the real agents and there are the false agents, and we're very fortunate to have the real stuff going on here. So, we've got a lot more groundbreaking AI innovation coming. I can't wait for you to see it at our TrailheadDX event next week, and that's going to be March 5th and 6th in San Francisco.
Looking forward to seeing all of you there and showing you that -- and I'll tell you, while you're there, and I didn't hit it, you've got to see this new product we've just built, which is Tableau Next. I'm sure a lot of you know Tableau. You probably use it every day. When you see what we have built, which is the new Tableau built with Agentforce on the Data Cloud and how it's deeply integrated into our product line, it is going to blow your mind.
It is incredible. You've got to make sure you get a demo of Tableau Next. You won't believe it, you're going to see the new Slack. You're going to see the new Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, the platform, Agentforce, all the products, this new field service product which is incredible.
You might get a glimpse of the new ITSM product that's coming if you look hard. But the big thing that I'm excited about, OK, the big thing that I'm really excited about is Tableau Next because that's about to deploy to customers at scale. And I think people are going to be absolutely blown away. All right, now, before I do that, I have to get out the Kleenex because I have to say goodbye to Brian and Amy, who, you know, it's kind of a moment in time here where Brian has been here for, I think, 25 years, 26 years.
He's just wearing one of the many watches that I've given him to recognize his performance. And Amy is here as well. She's not wearing one of her watches, but she has them at home probably in her jewelry case or safe or something. And, you know, Amy's -- how long has it been, Amy? Twelve years? Eleven years with Amy.
And, you know, we're going through a little bit of a transition of our management team between fiscal year '25 and '26, and we want to say goodbye and thank you. We want to say mahalo, and we want to say goodbye, which is a hui hou. And thank you so much for everything. And we're going to let them talk and also say their goodbyes.
But we're so grateful to everything that you've done for us every single day over the last 25 and 11 years, and it's been great to have you part of our management team, and you're welcome back any time. So, if you get lonely out there on the golf course or -- I know Amy's got some big plans that she's not ready to announce yet in the NGO world. But I'll tell you that, you know, if you guys get lonely or you're missing the thrill of the hunt, come back and see us because we're going to be ready for you to come back. OK.

I really appreciate it. It's been a privilege of a lifetime to work here for more than 25 years. Very few people get to start at a company that has zero revenue and helps it grow to 38 billion. The journey has been remarkable, and this year was certainly the capstone.
As you heard from Mark, in just one quarter, Agentforce has been deployed by thousands of brands worldwide, becoming an incredible lever for productivity, growth, and efficiency. It's happened faster than we ever expected. With our deeply unified platform seamlessly integrating our Customer 360 apps, Data Cloud, and Agentforce, we're leading the digital labor revolution. Customers of every size across every industry are seeing immediate and substantial value with Agentforce.
We're setting new standards in the industry. OpenTable is a great example of how Agentforce is having an immediate impact. In just three weeks, it's handling 73% of all restaurant web queries, a 50% improvement over their previous tool. And they're not alone.
The Futurum Group surveyed customers and found that Agentforce can achieve ROI fast five times faster than DIY while lowering costs by 20%. And technology analyst firm, Valoir, found Agentforce delivers autonomous AI agents 16 times faster versus DIY approaches with 75% increased accuracy. We continue to see significant increase in large multi-cloud transactions as companies look to accelerate faster time to value, efficiency, and growth. Goodyear is partnering with us on their transformation, using Agentforce to automate and increase the effectiveness of their sales efforts.
With Agentforce for field service, Goodyear. will be able to reduce repair time by assisting technicians with answers to vehicle-related questions and autonomously scheduling field tech appointments. We also continue to embed an agentic layer across our own business. Today, we're live on Agentforce across service and sales, our business technology organization, customer support, and more, and the results are phenomenal.
Since launching on our Salesforce help portal in October, Agentforce has autonomously handled 380,000 service requests, achieving an incredible 84% resolution rate. And only 2% of the requests require human escalation. And we're using Agentforce for quoting, accelerating our quoting cycles by more than 75%. In Q4, We increased our AE capacity while still driving productivity, up 7% year over year.
Agentforce is transforming how we do outbound prospecting, already engaging more than 50 leads per day, with personalized outreach and timely follow-ups, freeing up our teams to focus on high-value conversation. Our reps are participating in thousands of sales coaching training sessions each month. Data Cloud has a powerful network effect. As usage expands, the platform becomes more intelligent and more valuable.
And that's why we're seeing companies around the world, including Maserati, Bell Canada, Dolce Gabbana, continue to invest in Data Cloud and to build the foundation to implement agents at scale. CaixaBank, which happens to be Spain's leading bank, is using Data Cloud to create a robust data infrastructure that supports its agentic transformation and enables them to drive faster and more consistent customer experiences. As you know, the true value of AI is in the data. Nearly half of the Fortune 100 are both AI and Data Cloud customers.
And all of our top 10 wins in Q4 included Data Cloud and AI. Agentforce revolutionized revolutionizing how our customers work by bringing AI-powered insights and actions directly into the workflows across the Customer 360 applications. This is driving strong growth across our portfolio. Sales Cloud and Service Cloud both achieved double-digit growth again in Q4.
We're seeing fantastic momentum with Slack with customers like ZoomInfo, Remarkable, and MIMIT Health using Agentforce and Slack to boost productivity. Once again, Slack was included in over a third of our deals over $1 million, and its contribution to the overall deal size increased double digits year over year. With nearly 5 billion messages sent weekly, Slack is central to how people work going forward. We're confident Slack will be the place where every company brings digital labor to all of their employees, enabling collaboration with Agentforce to get work done.
Tableau and MuleSoft are mission critical to our customers with each featured in nearly half of our greater than $1 million deals. Tableau, now integrated with Data Cloud and Agentforce on the Salesforce core platform will transform how customers like EchoStar, Goosehead Insurance, and Keller Williams Realty take action on their data. Customers can now unlock actionable insights from conversational analytics, manage and analyze data using AI assistance, and build analytical agents with integrated workflows. Similarly, MuleSoft is transforming how industry leaders like Banco Bradesco, Fujitsu and Sony Honda Mobility approach enterprise integration.
With agent-driven integration and out-of-the-box connectors for every major system, customers simply describe their needs in natural language, and our AI automatically builds the solution. Agentforce is also enabling us to deliver truly transformative solutions for every industry and region. In Q4, nearly half of our top 100 wins were international, including wins with companies like One New Zealand, LG Electronics and Versace. Our industry business, along with public sector and dot-org finished the year at an incredible 5.7 billion in ARR, up 20% year over year.
All of our top 10 deals and nearly 75% of our top 100 deals included industry cloud. To meet this demand, we pre-built over 170 specialized Agentforce industry skills and a team of 400 specialists supporting transformations across sectors and geographies. Our new channels and partner ecosystem, anchored by our amazing -- sorry, 19 million trailblazers are unlocking customer spend and driving Agentforce adoption. And we're leaning into our ecosystem.
In fact, partners were involved in 50% of our Agentforce wins and 70% of our Agentforce activations in Q4. We're also working with our partners to become Agentforce companies themselves. Accenture is using Agentforce Sales Coach, which provides personalized coaching and recommendations for sales teams, which is expected to lead to higher win rates. And Deloitte is projecting significant productivity gains and save workforce hours as they roll out Agentforce over the next few years.
Over 127,000 system integrated employees have completed Agentforce training, and more than a thousand ISE and technology partners are building and selling agents. Our Agentforce Partner Network allows customers to deploy prebuilt agents and use agent actions from partners like AWS, Google, IBM, Workday, and more. Earlier this week, we announced an expanded partnership with Google, as Marc mentioned, to empower customers to use Agentforce with Gemini, their multimodal model, and to deploy Salesforce on Google Cloud. AWS is a huge growth engine for us, helping us close a number of large deals.
In fact, in Q4, we closed 25 transactions over $1 million, including three that were more than 10 million. We're starting off FY '26 in an incredible position with a highly accomplished and technical leadership team ready to guide us through this pivotal moment in AI and agents. I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity and to all the leaders who have gotten us here, especially Marc and Amy. It's been an honor to work alongside both of you.
Thank you to our employees, customers, partners, and shareholders. I couldn't be more proud of what we've accomplished or more excited about what's ahead for Salesforce. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Amy.

President and Chief Financial Officer
Great. Thanks, Brian. I wanted to start also by expressing my gratitude to Marc and Brian for their partnership and for their deep friendship over many, many years. It's been an incredible journey, and I'm truly thankful for the opportunity.
I am also absolutely thrilled to welcome Robin to the team as our new chief operating and financial officer. Fiscal year '25 was a year of incredible change, with new innovation beyond anything we could have expected just 12 months ago, requiring persistence and urgency in our execution. Q4 is a reflection of that focus across the business, and you can see it in our results. Let's start with revenue.
For the full year, revenue was 37.9 billion, up 9% year over year in both nominal and constant currency. Subscription and support revenue grew just over 10% in constant currency. Q4 revenue was 10 billion, up 8% year over year in nominal. This includes approximately 75 million of incremental FX headwinds since our last guidance, resulting in 9% growth year over year in constant currency.
Subscription and support revenue grew 9% year over year in constant, driven by stability in sales, service, and platform, partially offset by MuleSoft and Tableau who had very tough prior-year compares. From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue grew 8% in nominal and constant currency. EMEA grew 6%, or 7% in constant currency. And APAC grew 10%, or 14% in constant currency.
We saw strong new business growth in Latam, Japan, and Canada, while parts of EMEA remain constrained. Of note, the United States saw some stabilization in the quarter. From an industry perspective, in Q4, health and life sciences, communications and media both performed well, while tech and manufacturing, automotive and energy were more measured. And as you heard from Brian, our multi-cloud momentum continues as customers turn to our deeply unified platform.
That's why our top 100 deals in the quarter averaged six clouds. And all of our top 10 wins included AI, Data Cloud, service, platform, and industry clouds. Our data and AI momentum continues as we move toward a world where AI is ubiquitous and embedded in everyday workflows. Our investments in this space have been deliberate and focused, and we are now starting to yield strong returns.
In the -- we ended the year with 900 million in Data Cloud and AI annual recurring revenue, growing nearly 120% year over year. As Marc shared, we closed more than 3,000 paid Agentforce deals in the quarter. As customers continue to harness the value of AI deeply embedded across our unified platform, it is no surprise that these customers averaged nearly four clouds. And these customers came from a diverse set of industries with more than half in technology, manufacturing, financial services, and HLS.
Q4 revenue attrition ended the quarter slightly above 8%, in line with recent quarters. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%, up 170 basis points year over year, driven by top-line outperformance and disciplined expense management. GAAP operating margin was 18.2%, up 70 basis points year over year. And for the full year, I am very pleased with our non-GAAP operating margin of 33%, up another 250 basis points year over year.
GAAP operating margin was 19%, up 460 basis points year over year, inclusive of incremental restructuring charges we incurred in Q4. Q4 operating cash flow was nearly 4 billion, up 17% year over year. Q4 free cash flow was 3.8 billion, also up 17% year over year. And for the full year, operating cash flow was a record 13.1 billion, up 28% year over year.
And that's inclusive of a predicted 10-point cash tax headwind. And as we said, driving strong free cash flow remains a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Fiscal year '25 free cash flow was 12.4 billion, up 31% year over year. Turning to remaining performance obligations, RPO, which represents all future revenue under contract, we passed 60 billion for the first time in company history.
Q4 finished at an incredible 63.4 billion, up 11% year over year, representing our customers long-term commitment to Salesforce and the durability of our business model. Current RPO, or CRPO, ended at 30.2 billion, an increase of 9% year over year in nominal currency. This includes a $300 million FX headwind which resulted in 11% year-over-year growth in constant currency, driven by strong performance in Data Cloud and AI and Slack. Q4 CRPO also benefited significantly from strong early renewals.
Within our bookings this quarter, we again saw continued stabilization in our transactional businesses, including Create and Close and SMB. On capital return, in fiscal '25, we executed 7.8 billion in share repurchases and issued 1.5 billion in dividends. Through our capital return program, we more than fully offset dilution from FY '25 stock-based compensation. And since the inception of our capital return program, we have now returned more than 21 billion to shareholders.
Now, let's turn to guidance. Starting with full fiscal year '26, we expect revenue of 40.5 billion to 40.9 billion, growth of approximately 7% to 8% year over year in nominal and constant currency. And for subscription and support revenue, we expect growth of approximately 9% year over year in constant currency. Now, I want to pause and give a few important notes on this guidance.
First, on foreign exchange, as Marc noted, we've seen the U.S. dollar strengthen considerably. And even since our last earnings call, that movement has driven an incremental $200 million headwind to fiscal '26 revenue. Our revenue guidance now incorporates an approximately 0.5 point year-over-year headwind.
Second, as we experienced in fiscal '25, we continue to expect our professional services business to be a headwind to growth this year, which is reflected in our guidance for total revenue. Know that as part of our overall implementation strategy, we are leaning more on our partner ecosystem. As you heard from Brian, partners were involved in 50% of our Agentforce wins and 70% of Agentforce activations in Q4. Third, we expect subscription and support revenue to be lifted by momentum in Data Cloud and some contribution from Agentforce this year, partially offset by weakness in marketing and commerce, and slower growth in our exploration base in FY '26.
Finally, on Agentforce, we are incredibly excited about the customer momentum we are seeing. However, the adoption cycle is still early as we focus on deployment with our customers. As a result, we are assuming a modest contribution to revenue in fiscal '26. We expect the momentum to build throughout the year, driving a more meaningful contribution in fiscal '27.
And on attrition, we expect attrition to remain consistent and slightly above 8% for the full year. Now, turning to profitability and cash flow. On margins, I want to reiterate that the company remains committed to ongoing expansion. The company has laid a strong foundation for continued margin progression, efficiency, and disciplined investments.
Fiscal year '26 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 34%, representing another 100 basis points of expansion year over year. This incorporates intentional investments in high-growth opportunities, most notably in Agentforce and Data Cloud. And I'd like to call out that from a pace perspective, we do expect a ramp in margins throughout the year. Stock-based compensation is expected to stay relatively flat year over year as a percent of revenue.
We expect fiscal year '26 GAAP operating margin of 21.6%, representing more than 250 basis points of improvement year over year. We expect fiscal year '26 GAAP diluted EPS of $6.95 to $7.03. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $11.09 to $11.17. As we've mentioned over the last few years, we remain focused on driving durable cash flow growth.
We expect fiscal year '26 operating cash flow growth of approximately 10% to 11%, and we are not expecting a material headwind from cash taxes this year. We expect capex for the fiscal year to be approximately 2% of revenue again. This results in free cash flow growth of approximately 9% to 10% for the fiscal year. Now, to guidance for Q1.
On revenue, we expect 9.71 billion to 9.76 billion, up 6% to 7% year over year in nominal and 7% in constant currency. As a reminder, we are lapping the 1 point leap year benefit we noted last Q1, as well as the benefit from license revenue timing. CRPO growth for Q1 is expected to be approximately 10% year over year in nominal, including a $100 million FX headwind, resulting in slightly above 10% in constant currency. For Q1, we expect GAAP EPS of $1.49 to $1.51 and non-GAAP EPS of $2.53 to $2.55.
In closing, I'm very pleased with our strong finish to the year and the foundation we have set in place for continued success, and I want to thank our employees for their dedication and execution throughout the year. I also want to extend my gratitude to our shareholder and investment community for your continued support. It has really been a privilege working with all of you. Now, Mike, do you want to open up the call for questions?

Sure thing. So, congratulations on the very strong quarter, a lot of focus on Agentforce and a lot of big numbers there. Investors are asking me a lot of questions about the changing pricing model dynamics, going from a seat-based model to one that includes consumptive elements and how that nets out. So, I was wondering if you can give us some color in terms of what you guys are seeing thus far when you're doing these Agentforce contracts.
Is it expanding the overall contract size? What kind of expansions are you seeing if you are seeing expansions? And does the math net to be a good positive for Salesforce as we move to a more consumptive model? Are there any bumps in the road that we should be aware of?
Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
OK, well, I'd love to address that directly and then I'm going to ask Brian to come in with some specifics and examples because I think it's so exciting. You know, I think -- of course, you know, we've kind of started the company out with the per-user pricing model, and, you know, that's about humans. We price per human. So, you -- kind of pricing per human.
And then, we have products that are also in the consumption world as well. And, of course, those started in the early days, things like our sandboxes. You know, even things like our Commerce Cloud, even our email marketing product, our Marketing Cloud. You know, these are consumption-based products we've had for years.
And it's always been a mix of, you know, products that we have for humans and then products that we have for computers. Now, we have, you know these kind of products that are for agents also. And agents are also a consumption model. So, when we look at our Data Cloud, for example, that's a consumption product.
Agentforce is a consumption product. But it's going to be a mix. It's going to be a mix between what's going on with our customers with how many humans do they have and then how many agents are they deploying. I think in one example that I can personally tell you about in the quarter, you know, we did a large transaction with a large telecommunications company.
It's incredible. And when I was talking to their CEO, she was asking me how are we going to price the transaction and so forth. And I can't remember the exact number of the deal. I think it was -- Brian, maybe it was about $20 million in ACV, something like that for the year, maybe $60 million TCV transaction.
And then, as part of that transaction, it's a mix of, you know, we're rebuilding this telecommunications company. So, it's Sales Cloud, it's Service Cloud, it's Marketing Cloud, it's all of our core clouds. But then, also, it's Agentforce. And the Agentforce component, I think, was maybe $7 million in the transaction.
So, she was buying $7 million of Agentforce. She bought $13 million in our products for humans. And I think that was about 20 million in total. These are about approximate numbers.
I think that's kind of the idea that you're going to see us be able to deliver, you know, the right package for the right customer. Even if you look at Salesforce, as I mentioned, here we are, you know, working in this world, and kind of Brian has hit on it, we did what, 360,000 transactions in the quarter with Agentforce, you know, in help.salesforce.com.
Brian Millham

President and Chief Operating Officer
Three hundred eighty.
Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Three hundred eighty. And then, what do you have, about, you know, several thousand, you know, customer support reps? And so, we have our Service Cloud running, we have Agentforce running, we have our different products running. Then, our -- of course, our Service Cloud is deeply integrated with our service -- Sales Cloud and other products. So, it's going to be a mix.
And I think that the mix is the most exciting thing. I don't know any company that's 100% agents. I don't know of any company that doesn't need automation for its humans. I don't know any company that doesn't need a data cloud where it needs a consistent common data repository for all of its agents to gain their intelligence.
And I don't know any company that's not going to need an agentic layer. And that idea of having apps, data, and agents, I think, is going to be the winning combination. You want to actually give the real details, Brian?
Brian Millham
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
No, that's exactly right. This trinity, as you called it, Marc, CRM plus data plus agents is really what our customers are coming to us for. Our objective is how do we serve the customers and focus on customer success, how do we give them what they need to go drive their business forward, both from a productivity and from an efficiency perspective. The pricing models will change over time.
There's no doubt about it. The nice thing that we've seen with our customers is they really understand the ROI associated with digital labor. What we're able to provide with agents is really driving the velocity of transactions that we've seen. Marc mentioned the 3,000 transactions that we closed in the fourth quarter, really driven on our ROI model that people understand that they can get a tremendous amount of benefit from agents.
We will probably move into the near future from conversations as we price most of our initial deals to universal credit that will allow our customers far more flexibility in the way they transact with us. But we see this as significantly upside to our pricing structures going forward. And that's what we've seen in the early days with our engagement with customers.

To correctly address, like, here's a transaction that you're doing. Let's say a customer comes in, they're very interested in building an agentic layer on their company. You know, is that bringing other human-based clouds along with it?
Brian Millham
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
No doubt. And I think what we've seen is that we have incremental strength in our core technology, the CRM core technology. You saw in the quarter, we had some good performance, both Sales and Service Cloud, both above 10% growth in the quarter. And so, we are seeing people leverage our core technology, the named pricing models with our core apps and agents together to go drive the efficiencies that they're looking for.
Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Yep, I think you're going to really play it out. And when you do come to TrailheaDX and you do see that new Tableau Next, I think what you're going to see is a Tableau that was only built for humans before but now is deeply integrated into Data Cloud and has a deep agentic layer as well. So, you're going to be able to come to your own conclusions, get your hands on these products, talk to the customers. What an exciting moment.

OK. Thanks, Keith. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne

Hi. Yes, thanks very much for taking the question. Brian and Marc, I was wondering if you just talk about -- you referred to it a little bit, but, you know, as Agentforce builds, obviously, not every company is going to be ready to potentially go agentic today. But is Agentforce having a bit of a halo effect around some of your other products? Meaning as we are on the journey to get more monetization from Agentforce, are you seeing pickups or at least higher activity levels in some of your other products that, you know, Brian, to your point, you know, sort of form this holy trinity? Thanks.
Brian Millham
--
President and Chief Operating Officer
You're exactly right. And we're seeing it in the way that our customers are using our technology, new ideas, new workflows, new engagements. We talked about Lennar as an example. Their ability to handle leads after hours that they weren't able to get back to or respond to in a quick time frame are now able to touch and engage with those leads.
And then, that, of course, flows into Salesforce automation system. And so, we are seeing this halo effect with our core technology. It is making every single one of our core apps better as they deliver intelligence underpinning these applications. And so, it is the message that we're delivering this trinity of apps, data, and agents that are -- is really compelling to our customers.

Hey, perfect. Congrats from me as well. And Marc, like, with Amy and Brian, you lose some very experienced people on the team. What was the thinking in terms of combining those two roles? And how do you see that playing out going forward? Thank you.
Marc Russell Benioff

Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I'm so excited, you know, to have Robin come in as our new COFO. And I really think it's exciting because Robin really has this kind of unique capability to deliver the chief operating officer position and chief financial officer position. And I'll tell you, as we did the search, one of the really top candidates that we saw come through held this position in another company. And I think as Robin and I were talking about that, you know, the leverage of having a COFO, this idea that the financial officer and the chief operating officer really come together as this incredible, you know, partnership to deliver, you know, this capability.
It just was a perfect match for us. I was thinking about going with it on the -- with this outside candidate, and that's where I was fortunate to be able to convince Robin to take the job. And, Robin, would you like to just say something and just kind of come in here and just tell us about how excited you are to be part of the management team?
Robin Washington

Board Member and Incoming Chief Operating and Financial Officer
Sure, Marc. As you've heard Brian, Amy, and Marc talk about it, it is an exciting opportunity for us right now with Agentforce, so I am elated to be able to join forces with the operating team. It's an exciting time in our industry as well. And as you've heard us talk about the trinity and our deeply unified platform, I think we clearly are able to have something that's going to support our customers' growth and productivity in this new area -- in this new era, I should say, with the result of sustainable and profitable revenue growth for Salesforce long term.
Marc Russell Benioff
--
Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And I just want to also -- I should also really thank -- Miguel Milano, as you probably know, came back as our chief revenue officer about a year ago. And, you know, he decided to rejoin us after some cajoling. And I've asked him to work directly for me, you know, running our worldwide sales organization.
And so, I've been so thrilled about that. And I also have to thank Srini, who was our chief engineering officer, who's now our chief engineering and services officer who's taken on customer service and support. And it's been a rebalancing of our management team. So, we have this amazing new executive with Robin.
I couldn't be more excited to have her by my side. And just as a little side note, Robin will tell you, I've been trying to convince her to join the company for over a decade. And so, I finally got her and after a lot of selling. So, we're thrilled to have Robin with us and joining us, you know, at direct operating executive from the board.
And then, having Miguel is so exciting. Of course, having Parker with me as well is so critical. And also, as I mentioned, Srini is running services and engineering, and Steve Fisher, being promoted recently to our chief product officer -- or actually, our chief technology officer, running products; and our chief product officer, David Schmaier, also with expanded responsibilities working directly for me. David is now our chief product and impact officer.
And this is -- I couldn't be more thrilled. I also have a great chief of staff, Kendall, and a whole team around me with so many incredible functions and capabilities. And, of course, smiling and waving at me across the table is Sabastian Niles, my chief legal officer, who has done an unbelievable job since joining the company. So, I don't think I've ever had a better management team.
I mean, it's hard to beat Amy and Brian, but I think maybe we did it. We're really thrilled. So, sorry, Amy and Brian, to see you go, a hui ho, but welcome to the new management team. And we're so thrilled to have them with us, and we're so excited to start fiscal year '26 with an absolute bang.
And, Robin, did you want to end with any parting comments?

Thanks. Marc, just on DOGE and the impact of what the federal and state has been. I'm curious if you could discuss your role and what you think this means for Salesforce.
Marc Russell Benioff
--
Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't have any role. I'm -- you know, I think I'm -- you know, of course, I'm coming at this with a beginner's mind like I'm sure all of us are that, you know, we want to see what they are able to deliver with the new administration or -- you know, huge fans of the United States of America. We want us to be a successful country as we possibly can be. And that also includes having something that I think is critically important for us, which is a balanced budget, something I've, you know, encouraged every president that I've worked with for, you know, quite a few administrations to achieve.
We're thrilled with our relationship with the government. You know that we have so many agencies that depend on us from providing support for veterans through our Veterans Administration and so many other groups. And I think even DOGE is using Slack to manage their communication and coordination. So, you know, we'll work closely with the government.
We'll do anything we can to help them succeed. And we wish them only the best, and we're here to help at every step of the way. And we want the U.S. to be, you know, as successful as it possibly can.

Mark Murphy

Analyst
Thank you so much. Marc, you had mentioned this labor arbitrage and that jobs are going to evolve. When you think through the scale of that kind of an opportunity, how much labor do you think you can augment or replace? For instance, you know, could a company with a thousand employees slow its hiring or stop hiring and, you know, just layer in a couple hundred agents for spots and maybe accelerate its growth. And then, you know, further to Brent's point, can we apply that concept to federal government agencies? If they have 3 million workers and some of them are going to leave voluntarily, could they layer in, you know, hundreds of thousands of these Agentforce bots and see some greater efficiency?
Marc Russell Benioff
--
Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think that, you know, I could wave you away and say I don't really know yet. But I will tell you that since I'm the CEO of a 75,000-person company -- or how many employees do we have now? Seventy-five, 76,000. So, you know, let's just look at us. You know, so we have, what, 9,000 support agents.
We really are seeing tremendous efficiency with help.salesforce.com, so we may see the opportunity to rebalance some of those folks into sales and marketing and other functions. We're really excited about that. I would say that we're definitely have seen a lot of efficiency with engineering and with some of the new tools that I've seen, especially some of these high-performance coding tools. One of the key members of my staff who's here in the room with us just showed me one of his new, you know, examples of what we're able to do with these coding tools.
It's pretty awesome. And we're not going to hire any new engineers this year. We're seeing 30% productivity increase on engineering, and we're going to really continue to ride that up. And we're going to grow sales pretty dramatically this year.
Brian has got a big vision for how to grow the sales organization probably another 10% to 20%, I hope, this year because we're seeing incredible levels of demand. I think every company who is our customer or prospect wants us to come in and start talking about what we're going to do with them and how we're going to transform them. Everybody sees the opportunity. I think that, you know, the big message I have for a lot of CEOs that I meet with is, ""Hey, you know, we're the last generation of CEOs to only manage humans."" You know, I think every CEO going forward is going to manage, you know, humans and agents together.
I know that's what I'm doing. So, this is what I have to think about every single day as a CEO. And I think everyone is going to have to start to think about that. It's definitely starting because as I mentioned, I was with a large CEO group last week, and it was a topic of conversation in every single person that I met with, and with whether it's those life sciences CEOs that we mentioned or financial services CEOs or manufacturing CEOs.
And every example, they can see how agents are going to be able to augment their workforce. And I think you can see it also in the global economy that, I think, productivity is going to rise without additions to more human labor, which is good because human labor is not increasing in the global workforce. So, you have a stagnant human workforce worldwide. So, if you want productivity to go up, and you want GDP to grow up, and you want growth, I think that digital labor is going to be one of the catalysts to make that happen.
And I was talking with a significant economist and economic leader last week. And I think that, you know, they -- I think everyone's on the same page that we could see something really dramatic. And this is our main focus as a company. We aren't, you know, building huge, you know, $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion, $100 billion data centers.
We're not, you know, doing some of these kind of engineering efforts that may or may not have some kind of huge payoff but is going to take down all of our cash and all of our margin for the next several years. We're like augmenting our existing product line with artificial intelligence, taking advantage of these incredible investments that are being made, you know, in infrastructure by others. And we're going to deliver the digital labor revolution. This is our goal.
Our goal is to be the No. 1 provider of digital labor in the world. That's it. I don't think there really is another goal.
You know, you can say we're the No. 1 AI CRM, which we already are. But when you're the No. 1 AI CRM, you're also going to lead the digital labor revolution.
And that is going to be the focus of fiscal year '26. As I said, this is the year of digital labor, and it is going to be the year where every trailblazer is going to become an agent blazer.

Great. Thanks. Operator, we'll take our last question now, please.

And that question comes from Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.
Kash Rangan

Analyst
Hey, thank you very much. We'll miss you, Brian and Amy. Congratulations, Robin. One for you, Marc.
There's a lot of talk about how we're moving from model building and training to the inference layer. And also, as part of that shift to agentic technology, there's been a lot of debate about the SaaS technology and the business model. Can the SaaS tech stack that you built and pioneered, how does that fit into the agentic world? Is there a risk that SaaS just becomes a CRUD database? I know it sounds really terrible, but I'm sure you have an opinion. I'd love to hear it.
Thank you.
Marc Russell Benioff
--
Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer
OK, well, Kash, I really appreciate that. And, you know, look, I've heard that Microsoft narrative, too. So, you know, I watched the podcast you watched, and that's a very interesting idea. You know, here's the -- here's how I look at it, which is I believe there is kind of a holy trinity here of AI CRM, which is the apps, the data, and the agents.
And these three things have to kind of work together. And I kind of put my money where our mouth is where we kind of built it and we delivered it. And you can see the 380,000, you know, conversations that we had as point of evidence here in the last 90 days on our service and with a very high resolution rate of 84%. Now, you can go to our -- you can go to help.salesforce.com and you can see that today.
Now, Microsoft has had Copilot available for, I think, about two years or more than two years, and they are -- I know that they're the reseller of OpenAI and they've invested their -- kind of repackaged this, you know, ChatGPT or whatever. But where on their site are they delivering agents? Where in their company have they done this? Where -- are they a best practice? Because I think that while they can say such a thing, do they have humans and agents working together to create customer success? Are they rebalancing their workforce with humans and agents? I think that it's a very interesting point that, yes, the agentic layer is very important, but it doesn't operate by itself. It operates with data with a data cloud that has to be federated through your company to all your data sources. And humans, we're still here.
I'm here. I just knocked on the table. In case anybody wants to know, this is not an agent. And I mean, I guess we're not very long, is that actually going to be a good test? But just know that I am here, and you could call me or text me, Kash.
And, you know, I am using those apps, too. Like I said I've got -- the new Tableau is amazing, the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud I use. I use all of our products. Slack, I was just on.
And that idea that our apps and our Data Cloud and our agentic layer, all integrated deliver -- integrated together right now and delivering value right now to our No. 1 Customer Zero, Salesforce. Wow, here we go. And are other vendors really doing that? Beware of the false agent.
Go out there and take a look who's really talking about it and who's really delivering. And this is a lot of engineering that has to get done to make this really work for a large enterprise like us. And Salesforce has done it. We are the No.
1 AI CRM. We are the leader of the digital labor revolution. You can see it now with over 3,000 paid customers. And as you can see, you know, the tens of trillions of transactions that happen in our Data Cloud, incredible.
So, thank you very much for a great fiscal year '25. Thank you to Amy and Brian. It's amazing. And welcome to Robin onto the management team.
And to all of our new executives, congratulations on their promotions. And we're ready for a great fiscal year '26. This is going to be the absolute year of Agentforce.

Operator
Welcome to Cisco's first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial results conference call. At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now, I would like to introduce Sami Badri, head of investor relations.
Sir, you may begin.
Sami Badri
--
Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance
Good afternoon, everyone. This is Sami Badri, Cisco's head of investor relations, joined by Chuck Robbins, our chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Cisco's earnings press release and supplemental information, including GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Investor Relations website. Following this call, we will also make the recorded webcast and slides available on the website.
Throughout today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We will discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders unless stated otherwise. All comparisons will be made on a year-over-year basis. Please note that our discussions today will include forward-looking statements, including our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings particularly our most recent 10-K report, which identifies important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call further -- for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. Now, I'll turn it over to Chuck.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. Cisco delivered a strong start to fiscal '25, delivering $13.8 billion in revenue for the first quarter, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. This was supported by solid growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations, and subscription revenue, which now accounts for 57% of our total revenue. The strength of our recurring revenue streams is helping to fuel our profitability.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 exceeded the high end of our guidance range, driven by the highest non-GAAP gross margin we have seen in more than 20 years, which was further enhanced by Splunk. The combination of Cisco and Splunk and our team's great execution are both driving our strong operating leverage. The strength of our operating performance and free cash flow in Q1 fueled a return of $3.6 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, delivering on our commitment to consistent capital returns. Building on the growing demand we saw at the end of fiscal year '24, product orders grew 20% year over year in Q1 and were up 9% organically.
This is an acceleration of the 14% product order growth we saw just three months ago and is a clear sign of normalizing demand for Cisco's innovation. Now, let me share some details on our first quarter, starting with the demand environment. Enterprise product orders were up 33%, driven by a particularly strong performance in the Americas and EMEA across a broad range of customers. We saw continued strong momentum in service provider and cloud with product orders up 28%, driven by triple-digit growth in web scale.
In Q1, our web scale customers placed AI infrastructure orders in excess of $300 million. Our AI pipeline continues to be strong. We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers. After a very strong Q4 last quarter, public sector orders were up 2% year over year in Q1.
Federal spending in the U.S. was lower year over year due to continuing resolutions discussions, the impact of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the diversion of funds within U.S. Federal. It's important to note that we believe the deals we are working on with U.S.
Federal customers are simply delayed, not lost. In both EMEA and APJC year-over-year public sector order growth was strong. Now, let me share some data on demand through the lens of our products to provide some incremental color. Our networking portfolio saw double-digit product order growth overall driven by switching, wireless, and Internet infrastructure.
Looking at data center switching in particular, we have seen three consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth and an acceleration from Q4 into Q1. This shows our competitive strength in this key market and the power of our Nexus brand and the build-out of private cloud infrastructure by our customers. We expect this momentum to continue as customers are showing significant interest in our 400-gig and 800-gig switches based on Silicon One. Security orders more than doubled year over year, driven by the advanced threat intelligence capabilities of Splunk.
Excluding Splunk, growth in security product orders was driven by our renewed security strategy and new product pipeline, which continues to be well received by customers and analysts. We continue to see momentum around our new security products like XDR, Secure Access, and Multicloud Defense with now over 1,000 customers deploying these products thus far. In Q1, we had a marquee win for over 75,000 cloud security seats with a multinational IT services and consultancy company. The customer largely replaced an SSE competitor with our solution and moved from planning to implementation in 120 days, highlighting how fast our teams can implement our solutions at scale.
We also booked our first seven-figure Hypershield deal in Q1. Collaboration product orders grew double digits again driven by demand for devices and our Cloud Webex suite. Finally, in observability, orders were up high single digits driven by our Network Assurance solution, ThousandEyes, and Splunk Observability. I'd also like to highlight some of the progress we've made integrating Splunk.
We now have a dozen updated data integrations between Cisco and Splunk across our security and networking portfolio, including Secure Firewall, Catalyst Center, SD-WAN, and ICE. We continue our joint selling motions between Cisco and Splunk, including secure -- Cisco Secure Network Analytics and XDR alongside Splunk's SIM offering enhanced capabilities to the security operations center. We also continue to build our market-leading observability solutions to accelerate full-stack observability for the enterprise. Overall, our Q1 results highlight continued strong demand for Cisco Technologies driven by the need for modern resilient networks as AI begins to scale.
Findings from our new global AI partner study show that IT partners around the world are anticipating a transformative wave of AI technology demand driven by infrastructure, cybersecurity, and customer experience, which they expect to fuel the majority of their revenue over the next four to five years. With the breadth of our portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this AI technology demand as customers are investing in their critical infrastructure to prepare for AI. In fact, there are three distinct but connected pillars to the AI networking opportunity for Cisco, which we have outlined on a slide as part of our quarterly materials. First, AI training infrastructure for web-scale customers.
AI networks demand scalable, programmable low-power switches with advanced load balancing and observability. These characteristics in our products are driving hyperscalers to deploy the Cisco 8000 with Cisco's Silicon One G200 for maximum power efficiency in their back-end AI training networks. As further proof, we also won a new super spine AI networking use case with one of our web scale customers this quarter. Second, AI network connectivity.
This quarter, we booked further platform sales with global enterprise customers, who are leveraging our technology platforms to modernize and automate their network operations to prepare for large-scale connectivity to AI applications. Our technology platforms across switching, routing, security, and observability, will help enable our customers by leveraging cutting-edge innovations like AI-powered robotics and unmatched supply chain visibility. Third, AI network inference and enterprise clouds. Most of the CIOs and technology leaders we talk to say that their organizations are planning full GenAI adoption within the next two years.
Yet only 13% of organizations say their infrastructure is ready for AI today according to the Cisco AI Readiness Index. To help our customers prepare, we have announced two new additions to our data center infrastructure portfolio, a new NVIDIA-based AI server, and AI pods, including NVIDIA's AI enterprise cloud-native software platform and managed through Cisco Intersight to simplify and derisk AI infrastructure deployment. Our new AI server is expected to begin shipping next month, and our AI pods are orderable this month. In addition, Hyperfabric, our fabric as a service solution, which is expected to be available in early calendar 2025, and further simplifies infrastructure deployment and management while providing real-time visibility into network performance.
With these solutions, we are bringing the power of open hyperscale AI networking to the enterprise. We also continue to fuse AI capabilities into our products. Hypershield, our first truly distributed AI native cybersecurity solution built into the fabric of the network shows how we are delivering secure networking, making it easier for our customers to protect against evolving threats. Splunk's asset and risk intelligence solution is another example of how we are providing insights to help customers understand their security maturity and demonstrate compliance with evolving regulations.
In our collaboration portfolio, we recently introduced the Webex AI agent Studio and Cisco AI Assistant features for Webex Contact Center. These solutions use advanced conversational intelligence and automation to improve overall customer satisfaction. We have seen strong initial interest from customers and will continue to strengthen our collaboration products, increasing AI capabilities. We're also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in our services and customer experience organization.
Over 60% of our technical assistance center support cases are now touched by AI-enabled automation backed by our expertise for faster resolutions, which is leading to higher customer satisfaction scores. In addition, our internal AI assistant for TAC works alongside our engineers to improve quality and speed time to resolution while allowing our people to work on more complex and creative problem-solving. To summarize, as we look at what's occurring with AI, there are three key things happening. First, there is significant investment in back-end AI networks with hyperscalers focused on training.
Second, as enterprises look to adopt and deploy AI, they need to modernize and secure their infrastructure to prepare for pervasive deployment of AI applications. Finally, the combination of mature back-end models with enterprise AI application deployment will lead to increased capacity requirements on both private and public front-end cloud networks. Cisco is already playing a major role across all three of these significant opportunities and are uniquely positioned to win with the breadth of our product portfolio and our trusted customer relationships. I will now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.

Thanks, Chuck. We executed well in Q1 with strong order momentum, margins, and operating cash flow. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $13.8 billion, down 6% year over year. As a reminder, Q1 of fiscal '24 was the last quarter of significantly elevated backlog shipments.
Non-GAAP net income was $3.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance range at $0.91. Looking at our Q1 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $10.1 billion, down 9% and service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking was down 23%, primarily driven by the elevated level of shipment we saw a year ago.
As Chuck said, we saw strong order growth across our networking products as customers have worked down inventory and deployed the networking products we shipped them last year. Security was up 100%, primarily driven by growth in our threat intelligence, Detection, and Response offerings, which includes the offerings from Splunk, network security, and SASE, excluding Splunk, security grew 2%, and our security portfolio was particularly impacted by the delays in spending in U.S. Fed. Collaboration was down 3%, driven by declines in our on-prem Webex suite and collaboration devices, partially offset by growth in our contact center and CPaaS offerings.
Observability was up 36%, driven primarily by Observability Suite and growth in network assurance offerings. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 1% for the quarter. Looking at our recurring metrics. ARR ended the quarter at $29.9 billion, which increased 22% with product ARR growth of 42%.
Total subscription revenue increased 21% to $7.8 billion, representing 57% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 24% at $5.5 billion, with software subscription revenue up 35%. Total RPO was $40 billion, up 15% year over year. Product RPO grew 24% and total short-term RPO was up 15% to $20.3 billion.
Q1 product orders were up 20% year over year. Excluding Splunk, product orders were up 9% year over year. Looking at our product orders across our geographic segments. The Americas was up 17%, EMEA was up 26% and APJC was up 25%.
In our customer markets, enterprise is up 33%, service provider and cloud was up 28% and public sector was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 69.3%, up 220 basis points year over year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range and reaching the highest level in more than 20 years. Product gross margin was 68.9%, up 240 basis points, driven by Splunk, favorable product mix, productivity improvements, and the one-time benefit of duty drawback, partially offset by price. Services gross margin was 70.3%, up 130 basis points.
We continued our focus on profitability and financial discipline with non-GAAP operating margin above the high end of our guidance range at 34.1%. On the bottom line, Q1 non-GAAP net income was $3.7 billion and earnings per share were $0.91. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $18.7 billion.
Operating cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 54%. From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $2 billion of share repurchases. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q1, we closed two software acquisitions, deep factor to accelerate innovation in the Cisco Security Cloud and augment our secure access offerings and robust intelligence, which brings enhanced protection for AI models throughout their life cycle from development to production.
Additionally, we announced our intent to acquire deeper insights AI to expand our customer experience team's technology footprint and engineering talent, accelerating innovation and momentum of Cisco's CX AI capabilities and services. These investments are highly complementary to our internal R&D in line with our strategy to strengthen our position in security and AI with targeted strategic M&A. To summarize, we started the fiscal year with a solid quarter, highlighted by strong order growth, margins, and non-GAAP EPS. We remain focused on making strategic investments and accelerating innovation across our business to best capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see ahead, all underpinned by disciplined expense management.
It's this powerful combination that continues to fuel our strong cash flow generation as well as our ability to return significant value to shareholders. Turning to our financial guidance. For fiscal quarter Q2, our guidance is as follows: we expect revenue to be in the range of $13.75 billion to $13.95 billion. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins to be in the range of 68% to 69%.
Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.89 to $0.91. For fiscal year '25, our guidance is, we expect revenue to be in the range of $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.60 and to $3.66.
In both our Q2 and full-year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A.

Hello. I'll ask both my questions together. What is -- so cloud orders, cloud and service providers grew 22% ex Splunk, last quarter, it was only 2%. So, what is driving this massive growth in orders? And can you elaborate on the areas where you participate in cloud more specifics of switching, routing, optical, etc., where you have strength and the extent, meaning is it all cloud providers, cloud titans? Or are you focused like we have other vendors? Are you focused on certain cloud providers and not others? And my follow-up question is on margins.
Very strong gross margin, very strong operating margin this quarter. Talk about the drivers and sustainability of these margins. Thanks.
Charles H. Robbins

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Thank you, Tal. Thanks for being with us, and thanks for the question. So, I'll take the first one, which is service provider and specifically cloud orders.
So, if we step back and look at our service provider business, we were -- we were pleased, I think, first and foremost, starting with cable, it continues to be under pressure, but it's also the smallest portion of the business and is less impactful as it gets smaller. On the telco side, we actually saw some probably low single-digit growth in telco, which was positive to see. We saw some real -- some activity occurring in both Europe and in APJC, which was encouraging as well. And then we move to cloud or the web scale customers, that's where we had order growth in excess of 100%.
And what I would tell you is that four of the six largest players were all each in excess of 100%. So, it was not a concentration in one customer. It was actually four different customers, all above triple-digit growth for us. When we look at areas where we participate, you mentioned routing, switching, optical, etc., and we participate in all of those.
I did call out that we took orders for AI and web scale in excess of $300 million, putting us well on track for the $1 billion and to exceed the $1 billion for the year. We participate -- I'll start with -- we participate when we talk about AI, it's primarily -- it's systems underpinning GPUs and back-end networks. I talked about a super spine win, which would be systems that are actually interconnecting clusters in the back end. And then we also provide both systems and optics that are providing that same connectivity as well as the connectivity required from the back end to the front end.
So, we have a number of design wins in this space. We feel good about the progress we're making. And I would just say that this is one of the big benefits of our strategy, which is to basically sell to our customers in the way that they would like to consume the technology, whether it's by our silicon, by our systems, and I think having our own silicon is proving to be a real competitive advantage for us. So, we're pleased with that.
At the same time, I would say that the AI infrastructure represented just less than half of the total business we took from the web scale customers. So, we still saw strength in the traditional cloud side as well, and we're pleased with the performance that we showed there. Scott, do you want to take the margin call?
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Tal, the margins were very strong. Of course, we had non-GAAP total gross margins of 69.3%, as Chuck said earlier, the highest that we've had in 20 years. The product non-GAAP gross margin of 68.9%, up 240 basis points.
There's a handful of things driving that. Obviously, the year-on-year increase includes the addition of Splunk, which is favorable at the gross margin line, of course, it also -- we had other favorable product mix built into that. A nice job continues to be done by the team on what I'll call productivity enhancements. So, continuing to drive cost out of the cost of goods sold line.
supply chain team has done a really nice job on that front. That is sustainable. We did have a one-time benefit in Q1 in the cost of goods sold line. for a project that's been on flight for several years around duty drawback.
So, these are components that we imported that incurred a tariff. They were built into final product, and then subsequently exported. When that happens, of course, you get the ability to get a return on that. We've been working to get a return of the tariff that you paid at the point of import.
We've been working on this project for some time. During the quarter, those filings were accepted. And so, we got a one-time benefit that's fairly substantial in Q1. Having said that, on the back of the great work the team has done, as I look at the next three quarters of the year, and you see this in our Q2 guide.
I would expect to see gross margins continue to settle into this range of 68% to 69% for the full year. And that, of course, will be a tailwind to op margin as well.

Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. So, my question is mainly around macro. Just wondering, maybe, Chuck, if you can speak to how the macro backdrops evolved over the last three months? And then maybe to double-click on that as a quick follow-up. As it relates to the election, just wondering if there's any hesitation, any impact in terms of buying behavior across different verticals, given some of the uncertainty around U.S.
elections intra-quarter? Thanks.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Matt. So, on the macro front, I think first and foremost, I would say that Scott mentioned the U.S. Federal challenges, and that will tie into your second question. So, I'll cover a little bit of that there.
I think the U.S. Federal business was impacted by the continuing resolution pressure and then also the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which expires at the end of this calendar year. Both of those put pressure on Federal. I think we've heard that from some of our peers in their earnings announcements.
If you normalize out or if you actually look at our product orders without Splunk, so the organic product order growth and you just removed the U.S. Federal year over year. The rest of the world was up in the mid- to high teens. So, what that tells you is that we saw very balanced strength around the world.
Geographically, we saw good strength in Europe, good strength in Asia. Without U.S. Fed, we saw good strength in the United States. We saw really strong recovery in enterprise.
We're pleased with that. I discussed already the service provider performance that we had during the quarter. And so, I think the only real vertical I would call out is the U.S. Federal issue that I just explained.
I don't think there's anything else that we've seen relative to the elections at this point.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
No. And the thing to think about, Matt, about the delays that we're seeing in U.S. Fed is there are delays. This is not deals that were lost through that.
It's pressure that's being put on by the funding of continuing resolution in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. So, we do see some of those coming back as we get past the continuing resolutions. It looks like the Republicans will carry both houses of Congress and the White House. And so, I would expect to get a budget in place relatively.
So, I do think we'll see -- those aren't lost transactions. And just to emphasize the point that Chuck just said, total product order growth Organically and excluding the impact of U.S. Fed is up mid to high teens, so I think in line with what you would have expected.
Charles H. Robbins

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to ask about security.
It was encouraging to hear about the first seven-figure Hypershield deal in the quarter. Could you just talk a little bit more about that, the nature of that deal? I think it was only recently made available, so it feels like it's early days, but maybe you can talk about the reception to that? And then secondly, I think you had mentioned security orders had doubled year over year, including Splunk. Could you just give us the organic number as well? And if you could speak qualitatively to the trends, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Michael. So, on your first question around Hypershield, this was a very large financial institution that was part of the early adopter planning, and that's what we're seeing. This is a very high-impact solution that actually is very effective in some of the most, I'd say, advanced data centers in the world.
So, we see very large customers that have been deploying it. So, we're going to see, I think, a little a gradual uptick in customers adopting it. And we have a bit of a white glove program right now that we're using to help these customers get up and running. So, we're really pleased to see that because when a large bank makes a commitment like that, that tells you the technology is real.
And in many cases, they will lead the rest of the enterprise and actually deploying these new security technologies. So, that's a good sign. On the security orders, we had a bit of the same issue that we had with U.S. Federal on the overall product order growth.
U.S. Federal is our largest -- contains our largest customer in the world and probably our largest security customer in the world. And so, our security orders were up in the mid -- low to mid-single digits without Splunk, the organic ones. And then -- but without U.S.
Federal, it tracked with the product data we gave you a few minutes ago. So, organic security orders if you normalize out the Federal year-over-year impact with the continuing resolution and the Federal -- the Fiscal Responsibility Act, they were up in the mid- to high teens as well. We crossed 1,000 customers that have deployed these new technologies that we rolled out over the last 12 to 15 months. So, we're pleased with the adoption that continues to occur there.
And I think if you listen to the analyst or follow the industry, I think there's a broad-based belief that our innovation pipeline and the technologies that we've been bringing to bear are going to be highly impacted for our customers, and I would say there's more to come. So, stay tuned.

UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. First, if I may. You mentioned, I think, Chuck, you mentioned half of your web-scale orders were AI with the other half sort of more traditional front end.
Is that sort of what drove the enterprise order growth? Or was there some campus recovery in that number from a product perspective? And then I'll just give you the second one for Scott. On gross margin, appreciate the color on sort of some of the impacts in the quarter. But from a Splunk perspective, was there anything else in the numbers like we're trying to think through kind of the contribution from Splunk subscription versus term licenses? And how should we think about that as we move through the balance of fiscal '25? Thank you.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
So, thanks, David. If I interpret your first question right, I think what you're asking is, was the non-AI portion of the cloud spend responsible for the enterprise growth that we saw? And so, I'm going to try to answer this. So, when we talk about the enterprise segment, we don't include any technology sold to the web scale customers regardless of what it is. So, the enterprise segment is simply enterprise customers buying whatever they buy from us.
So, that growth that we saw in enterprise was purely them. And I would also say that the majority of all of the web scale purchases from us were in the Internet infrastructure space. There was a smattering on the non-AI side that would be attributed to sort of classic enterprise technologies, but it was very small in the context of what they procure from us. Most of it was Internet infrastructure systems, optical routing, switching, etc.
Scott, the second one?
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. On the gross margin, this is what I was touching on earlier, David. We did have favorable product mix in there, and Splunk was a part of that. That drove the margins there was a one-time benefit in Q1 that I just touched on around duty drawback.
So, project we've had in place for some time, getting a refund of basically import duty that we had paid tariffs that we had paid on components that we imported built into products and then turned around and exported, and you're allowed to get those back. It's taken a while to get that -- all that paperwork pulled together, documented, and then get it approved and actually get the refund. That happened in Q1. So, we had a one-time benefit that's a catch-up from a couple of years of those that's not repeatable throughout the rest of the year.
There's a small tale of that, a little bit in Q2 and a little bit more in Q3 and Q4. The team has also done a really nice job continuing to drive costs out across the board. That's another thing that's driving that -- our view now of gross margins kind of maintaining in the 68% to 69% range through the end of the year. So, think of Splunk being a benefit, that's not new news.
I think what drove the outperformance in the quarter was much more about the one-time impact of the duty drawback project.

Hey, thanks for taking my questions. If I can ask both my questions at the same time. Chuck, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the data center switching portfolio had the third consecutive quarter of strong order growth. Just wondering how you're interpreting that in terms of enterprises are already starting to get ready for their AI deployments.
Or do you still believe that's largely in front of you? Just what is that sort of order momentum indicating to you? And then the second one, just on AI autos, you're sounding sort of better in relation to exceeding the $1 billion target. But is that -- is there necessarily an implication there in terms of revenue realization in the year? Is revenue realization maybe even a bit higher than you've thought initially in terms of timing? Thank you.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. So, on the data center switching side, I think what it shows is that, clearly, our customers continue to be balanced between which workloads they move to public cloud in which they move -- they build into the private infrastructure. We do see customers that are generally modernizing their infrastructure. We talked about this last quarter.
We see enterprise customers who are -- even when they're unsure about what AI applications they may deploy six, nine, 12 months from now, they do know that they need modern infrastructure to be prepared to do so, and we're seeing them forward invest to get ready for it. But this has been the same pattern we've seen for a few quarters now. And so, I think it's, to some extent, in preparation for it, but the last part of your first question, I would say that the majority of this build-out is still way ahead of us on the enterprise side. On the second question relative to AI orders and the fact that I think we're on track to exceed the $1 billion.
The one comment I'd make on the orders, and I'll let Scott speak to the revenue implications. I think that these customers, it's a very dynamic market and they have a lot of rapidly changing requirements. And so, as we see these opportunities arise and we get designed in, so when we get the design wins as we talk about. Then ultimately, they become bookings, and then ultimately, they become revenue.
In many cases, a design win means that they have confidence that we can actually design a piece of silicon that they're looking for. We put it into a system, we deliver the system. And so, the timing varies depending on what we want from them. And so, that's why you're going to see the stuff show up in our guidance, and you're going to see it show up as we continue to execute, and you've heard me talk about the need to continue to execute on several calls in a row in this space, but I feel really good about the job the team is doing right now.
So, that will lead to the answer to the revenue question. Scott, do you --
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And on the revenue question, as Chuck said, this is a bit dynamic in terms of shipments. Obviously, we don't get revenue until we ship the product out the door and there's a number of factors that goes into that some -- most of which are not within our control, we do see though this driving revenue, consistent with what we've said in the past, Samik, driving revenue for us more in the second half of the year. The majority of the revenue that we get from that will be in the second half.

Great. Thanks for taking the question. First one is I'd love to get maybe an update or double-click on the partnership you announced with NVIDIA very early in like to sort of get a sense of how that's progressing in terms of traction and where that fits into the pipeline. I did catch that.
You mentioned you've got an AI server. Just sort of wondering if that's an outcome of that alignment. And my follow-up is pretty straightforward you've earlier talked about the Splunk opportunities of new potential customers being introduced to Splunk. If you could update us on the progress there and sort of your line of sight to closing some of those deals? Thank you.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Simon. So, on the NVIDIA partnership, I think we're still really early on bringing these solutions to market. So, if you think back a couple of quarters back, we announced Hyperfabric, which is a fabric-as-a-service solution to bring sort of that public cloud simplicity to AI workloads in the enterprise, and that will be shipping in the first portion of calendar 2025.
But we did announce this quarter to new platforms. We announced our AI compute platform that is -- the first phase of that is based on NVIDIA GPUs, and we announced AI pods, which are also based on NVIDIA GPUs. Over time, you'll see us support other GPUs as the market demands, but that partnership is still going fine. It's still early.
And I think 2025 is when we'll start to see enterprise real deployment of some of these technologies. On the second one, the Splunk customers update, I would say we continue to see good progress. If you really think about where we are with Splunk, we have -- I think we closed the acquisition in March. We're in November.
So, that's about eight months. And if you ask Gary, he would tell you their average sales cycle is nine months. So, we haven't we haven't even gotten, and we didn't start this initiative until probably into the second quarter that they were part of us. So, I think it's still super early.
What I would tell you is that we've the criteria that we use to identify these customers was based on certain attributes of the customer that would lead them to be a viable Splunk candidate. And we've added about 1,500 more customers to that list. But the other thing that I think is really a positive sign is we have hundreds of Cisco partners now that have been trained on Splunk that are building out Splunk practices, and in some cases, have actually gone out and made strategic acquisitions of Splunk Partners to accelerate and bring them into their business. So, on that front, we're super positive about how that's progressing as well.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is from a just overall perspective on Splunk integration, it's progressing in line with our expectations on the top line and in the ARR in particular, and actually ahead of our expectations on profitability at this point. So, Splunk overall is tracking quite well for us.

Hey, guys. Scott, for you, just circling back on RPO. What was RPO and products RPO growth at Splunk and then, Chuck, for you, how are you guys thinking about not just enterprise refresh potential, but also the campus refresh opportunity with WiFi 7 availability that you guys, I think, even announced this week. And will that WiFi 7 encourage any campus switch refresh as well? Thanks, guys.
Go ahead.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Jim, on the RPO, we don't actually -- we're not going to continue to break out with and without Splunk, and that's partly because of what I just said. This integration is going well. We've launched several products now that are joint products of both Cisco and Splunk.
From an organizational standpoint, we've brought in all of the G&A functions and are quickly adopting -- or integrating across the product lines. So, it's getting harder and harder to say what's Splunk and what's not Splunk. That line is just getting blurry and blurry each quarter. So, I don't plan on breaking that out.
I would tell you, of course, without Splunk, it still is a positive growth rate that's in sync with where we've been historically. But I really want to get a way of trying to draw that line for you.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Jim, on the campus refresh, I think, look, our overall enterprise networking business was very strong during the quarter. So, we are continuing to see that refresh. You mentioned WiFi that we did announce the high-end versions during the quarter.
This is a big -- it's a big first step for us because it's one of the first platforms that we've had that you can deploy and run under an on-prem management system or a cloud management system with the same license and use the same hardware. So, that's been something we've been working on for a while. It's hardware portability between both on-prem and cloud, but we see customers continue because if you think about the AI deployment and you think about starting first in the back end of AI, which we've seen. And then as you see this pervasive deployment of AI applications in the enterprise, that's going to have dual impact.
Number one, if it's going to create that front-end network pool that we talk about because the enterprises are going to be connecting back to the cloud to take advantage of their models. And then it's also going to continue to pull the refresh in the enterprise side because they're going to need their networks modernized to be able to run edge-based versions of AI, etc. So, we think the refresh opportunity is real for some period of time and, in large part, will be driven by this AI wave.

Great. Thanks. Maybe circling back to Michael's question where you answered that kind of organic security growth would have been in kind of the mid- to high teens if you stripped out of U.S. Federal -- just wanted to get a sense of kind of what was driving some of that strength.
Is that data center modernization or just what products are kind of driving some of that upside? And then just second question, just on data center modernization as a tailwind, just where are you kind of seeing kind of prioritization, the most kind of within the data center? Is it kind of around security or updating and switching? Just kind of any commentary around kind of categories you're seeing that data center modernization take place in. Thanks.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Meta. I think when you look at the security performance, if you just put U.S. Fed to the side, I think you're -- we're seeing the impact of these new products between XDR, Secure Access, Multicloud Defense, we've seen over 1,000 customers now deploy those new technologies that we didn't have in our portfolio 18 months ago. We see HyperShield with very positive early feedback.
And that's not a big contributor to the order side yet, but I think it will be, and it creates a mine share pull from our customers because it's so innovative sometimes it leads them to look at the rest of the portfolio again. We also have completed a refresh of the low-end firewall in the most recent quarter. We've had -- the high end was refreshed in 2024. In the early part, the mid-range was refreshed in the latter part of '24.
So, I mean, there's a lot that has been going on that I think is contributing to that energy in security. But in general, I think the market, the analysts, the customers all believe that where we are today versus where we were three, four years ago, and security is just fundamentally different. On the data center side, the data center modernization that I've been talking about was largely around switching infrastructure. But I think the Hypershield momentum that we're feeling, at least from a mind-share perspective with customers would suggest that security is a massive opportunity in that space.
As we've talked about, if you start with a fundamental assumption that the bad actors are in your infrastructure, then the thing you need to do is stop the east-west traffic in the data center, and that's one of the key roles at Hypershield plays. So, I think that's a big focus area for our customers as well. But most of what we've seen happening when we talk about data center modernization and the momentum that we've seen there has fundamentally been around switching.

Hey, thanks a lot. It's great to be chatting with you. Hey, Chuck, I asked this last quarter, and I was wondering if you had any update. I understand that customers are getting ready for AI and feel they need to have the latest and greatest year for it.
Are you getting a sense of what they're engaging you for? Is it -- do they feel like there's going to be more inferencing? Is there specific applications that they're citing? I think investors would love to know what you potentially are hitching a ride to there on that comment. And then I had a follow-up question for you and Scott is just these performances where the orders move around Splunk, given the excess backlog can be a little confusing for investors. But you said one thing at your Analyst Day, where you're going to grow 4% to 6%. And I know that's next year and beyond.
But is there anything happening near term that makes you feel better about that long-term target where you're a mid-single-digit grower? Anything that happened that making you feel better or worse regarding it, that would be great to hear. Thanks.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Ben, thanks. So, on the -- on the first question relative to AI in the enterprise in particular, I think we're all seeing customers focus on customer experience. That's one of the big early applications that virtually every enterprise that we engage with is looking at, including Cisco and everybody else. So, everybody is focused on that.
Then the second, I think, is largely they are building different applications that are contributing to automation and efficiency, like we've talked about with robotics or supply chain management. We also see a lot of AI activity around deeper engagement with the customer. So, customer experience on the support side, but then upselling, cross-selling customers. We see a lot of focus on that on understanding purchasing trends.
And in those cases, what we see customers doing and this is leading to my belief about what's happening in the AI shift right now is customers are needing to leverage the value provided by the foundational models, but they also need to be able to train their custom data and then the inferencing applications are actually making calls into both of those data sets, obviously. And we think that's going to lead to the front-end network build-out that we've talked about a lot in addition to the back end. It also is leading some customers to build out some of this data center modernization in their private clouds, and it's leading them to think about modernizing their overall infrastructure for edge-based versions of that over time. So, that's generally what we're seeing.
I'll make a quick comment on the second one and then I'll hand it to Scott. I would say that as we continue to see more and more success and more progress relative to the web scale customers and their acceptance of the AI solutions that we're delivering and our team is delivering and us achieving the numbers that we put out there and exceeding those numbers, then that contributes to my confidence in the next few years. Scott?
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
No, I think you said it right, Chuck. The way I think about that is it is hard right now, Ben, to compare the year-on-year product order growth rates because of what happened last year with all the inventory digestion that needed to go on. So, one thing you can do right now is start to look at what the sequential -- the ex Splunk sequential product order growth rates look like and get a better sense of the demand that we're seeing coming back into that marketplace. And as we lap these more normal -- you know, normal demand is normalizing.
As we lap these more normal demand quarters, you'll begin to see something that fits into the pattern. That is going to be easier to discern what's happening overall from a demand standpoint. I would say the investments that we're making in AI, the investments that we're making across the networking portfolio with some of the platform work that we're doing in WiFi 7 that we just launched yesterday is a combined platform product, same product that could be run with either platform in the back end to control it. Those investments are paying off.
And so, I feel good about what we put out. Obviously, when we put those numbers out. We wanted to be a little bit conservative with them to ensure that as we got to '26 and '27, we not only hit those but had a chance to overachieve on that. And right now, I'd say the investments that we're making in that space to drive growth are paying off.

Yep. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll ask a question and follow up at the same time. Scott, net booking revenues were down 23% this quarter.
Just talk about how did that stack up against your expectations. And now that backlog is normalized, should the expectation to grow sequentially for the rest of 2025 and we really help us understand how that grew for the rest of the year? And then over the next three years, are you more excited about hyperscale or Hypershield? Which one is the better option for you? Thank you.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I got to say, Amit, I'll start on the first one, there was some background noise as you were asking the question, I'm not sure I got the entire question, but it started with networking revenue being down 23%. Of course, remember, that's comparing to Q1 and '24, where we had a very substantial shipment of excess backlog basically backlog that had built up during the supply constraints that we cleared very quickly. Q1 of '24 was the third of three consecutive quarters with very heavy backlog shipment into it.
If you net that out, I think we did some of that math for you on the last call gives you a better sense of what's happening in network demand. It's trending in line with our expectations. I'd say AI has been a bright spot for us. The bookings that we're seeing inside AI haven't yet turned into revenue, but we certainly are seeing good momentum from that standpoint.
DC switching, as Chuck just pointed out, has continued to be strong for us. So, feeling good overall relative to our expectations about what we're seeing in networking. And if I missed the second part of your question, we'll circle back to you afterwards and get to it.
Charles H. Robbins

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And then your second question relative to am I more excited, I think you said about Hypershield or Hyperfabric. I know there are both hyper words. So, those are probably the two you mentioned. I am equally excited, I think from a security perspective and a strategic security perspective, our large enterprise customers are incredibly optimistic about what Hypershield meets for them.
But from an AI application deployment perspective, customers are very excited about what Hyperfabric will mean to them. So, if you think about two of the most important objectives our customers have, which is east-west data center security. And secondly, how do I simplify the deployment of AI applications? These are two very core technologies to both those things that we think will be important to our customers for the next few years.

Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I just wanted to get some more detail on the gross margin improvement. Any chance you can break out that duty drawdown impact in the quarter? I'd be curious as to what that is.
And then, obviously, you also saw quite a sequential improvement in gross margin. Obviously, Splunk was in, obviously, the quarter and last quarter as well. So, I think product mix is probably a pretty big factor here. I'm wondering if there was a big difference in terms of the mix of UCS servers or other product lines that kind of drove the day there.
Any details would be great. Thanks.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Sure. And the -- you know, I talked about gross margin improvement during Q1, in particular, having a one-time benefit from the duty drawback. It's a couple of years of duty that we've been working through this process of not just getting the filings together but getting it all approved and getting the cash back. I would say that was a substantial contributor to the benefit we saw in Q1, somewhere between probably a half point and one point of improvement just driven by that.
There will be a tail of those now that we've got that process in place. It will be significantly less as we look at Q2, Q3, and Q4. On the product mix front, we definitely got a benefit from Splunk coming in, not surprisingly. As you know, they had gross margins -- product gross margins in the 80% range.
That's been a tailwind to us overall. There's also favorable product mix across some other product lines inside there and that will continue. The team has also done a really nice job driving costs out, as I said earlier, I give credit to our supply chain and our product teams on continuing to drive costs out of that cost infrastructure. So, full year, I see those gross margins settling into the range that we guided in Q2 into that 68% to 69% range.
I would point out that pricing is back to the normalized trend that we had seen pre pandemic, which is somewhere between one point and two points of headwind exactly as we saw kind of pre pandemic. So, no change from a pricing standpoint.

Thank you. Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.
Aaron Rakers
--
Analyst
Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll keep two right together here. So, on this AI opportunity and as we kind of focus on the backlog converting into revenue, I'm curious of how you see the AI back end possibly leading into front-end opportunities.
Have you seen that at all with any of these hyperscale customers? Any kind of color on that front would be great. And then kind of sticking to the AI networking theme, I'm curious as we move forward, how you would characterize the competitive positioning of NVIDIA in the Ethernet back-end network side. Thank you.
Charles H. Robbins
--
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Aaron. So, on the back end -- the front-end topic, which has been pretty popular lately, the way I think about it is that there's meaningful investment today going into the back-end training models as we all know. And then I think the enterprise is actually looking at two different things that are going on there. Number one, they're updating their infrastructure to prepare for AI and then they're preparing for pervasive deployment of AI applications.
And I think that -- what that will do in my opinion, is that will then subsequently drive a lot of the front-end capacity need because those customers will be leveraging both the back end and the front-end capacity of the cloud infrastructure to actually deliver their own AI apps. And so, I think we're continuing to see investment in the front end. Customers continue to make those decisions where they want to run workloads in the cloud. They haven't stopped moving workloads to the cloud.
So, we still see that happening. But I do think the enterprise AI pervasive deployment will be the most meaningful driver of the increased capacity demand on the front-end networks. When you look at the competitive positioning of NVIDIA, I think, look, we live in a world where we have great customers, great partners that we also compete with. There are several examples that are out there.
In video, we have partnered with meaningfully. I talked about it earlier with the products that we've built. That includes their technology, not only GPUs but, in some cases, their software layer. But obviously, with Spectrum X, there are areas where we're going to compete.
And I think that -- look, we got 40 years of building highly featured Ethernet and a lot of experience with our customers using it. We're seeing the success in the back-end networks. I think the other thing that many of our largest customers also want is vendor diversity. And so, I think all of those things combined with our own silicon in our ability to bring our own intellectual property up and down the entire stack puts us in a pretty good position competitively.

Yes. Thank you. I have two as well if I may. Scott, I want to focus first on the general quarter outlook, which implies that opex is down about $90 million.
I think most of the roughly 10% workforce realignment this calendar year has been completed. And so, I was hoping you could address which areas of your business do you believe you need to accelerate investment to drive growth into '25 and '26 versus having some excess cost savings passed on to profitability. And I have a follow-up.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
OK. Do you want to go ahead and ask a follow-up now, Karl?
Karl Ackerman
--
Analyst
Sure. Yes. In terms of follow-up, just -- you spoke about for cloud hyperscalers growing orders triple digits, which is quite amazing and great. But I guess, are these product orders all for top-of-rack switches, or is the growth in AI networking hardware primarily driven by one hyperscaler today which is now to be across silicon and switches? Thank you.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I'll start with the opex and then, Chuck, let you talk about the cloud partners that are growing triple digits. On the opex, there is growth. Of course, you got to remember Q2 of this year will compare to Q2 of last year when we did not have Splunk as part of the company.
We closed Splunk in the middle of our Q3. So, a lot of what you see driving the year-on-year growth rate in opex is simply the addition of Splunk. We talked about when we did the restructuring that it was not necessarily about driving cost savings. There are some cost savings coming out of it, but that was not the motivating factor.
It was more about finding efficiencies across the company and turning around and reinvesting those in the fastest growing parts of our business, namely AI and security, and you see some of the great results coming out of that. So, think about those as the two areas we're investing but the year-on-year growth rate and opex being driven mostly by the addition of Splunk.
Charles H. Robbins

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And then on your second question, Karl, I think we are pleased that four out of the six largest -- we're all in excess of 100% growth year over year. And I would say that it was not just one customer on the AI infrastructure front. It was pretty balanced across all of them. So, we'll continue to keep plugging away, but it was pretty balanced and we're pretty happy with the distributed nature of the business in that segment.

Yeah. I just want to thank everybody again for joining us, and I want to particularly thank the Cisco teams for their -- the innovation that our teams are delivering as well as the strong execution that we've seen in the first quarter of this year really got us off to a strong start. I think that as we talk about this whole AI transformation that's happening. I think, again, there are three big areas that we're focused on.
Number one is the infrastructure required in the back end of networks to help our customers continue to build these training models. I think the second is we look at the enterprise space. And again, we see upgrades and refresh opportunities for customers who are preparing for AI and then we see the ability to work with them and their data centers with this simplistic deployment of AI applications that we're going to enable. And then the final area is continuing to work with the cloud providers and the enterprise customers on private data center and the front-end requirements that we see happening in the cloud side to support this AI transition as well.
We think that the breadth of our portfolio gives us a great opportunity. We also think that our continued momentum in security, notwithstanding what happened in U.S. Federal this quarter gives us a high degree of confidence, and we look forward to talking to all of you again next quarter.

Chief Executive Officer
[Audio gap] Demand growth in our Nexus portfolio, our data center switching, which predominantly goes into private cloud infrastructure into the enterprise. And then obviously, the web-scale performance that we saw with five out of the -- or I'm sorry, three out of the six growing over 100% year over year, two of the six growing over 50% year over year, so it was very balanced. And so, far, I think that despite the geopolitical risk, despite the uncertainty that's going on in the U.S. and in the marketplace around the world, I think the one thing our customers understand is that their need to continue spending on technology is just there.
And there's so much change going on right now from a technology perspective that there's both excitement about the opportunity, and candidly, there's a little bit of fear of slowing down too much and letting your competition get too much ahead of you. So, we saw solid demand.

Yeah, hey, thanks a lot, guys, and congrats on the quarter. It's good to see you guys with the momentum. Chuck, we've got a lot of questions very recently about a new switch that you just put out, the 9,300 Nexus. And this programmable switch market looks like there's a lot of strong prospects there.
Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that product and maybe why you went with AMD for the product and what that means for your -- versus your NVIDIA products. And my follow-up just is with regard to the overall comment of just overall demand just sounds much better than a few quarters ago. I just wanted some -- the view that -- do you still think people are getting ready for AI? Or I don't know if I heard that from you this time that, in the last two quarters, people were getting ready for AI, and it picked up. And this just sounded like a little more firm, but I was just wondering for a little more color on that.
Hopefully, that didn't run on too long, Sami, but I'll pass it back to you.
Chuck Robbins

Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ben. No, we got them both. Look, first and foremost, I want to just thank the team in our product organization because the innovation that they've been delivering over the last 12 to 18 months has been at a pace that we haven't seen in a very long time. We've seen a lot on the collab space in the security space, a lot in the silicon space, and then in the web scale infrastructure.
And now I think what you referenced this switch with the DPU in it is a great example of the innovation that we are going to drive in our core networking portfolio. And so, it's -- I can't speak to exactly why the team chose the AMD, DPU other than I'm sure they did an analysis and thought it was the best solution for us. But this is a real -- it's a breakthrough product because it allows us to Candidly, we can take security out of these appliances that they come in and put it where it belongs, which is everywhere. Security needs to be deployed everywhere, and this really allows us to integrate security deeply into the network and at the speed of the network.
So, what this allows us to do is -- you can run network services or security services on these DPUs in the network at the speed of the ASICs as opposed to moving this traffic to a central place where you're going to be limited by the processing power of a single box. And so, the first use case, as you are aware, is Hypershield, which we announced, and we had a couple of big Fortune wins in the prior quarter, even as we're just building out the final capabilities on Hypershield. So, that's going to be the first deployment. If you think about the use case, you could put one of these switches sitting at between zones in a data center and running all the traffic through it at line speed and doing security inspection via Hypershield to protect different zones from east-west threats.
So, it's -- we think it's got a lot of potential, and this is just the first service or first use case that the teams have come up with. On your second question, we absolutely believe that a lot of this demand is being driven by customers preparing for AI. We even think a lot of the telco demand that we see is -- or the telcos building out their networks to be prepared to deliver AI as a service or AI-driven services. And so, while I didn't call it out, it's one of the pillars that we talk about relative to our role in AI, and we do think there's an acceleration of companies that are just trying to get prepared for what they're going to need.
It's clear that a genetic AI work streams are going to put more capacity onto the network.

Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just maybe to dovetail on the prior question. You talked -- talk about enterprises investing a little bit more in AI. I'm just wondering, as they've come into the new calendar, what you're seeing in hearing specifically from enterprise customers on the AI front and how meaningful it is for your business today.
And then just as a follow-up, maybe for Scott. You did about 68.7% on a gross margin front this past quarter. I think the guide implies a step down to between 67% to 68%. I'm wondering maybe what informs that view.
Thanks so much.
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
So, I would say what we're seeing on the enterprise side relative to AI is it's still -- customers are still in the very early days, and they all realize they need to figure out exactly what their use cases are. We're starting to see some spending though on specific AI-driven infrastructure. And we think as we get AI pods out there -- we got Hyperfabric coming. We got AI defense coming.
We have Hypershield in the market. And we got this new DPU switch, they are all going to be a part of the infrastructure to support these AI applications. So, we're beginning to see it happen, but I think it's also really important to understand that as the enterprises leverage their private data, their proprietary data, and they'll do some training on that and then they'll run inference obviously against that. We believe that opportunity is an order of magnitude higher than what we've seen in training today.
We're going to continue to innovate and build capabilities to put ourselves in a better position to be a real beneficiary as this continues to accelerate. But as of today, we feel like we're in pretty good shape.
Richard Scott Herren

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
And Matthew, on your question on gross margin, the guide at 67% to 68% for Q3 -- and by the way, I think it settles in in that range for the full year. What's built into that and driving the step down from where we were in Q2 is we have -- and this was noted in the -- in my commentary upfront, we have built in the cost of the proposed tariffs that we've seen so far. So, the additional 10% in China, the 25% on Canada, and Mexico. Canada has a negligible impact on us.
And the steel and aluminum, we've quantified those out again, assuming the March 1 date. I think it's such a fluid environment right now. It's very difficult to say what's actually going to happen. But I wanted to protect the guide and ensure that we built in the 25% that's been proposed.
I will tell you we've got a supply chain team that over the last several years has built a lot of muscle around the tariff that we had in China and how do we work our way around that. And from the time that was first imposed to where we are now, our mitigation activities have reduced our exposure there by about 80%. So, we've game-planned out several scenarios and steps we could take depending on what actually goes into effect, we'll start to take those steps to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. But what I built into the cost of goods sold, that's where the tariffs will hit, is the full effect of 25% in Mexico, Canada, and additional 10% in China, with no mitigation at this point -- but no mitigation built in at this time.

Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I'll follow up on that tariff question to start off. You do mention you're embedding in the cost of the tariffs, but I think we're getting a lot of questions also in terms of how to think about demand. So, Chuck or Scott, I mean, any thoughts in terms of how you've seen enterprises -- enterprise customers respond on a demand basis to previous tariffs? And how does that inform your view in terms of what to expect for demand? And sort of -- are you seeing any pull forward from customers to avoid some of these tariffs in the first place? And for my follow-up, I think it's more about hyperscaler and the AI momentum you're seeing there.
You're seeing strong momentum in orders, but what is -- maybe if you can give us some insights on deployments, we can see the strong capex numbers or guidance from them, but is there any acceleration or sort of more on track in terms of deployment base relative to what you expected? Thank you.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Samik, on the first question, we're not seeing any evidence of customer pulling demand ahead. I think the tariff environment is very fluid right now. It's a very dynamic environment. While everyone is taking note, I think until we know what's actually going to go into effect, it will be very difficult for our customers to decide what to do.
I think the other thing that as we look at the steps we would take to mitigate the impact of demand, there are a number of steps we can take to offset the cost. We obviously would have price as a lever, but there's a number of considerations that we have to go through before we got there. Right now, I don't envision that. What we would look to do first is make some of the changes we need to make inside the supply chain to mitigate the impact of whatever tariff regime gets put into place.
So, not seeing any evidence of any pull ahead in demand.
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And Samik, I think on the question relative to the web scale demand versus their deployments, I think that there -- I think the bottom line is that I've set with all these customers, and they've looked at me and said, ""If you can build more, we will buy more."" So, I think that a couple of them had initial targets for how many units they wanted in 2025, and that number has already gone up by 50%. So, I think the deployments are moving very rapidly and on track and we continue to respond to all of their demand. And frankly, the changes that they make as their strategy evolves on it's a very dynamic.
It's a very dynamic market.

Hi. Great quarter, but I have a question about maybe the weaker parts. If my math is right, and I'm not sure it's right. So, I need clarification.
Splunk was down 11% this quarter year over year, maybe my numbers are totally wrong. So, if you can clarify what's happening with Splunk, can you give us an update on the trends? And the second question is security and observability. It's supposed to accelerate -- it accelerated last quarter. Can you talk about the trends this quarter and kind of the good parts and the bad parts of the growth? Thanks.
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
OK. I'll take the first one, and then, Chuck, we can tag team in a second if you want. On the -- I'm not sure what math you're doing, Tal. I think one thing that is not visible to you with the math that you've got in front of you is the end of Splunk's quarter, their fiscal -- by the way, this would have been the end of January was the end of their prior Q4.
So, as with every enterprise software company, of course, Q4 is the biggest quarter of the year. And in fact, it gets back-end loaded so that the Week 13 of that Q4 is the biggest week of the quarter. The way the calendar fell this year, our fiscal quarter ended on January '25. So, that last week of January that was historically Splunk's Q4, actually, is not captured in our Q2 results.
It will flow into our Q3 results. That may be what's throwing you off on the math. Splunk is still growing double digits. It's really right in line with our expectations modestly ahead of our expectations on the top line and is profitable well ahead of when we expected it to be profitable.
So, Splunk's performing quite nicely for us.
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yes. On the security front, what I would say, Tal, is that look, we had always said we expected to see the acceleration in the second half of this year. We saw the last four quarters of growth from a demand perspective in organic security, which is a good sign. And what we've launched is all this new innovation that just takes time to ramp, but I can give you a couple of data points.
If you just look at two of the of the products, Cisco Security and XDR, between those two, we now have those deployed at over 1,000 customers, and each of them are actually supporting over 1 million enterprise users each. So, we're seeing the success they just need time to ramp. We've also launched Hypershield. I said earlier we won two Fortune 100 enterprise customers this past quarter, and there's a great deal of excitement.
If you look at AI defense with the AI Summit that we did recently, there's -- I think there's about 20-some-odd customers who are interested in going to proof of concept with us right now on it. We had almost half the Fortune 100 there for that event. So, I feel good about where we are. It will turn into greater demand as we just continue to scale these products.

Great. Thanks. Just a quick question on the 700 million AI orders so far this year. Are these mainly switching in optical wins? Are you seeing wins other products? And then just curious if you're using any of these you see some very strong AI orders.
Are we expecting it to start converting into revenue this fiscal year, or is that more of a fiscal '26 dynamic? Thank you.
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Amit. I'll take the first, and then, Scott, you speak to the revenue. On the $700 million in AI orders, it's a combination of systems, silicon, optics, and optical systems. And I think if you break it down, it's about half is in silicon and systems.
And -- but it's -- it continues to accelerate. And I'd say the teams have done a great job on the silicon front. We've invested heavily in more resources there. The team is running parallel development efforts for multiple chips that are staggered in their time frames.
They've worked hard. They were increasing the yield, which is a positive thing. And so, we feel good about it, but it's a combination of all those things that we're selling to the customers. Scott, on the revenue side?
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Amit, it's no different than what we've said all along about when we expect this to turn into revenue. We knew the orders would come in well ahead of the actual ship dates. We do expect to see this revenue begin to ramp in the second half of the year, and that's consistent with what we've said from the start.

Hey, guys, nice quarter. Working off a few things you guys just have talked about here. Can you just first give us an update as to the actual penetration of the 6,500 large customers you guys expected between Cisco and Splunk to jointly go after and any further bundling plans you have, but beyond what you just announced? And then secondly, to the last question, what are you guys seeing from where you're winning within the data center between the Silicon One approach versus sort of the systems approach with your AI wins? Would love additional color there. Thanks, guys.

Thanks, Jim. So, on the Splunk side, I would say it's still early. These are still long sales cycles. And we're continuing to make progress.
We are having wins. I mean, they're clearly out there. We also have seen the benefit of the portfolio coming together with large customers doing our broad-based, what we call WPAs, and that are inclusive of Splunk now, the old Cisco WPA that are inclusive of Splunk. And we talked about this had a deal that they were leading that actually expanded the Cisco footprint.
So, we are beginning to see that, and we'll continue to see it as we go forward. I think you'll see as we get into the next couple of quarters, you're going to see more and more cross-selling sales incentives that the teams are putting in place that I think will continue to accelerate that. And on the second question, I think it was about how they're looking at systems versus -- silicon systems versus silicon. Yeah.
I think that by and large, it's systems. Actual just raw silicon sales are still very small as a percentage of the total business. So, the general method of consumption is just to buy the systems.

Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. I'll give you both obviously at the same time. So, I'm just trying to square, Chuck, your comments about the strength that you're seeing across the business because it looks like ex-Splunk enterprise orders maybe decelerated a little bit sequentially and the strength in, I guess it looks like the Americas was mostly SP and cloud.
And then the second question I have is maybe longer term, there's been a high number or a large number of project announcements over the last couple of weeks with some pretty big announcements from maybe the white box ODM space with some big wins as well. So, maybe anything you can touch on from a competitive perspective on how you're thinking about maybe these bigger projects that have been announced maybe the risks out there from some of these other alternatives like DeepSeek, and then some of these wins that have been announced by some of the OD market and how you're thinking about the landscape? Thanks.
Chuck Robbins

Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. OK. So, first of all, on the enterprise, we've had four quarters of continued recovery. It was a little slower growth year over year than it was in Q1, but it's important to understand.
I think Q2 over Q1 was up 29%. We literally took over $1 billion more in orders in Q2 than Q1. So, I don't think there's anything to be overly concerned about right there. And we saw real good strength in Asia in double digits.
And I think Europe was close to double digits. And U.S. Enterprise just had a bunch of big deals in Q1 that I think just kind of slowed them down a little bit for Q2. On these other deals, I mean, if you look at technology like DeepSeek, we think as not DeepSeek in particular, but we think as we see more of this democratization of the access that is going to just facilitate a faster advancement of AI applications in the enterprise, first of all.
Secondly, I think we ran our AI defense model. I think we did 50 prompts and the team -- this was in 48 hours of this thing being out, and I think they proved every time that they could jailbreak this thing pretty easily. So, I think we got to be careful as well. And the final thing I'd say on a lot of these unique deals out there, these bigger deals, I think we'll -- we're having success in the web scale space.
And I think if we're being chosen in that space, I think we'll have a real good opportunity to play in these other emerging opportunities as they come about as well.

Hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, I'd like to follow up on the question regarding traction from enterprise customers in AI. Could you provide some additional color on where you are seeing Ethernet came in the enterprise segment, what kind of cluster side, what's use cases, which verticals? And then as a follow-up, I lost for your perspective on what you're hearing from these customers in terms of data center space and, in particular, access to power as potentially being a bottleneck to roll out infrastructure this year.
Thank you.
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Antoine. Yeah, I don't think that we're not thinking about it from massive clusters that the enterprises are going to build. They're certainly building clusters to do training on their own models or they're renting space from one of the major GP providers to actually do their training and then pulling that back. And the infrastructure we're talking about is really to support the inferencing side of it.
And I think by and large, to be candid, the customers who have bought like NVIDIA GPUs so far have just bought the whole stack on them. And so, we think that will be an emerging opportunity in the future. It's not really Ethernet under GPUs in the enterprise today, has been -- hasn't been a major opportunity to date. Now, we believe with the NVIDIA partnership, the hyper fabric stack, the AI pods, the things that we're building, we think that as we integrate that STACK together and they have these reference architectures to build that we think that that will lead to our networking equipment being combined with NVIDIA GPUs, and that's how we'll accomplish that in the future.
And candidly, I don't think the -- there hasn't been a lot of concern over the power issue in the enterprise like it has been in the web scale space.

Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may go ahead, sir.
Aaron Rakers

Analyst
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. I'll stick with the AI theme first, and then I'll throw out my quick follow-up. On the AI side, I think in the prepared comments, you had mentioned that your 51.22 silicon will come out, I think it was April time frame.
As you think about that 50% of your business on the AI orders being tied to switch and Silicon One silicon. Would you say that that is kind of the point of inflection like the majority of your AI wins are tied to that 51.22 silicon? Or just kind of trying to understand kind of the opening up of this monetization opportunity. And then as a follow-up, I'm just curious like on the campus side, just kind of -- help us appreciate maybe the WiFi 7 precycle that you're starting to see or how you're thinking about that. Thank you.
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think the comments we made on the 51.2 really was more of an enterprise comment in the Nexus portfolio, but it is Silicon One-based. And so, those chips will be used in the 8,000s as an example. But this is a -- if you get back to the silicon discussion that we had earlier, that team is designing multiple silicon architectures based on the use cases on the customer.
Do they need deep buffers? Do they not need deep buffers? I mean, it's really -- is it a low-latency application? I mean, these -- all of these things come into play as they develop different pieces of silicon for that marketplace. So, we'll continue to develop and 51.2 is -- and then beyond, and they're already working on just subsequent chips that will continue to crank up the speeds in these data centers. On the campus side, I think that we're continuing to see the campus switching infrastructure, as I talked about earlier. And it's early days on the WiFi 7.
I'd say customers are getting ready to begin deploying. I think we're going to move into that over the next two to three quarters where we'll see a full transition, both in the traditional on-prem access points and then also in the cloud managed.

Yes. Thank you. Within Enterprise Networking, I think a couple of quarters ago, customer lead times bottom out at just a few weeks. Is the greater visibility and support of your April core outlook from enterprises and even telco operators coming from just a return to no order patterns or lead times extending out beyond a quarter across those customers as you begin to introduce AI pods and Hybridshield and perhaps some on-prem service offerings in addition to that? Thank you.
Chuck Robbins

It's just normalization of ordering. We haven't had any lead time pressure at all.
Richard Scott Herren

Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We're not seeing -- what's behind that question, Karl, is the demand that we're seeing today a function of extended lead times like we saw a couple of years ago. That's not the case. Our lead times are not extending.

Hi. It's Adrienne Colby for Atif. Thank you for taking the question. Earlier this week, you announced some offerings geared toward traditional service providers.
I was just wondering if you could help us size this customer segment for Cisco and understand where these customers are in terms of their embrace of AI. What are some of the key issues that Cisco is just helping them address?
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
Scott, do you want to comment on the size of the telco segment for us?
Richard Scott Herren
--
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Overall, telco had a good quarter in the last quarter. That's actually a continuation of what we saw in Q1. And what we hear from telco, particularly in international, is they are in anticipation of demand on their networks driven by AI, doing the same thing that we hear enterprise is doing.
They know there's increased load coming. In many cases, they've sweated those assets some time because of the state of the financials in that industry, and they're coming back to the table to build out their networks in anticipation of the increased demand. I think we'll continue to see that for some period of time, telco by its nature and the size of the telco customers that we have can be a little bit -- episodic a little bit big deals in one quarter and not in the next. So, it's not something that I would expect to see on a steady state, but we're seeing good demand right now.
As they see the same thing, the same trend that enterprises see there's network load coming, we need to be ready for it.
Chuck Robbins
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I think that's right. And I think the other thing that we see some of the European operators are looking at delivering AI as a service. We see a lot of them planning for AI edge applications that are sitting at the edge of their networks that they're managing for customers, etc. So, they are preparing, for sure.

I just want to thank everybody for joining us today, and I want to thank our teams. I'm really proud of these results, and the teams have been doing a really great job, both on the innovation front and engaging with our customers. We clearly live in a very dynamic world. And as Scott said earlier, as the impact of these potential tariffs become more clear, our teams will take the appropriate steps to mitigate where we can.
I do feel good about our momentum. Again, the product innovation and particularly the innovation in our core, the portfolio, and how it's translating through to customer value, clearly, the AI tailwind, as well as the integration that has occurred so far relative to Splunk, and just the team's pure out execution, I'm confident in the steps we've been taking. I think it will lead to durability of the performance, and we want to just continue to deliver for our customers, deliver the right technology, the right value, and be a trusted partner for them. So, thank you for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you soon.

Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I go to our Q1 numbers, I thought I'd take only a moment to review some of the things that you'll be hearing about over the next couple of days from Oracle. We are at CloudWorld in Las Vegas, and CloudWorld is where we come together with our customers and partners, share experiences, and showcase our latest products and services. Our customers are our best spokespeople when they share how our technologies transform their enterprises.
The innovations from our labs and research centers in combination with feedback from our customers have helped us build superior products and services. You'll hear about new cutting-edge features within OCI, Database, Analytics, Fusion, NetSuite, and our industry applications. We will also be showing new capabilities that we've been working on for a while, including embedded AI agents in Fusion and those drive productivity and efficiencies for our customers when they're rolled out. And as an Oracle Fusion customer myself, I take great pride once again in my team's ability to have us announce earnings and give guidance nine days after the quarter ended.
Many, many of our customers ask us how to replicate our results. And at CloudWorld, we will be having a lot of Oracle playbook conversations this week. You've already seen today's announcement of our partnership with Amazon Web Services, which has now joined Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud in making OCI and Oracle available in their respective clouds. Needless to say, we think our multi-cloud strategy will expand the ubiquity and popularity of our differentiated technologies, especially the Oracle Database.
Larry will share more details in just a moment. But now to Q1, which was clearly another outstanding quarter, with total revenue at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share, $0.04 above the high end of guidance. Currency was essentially in line with my guidance. And as usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant-currency growth rates as this is how we manage the business.
Total cloud revenue for SaaS and IaaS was up 22% at $5.6 billion, with SaaS revenue of $3.5 billion, up 10%; and IaaS revenue of $2.2 billion, up 46%, on top of the 64% growth reported last year. As a reminder, we exited the advertising business last quarter, which had the effect of lowering the total cloud applications revenue by 2% this quarter. Total cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.5 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include product support were $4.8 billion and up 7%.
Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenues of $8.2 billion and were up 18%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which include license support, were $5.8 billion and up 14%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 46% and up 49% when you are excluding our legacy hosting services. Our infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of $8.6 billion, OCI consumption revenue was up 56% and demand continued to outstrip supply.
Cloud database services, which were up 23% now have annualized revenues of $2.1 billion. Very importantly, on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, on OCI directly or through our database at cloud services with Azure, Google, and AWS. We expect those cloud database revenues collectively will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic SaaS. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support, were up 4%.
Software license revenues were up 8% to $870 million, including Java, which saw excellent growth. So all in, total revenue for the quarter were $13.3 billion, up 8% from last year. Shifting to gross profit and operating income. The gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q1 as our cloud businesses continue to scale the gross margins of both cloud applications and cloud infrastructure has each been climbing higher.
We continue to display operating expense discipline, Q1 operating income growing 14% and the operating margin was 43%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.9% with non-GAAP EPS at USD 1.39, up 17% in USD, up 18% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was USD 1.03, up 20% in USD and up 22% in constant currency. Including in my guidance at the beginning of the quarter was the expected completion of an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and networking equipment, including an increase of the estimated lives from five years to six years effective at the beginning of this fiscal year.
This change in accounting estimate reduced Q1 operating expenses by about $197 million. At quarter end, we had nearly $11 billion of cash and marketable securities, a short-term deferred revenue balance was $11.5 billion, up 2%. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $7.4 billion, while free cash flow was $5.1 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $19.1 billion and free cash flow was $11.3 billion.
Our remaining performance obligations or RPO is now $99 billion, up 52% in constant currency. Now while we typically see a seasonal decline of RPO in Q1, we signed several large deals this past quarter, resulting in a sequential increase in RPO compared to the decline that we typically see based on our experience over the previous five years. Further, our cloud RPO grew more than 80% and now represents nearly three-fourths of total RPO. And approximately 38% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, which reflects the growing trend of customers wanting the larger and longer contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses.
We spent $2.3 billion on capex this quarter, given the demand that you see in our RPO growth and the additional demand we have and see in our pipeline, I expect the fiscal year 2025 capex will be double what it was in fiscal 2024. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. We now have 85 cloud regions live, another 77 planned with more to follow. We have public cloud regions.
We have dedicated cloud customer regions. We have national security regions. We have sovereign regions. We have Oracle alloy regions with our partners, and we have multi-cloud regions with Azure and Google Cloud and now shortly with AWS as well.
This sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continue to be significant advantages for us in the marketplace. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months.
And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some overarching thoughts and the benefits that I expect they will bring over the coming years. First, the Oracle database is thriving, and the multi-cloud agreements we now have with Microsoft, Google, and AWS make it easier for our customers to run their Oracle databases in the cloud. Second, we are rapidly expanding our OCI capacity to meet the demand that you see in our 52% RPO cloud growth.
Third, while much attention is focused on our GPU-related businesses, our non-GPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our competitors. And finally, our strategic SaaS app continues to grow while we are starting to see more and more of our industry-based cloud apps come online. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher. We will discuss the implications of these positive trends at our financial analyst meeting on Thursday.
For fiscal 2025, we remain very confident and committed to full year total revenue growth growing double digits and full year total cloud infrastructure revenue growing faster than last year. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about a 1% positive effect on total revenue and as much as a $0.03 positive effect on EPS, hard to know for sure. However, the actual currency impact may be different.
Total revenues are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency and are expected to grow between 8% and 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 23% to 25% in constant currency and 24% to 26% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 6% to 10% and be between $1.42 and $1.46 in constant currency, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow from $0.08 to $0.12 and be between USD 1.45 and USD 1.49. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax rate of 19%.
However, one-time tax could cause actual tax rates to vary. And with that, sorry, it was so long. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Thank you, Safra. Today, Oracle has 162 cloud data centers, live and under construction throughout the world. The largest of these data centers is 800 megawatts, and it will contain acres of NVIDIA GP clusters able to train the world's largest AI models. That's what's required to stay competitive in the race to build one, just one of the most powerful artificial neural networks in the world.
The stakes are high and the race goes on. Soon Oracle will begin construction of data centers that are more than a gigawatt. Building giant data centers with ultra-high apartments RDMA networks and huge 32,000-node NVIDIA GPU clusters is something that Oracle has proven to be very good at. It's the reason we're doing so well in the AI training business.
It's important to remember that we first developed those high-performance RDMA networks to interconnect our Exadata CPU cluster hardware that powers our Exadata Database cloud service. The Oracle Database Cloud service running on Exadata and Exascale RDMA clusters, provides an order of magnitude, better performance, better scalability, better reliability, and better security than other databases. And it's still the world's only autonomous, fully self-driving database. Our large and loyal customer base understands and appreciates the many technical advantages of using the Oracle database.
And those customers wanted us to find a way to make the very latest and best Oracle technology available on other clouds in addition to OCI. We found a way. With today's AWS announcement, our customers will be able to use Oracle's latest Exadata and Exascale RDMA clusters with the latest versions of our database software, from within the Microsoft Azure cloud, from within the Google Cloud, and from within the AWS cloud. This will enable customers to use the Oracle database anywhere and everywhere.
That has always worked well for our customers and for our database business. We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come. Back to you.

Questions & Answers:

Thank you. [Operator instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
John Difucci

Analyst
Thank you. Larry and Safra, I mean there's a lot of good stuff here, but I'd like to ask a question on margins. You keep putting up strong cloud numbers, especially the OCI numbers that look when you give the guidance and you look at what you have to do to hit them. They look really difficult to do, to say the least.
We also assume that upside to RPO. And you pointed out, Safra, the sequential increase. I think the last time there were sequential increases because you bought Cerner and it just added RPO because of that. I assume a big part of that OCI too.
You mentioned it's cloud, three-quarters of it. So that indicates there's more to come, right? So given the mix of business continuing to lean into that lower margin OCI, and I know you have that's changing over time, but it's still lower margin today. How should we think of overall margins versus profit for the entire company going forward?
Safra Ada Catz
--
Chief Executive Officer
OK. Let me start with this and maybe then Larry can add on. So first of all, I want to remind you that that -- remember that third leg of the stool I mentioned, which is our database and autonomous database, that is also part of OCI. And that is beginning to really expand.
And our multi-cloud agreements, again, will help OCI gross margins so that you know gross margins even this quarter as the percentage increased, regardless of the fact that we have a lot more OCI, and so our business is really only now starting to get real scale. And we have built OCI in a way and Larry can really expand on it, where it is extremely automated. The management of it is very automated. And our whole rollout as it grows, we make more money.
And as much as percentages are great, and again, our operating margin percentages continue to increase. and OCI includes not only base storage and compute and GPUs, but it also includes a lot of other capabilities, including the database, which have excellent margins, too. And of course, as you mentioned, our SaaS business, again, an excellent and at-scale business, even that business benefits from our expansion in OCI. And once again, even at its high margins continued to improve this past quarter.
Larry, I don't know if you want to.
Lawrence Joseph Ellison

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
I'd like to. So let's start with SaaS. As we go to Autonomous database, we get tremendous efficiencies. We're moving Fusion and NetSuite to Autonomous database as we speak.
We've decided everything needs to move to autonomous for two reasons really. First reason, when you have a completely autonomous database, there is no -- the DBA, the database administrator is a robot. There is no human labor associated with managing the Oracle Autonomous Database. Now OK, that's obviously a cost savings.
But more importantly, with no human labor, there's no human error. It's a huge security advantage we have over our competitors. There's no mistakes to be made. There's no human labor.
It's all automated. And the potential -- when you have everything completely automated, and it's also truly elastic. I'm not going to go into exactly what that means. But it means that you've got a running that certainly needs 500 microprocessors, you get those 500 for the three minutes you need it, and then you return them to the pool.
So that's very different than how other databases work, which they may call -- the cloud itself may be elastic in places, but their databases are typically not elastic. Autonomous is. So we use a lot less hardware. It's a lot faster.
It's a lot more efficient. It's fully automated, no human labor, much more secure. And the margins for the autonomous database business is much higher or much higher than the traditional Oracle business. And I think those margins are -- I mean, they're stunningly high.
Around the same margins as a which are also stunningly hard margin because SaaS runs primarily on that autonomous database. So we use hardware very efficiently. We use labor sparingly because labor is a security risk. When people are actually doing things manually, it's a security risk, and it slows down our ability to expand.
Every Oracle data center from the largest to the smallest are identical in features and functions, they only vary by scale. That means we have one suite of automation software that automates all of this. Nobody else does this. No one has that level of automation, that level of autonomy.
It allows us to get much better margins in our database business and our SaaS business and the rest of our cloud business. Our clouds are more automated, so we have very low labor costs. Our networks are much more efficient, the RDMA networks run so much faster. If you run twice as fast, our costs go down by half.
And our networks are much faster than the other clouds. So we think our potential as we scale our potential to deliver much better margins than we're currently delivering is very real.
John Difucci

Analyst
So is it safe for me to assume that then the upside you keep putting up and you hopefully will continue to do, will add profit, and that profit will actually increase as a percentage of the margins will also increase over time?
Lawrence Joseph Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
I believe so. And I believe, for example, I mean I think you'd find different points of view from different engineers as we move Fusion to Autonomous Database. I think the cost savings -- our cloud cost savings will be around 50%. That's what I believe.
Now it might be 40%, it might be 35%, but there will be huge cost savings from where we are now, and that's across the entire base of Fusion customers. So that's just one example of how we're using faster networks, faster databases, more automation to make our products more secure. And I keep emphasizing that security is really the primary goal. But as a second-order effect, we also end up spending a lot less money to run those data centers.

Thank you very much and congrats on the great performance. Larry, how do you envision the market transitioning from the AI training phase to the AI inferencing phase? There's some debate out there on whether we have an imbalance or a bubble on the front end of the curve because training is compute-intensive and then perhaps it recalibrates differently somehow for the inferencing stage, which might be less intensive? Or do you see the potential for high growth kind of all the way through both of these phases?
Lawrence Joseph Ellison

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Well, a lot of people think that, my God, I send a kid to college and then I'm done. They're training ever. I got four years of training, and then I can put the kid to work and they'll be doing inferencing. And that's not true.
This race goes on forever, to build a better and better neural network. And the cost of that training gets to be astronomical. When I talk about building gigawatt or multi-gigawatt data centers, I mean these AI models, these frontier models are going to -- the entry price for a real frontier model from someone who wants to compete in that area is around $100 billion. Let me repeat, around $100 billion.
That's over the next four or five years for anyone who wants to play in that game. That's a lot of money. And it doesn't get easier. So there are not going to be a lot of those.
I mean, this is not the place on the list of who can actually build one of these frontier models. But in addition to that, there are going to be a lot of very, very specialized models. I can tell you things that I'm personally involved in, which are using computers to look at, biopsies of slides or CAT scans to discover cancer. Also, there are also blood tests we're doing for discovering cancer.
Those tend to be very specialized models. Those tend not necessarily to use the foundational -- the Groks, the ChatGPTs and the Llamas and the Geminis. They tend to be highly specialized models, trained on image recognition on certain data, I mean, literally millions of biopsy slides, for example, and not much other training data is helpful. So that goes on, and we'll see more and more applications like that.
So, if your horizon is over the next five years, maybe even the next 10 years, I wouldn't worry about, hey, we've now trained all the models we need and all we need to do is inferencing. I think this is an ongoing battle for technical supremacy that will be fought by a handful of companies and maybe one nation-state over the next five years at least, but probably more like 10. So this business is just growing larger and larger and larger. There's no slowdown or shift coming.
Let me say something that's going to sound really bizarre. Well, you'd probably say, well, he says bizarre things all the time. So why is he announcing this one? Let's be really bizarre. So we're in the middle of designing a data center that's north of the gigawatt that has -- but we found the location and the power place.
We've looked at it, they've already got building permits for three nuclear reactors. These are the small modular nuclear reactors to power the data center. This is how crazy it's getting. This is what's going on.

Hey, thank you. Just a question more on the database side on the agreements that you just announced today or that you have in place and now added with AWS. So now that we have all the hyperscaler agreements in place, how do you think about that migration movements from database workloads that are at the moment running on-premise or on cloud customers to the public cloud? I mean how should we think about that momentum? Thank you.
Safra Ada Catz

Chief Executive Officer
You think it's going to accelerate. basically -- no, you go ahead, Larry.
Lawrence Joseph Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
No, no, no. I think you're right. Well, there's two things. Public cloud is very interesting, and it's very important.
I mean I mean Oracle became very successful in the database business just a long time ago because one of our watchwords was portability. We ran an IBM mainframes. We ran on Microsoft PCs. We ran on Hewlett-Packard machines.
And if you remember them, digital equipment machines and all sorts of computers, we ran everywhere. And that was very important to our customers could run the Oracle database in any environment. And it's obviously -- and we had to find a way to actually make the best versions of our database, the Exadata, Exascale versions of our database available in other people's clouds. And what we're able to do is basically get OCI small enough that we could embed an OCI data center within Microsoft Azure or an OCI data center within Google or AWS or wherever we had to put it.
It could be fully autonomous, where we could use Exadata and Exascale clusters. We actually were able to do that. It was not technically easy, but we did it. In doing that and miniaturizing our Oracle data centers, one is I mentioned earlier that all of our data centers are the same except in scale.
The biggest one is 800 gigawatts right now, bordering getting close to 800 megawatts, excuse me, we're getting close to 1 gigawatt. The smallest is about 150 kilowatts, and we're going to get down to 50 kilowatts. What that means is we'll have a lot of companies, even medium, large-sized companies that will decide to have an Oracle private cloud. I mean, it's still -- there's no difference between our private cloud and the public cloud.
They are identical. They're absolutely identical. And a bunch of people have Oracle -- have a private cloud, a bunch of industrial companies. Vodafone has Oracle private clouds, for example, to run their workloads.
But they're becoming so inexpensive that anyone can decide, OK, I want to move to the cloud. I want all the advantages in the cloud, but I want to make sure that I'm the only one in the cloud. I don't want any neighbors or I want only approved neighbors. I don't want someone with a credit card moving in.
I'm just paranoid about security where I've got government regulations I have to adhere to. So we think that obviously, moving with Oracle database available in AWS, Microsoft, and Google is incredibly important. And Safra said it. I mean it will absolutely accelerate database growth in the public cloud.
But we expect that private clouds will greatly outnumber public clouds as companies decide they don't want it. They want the Oracle Cloud behind their firewall in their data center with no neighbors. And because we've gotten our data center -- our data centers are so automated and they're scalable, and they're all identical in terms of function, we're organized. Actually, we have 162 data centers now.
I expect we will have 1,000 or 2,000 or more data centers -- Oracle cloud data centers around the world, and a lot of them will be dedicated to individual banks or telecommunications companies or technology companies or what have you, or nation states, sovereign clouds, all of this other stuff. It's hard for me to predict whether the private cloud or the public cloud, which is going to be bigger. I don't know. The good news is we win either way.

Thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter. Very impressive both the quarter and the guide. We've seen a lot of focus on the model training side, but less on applications and inferencing in the rest. You guys have a lot of expertise in the market and in the industry.
You already have traditional AI sprinkled throughout all the Oracle products and capabilities. But where do you see the monetizable value of GenAI on the app side? How long do you think it's going to take for GenAI to be a meaningful revenue, not just for Oracle, but software in general, on the app side, not on the training side? Thank you.

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Well, let me -- I'm sorry, I'm monopolizing these answers. I apologize. But let me start with healthcare from everything from us helping doctors diagnose different diseases. When someone goes in to get a sonogram, and I've seen the nurses and the technicians and the doctors actually measure the baby skull and measure the baby's spinal cord to see how the baby -- it's utterly ridiculous.
The computer should do all of that. And if there's an umbilical wrapped around the fetus' neck, the computer should discover all of that, and that it should all be recorded. The doctor should get assistance from a computer doing all of this stuff, looking at the plaque and coronary arteries. All should be done that way.
Already, we've delivered when a doctor gets ready to vision to a patient, we prepare a summary for the doctor. We use AI to look at the electronic health records the latest labs that might've been finished just a few hours ago. And let the doctor know whether there's stability or disease progression or whatever the doctor needs to know prior to the consultation with the patient. That summary is created by AI, human-readable summary.
Then AI listens to the consultation between the doctor and the patient. This is already delivered. This is already out there. They'll listen to the consultation of doctors with the patient.
If the doctor orders a prescription, the AI checks to make sure the prescription is accurate and enters the prescription. The AI updates the electronic health records. The AI transcribes and distributes the doctors' orders, all from listening to the conversation. The doctor then gets a draft at the end of the conversation that the doctor can quickly review and approve.
And then the prescriptions are filled and the orders are executed and the electronic health records are updated. We're already doing all of that. But I can go on in healthcare needs so many things from reading of X-rays to just the user interface. Our user interface is so different than Epic.
I was at Stanford with my son at one time and to three people, three different positions to actually be able to find his X-rays. This is how you find the X-rays for Larry Ellison. You say, Oracle, please show me Larry Ellison's latest X-ray. It's a voice interface.
You just ask for them. How do you log on? Well, you look at the computer and it recognizes your face. It recognizes your voice, that knows you're the doctor and you're authorized to look at that, all the authorization is done with AI. When are we going to start monetizing it? Well, all of Cerner is the monetization.
The fact that we can dramatically expand our health business is because it's based on AI. AI is just -- I don't know how to describe it. I mean the best way to describe it. It's not something you sell separately.
It's the diagnostic system. It's the electronic health record system. The pharmacy system, this prescription system, the user authentication, the log-in system, it's all AI. And I know people think it's a separate thing that, ""Oh my God."" And I hear a bunch of applications companies say, ""Oh, we've now got AI agents.
We'll charge for it separately."" I mean, our applications are going to be primarily AI applications, everything. How do you charge separately for everything? I really don't -- I find it bewildering when I listen to them talk. I don't understand what they're saying. I'll stop there.

Great, thanks. And I'll echo my congratulations. Safra, Larry, you guys have had this big inflection in RPO growth over the last few quarters. Could you update us on how you're feeling about supply availability and your ability to stand up data center infrastructure in a time-efficient manner in order to move from contract signing to consumption and convert backlog into revenue? And I guess, are you doing anything different today than, say, a year ago to try and help accelerate these timelines?
Safra Ada Catz
--
Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'm going to start and Larry can finish. So we have enormous demand that is absolutely true. And I will say that demand is still outstripping supply.
But I can live with that because we are laying out a lot of supply. As you can see, in the revenues and you can see that in the guidance and my commitment for this next year, and we'll be talking about beyond on Thursday of Financial Analyst Day. We have made a number of changes, including what Larry mentioned earlier, which is the automation of the setting up and laying down our data centers. However, because demand is so large, we do have to get in different places.
As I told you I don't know. A couple of quarters ago, we made the decision instead of picking up small pieces to actually wait in some cases, to pick up larger locations. And that is really playing out very, very well for us. But we are really moving and growing in so many places because it's not only public cloud rollouts, but it is also private clouds, which are in immense demand, national security regions, immense demand.
And really, we are moving as fast as we can, and automation is the thing that has helped us lay this out. And the fact that we have everything everywhere means nothing is unique. Everything is the same, and that cannot be set by our competitors, and that helps us in our rollouts.
Lawrence Joseph Ellison

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
I just want to emphasize what Safra just said. Our private clouds are identical to our public clouds, except for the fact they might only have one tenant, and it might be in a building that you own. Besides that, they're identical. We own the hardware.
We manage the hardware for you. It just happens to be in a building you own, and you're the only one that can get in. So that's a very different situation than all of our competitors, and it's fully automated. So we're prepared to manage thousands of data centers.
By the way, I would compare that to Elon Musk's Starlink, where he's got, I think, close to 7,000 satellites in the sky now. It's 6,800. How do you manage -- these satellites constantly maneuver. They not geosynchronous satellites.
Their low earth orbiting satellites. So they're constantly flying around and changing location. How do you manage 7,000 spacecraft flying around? Well, let me tell you, computers, it's got to be fully automated or it's not going to work. You can't have thousands even hundreds, I would say, data centers, you can't have.
But you certainly can have thousands of data centers unless they're fully automated. And the only way you can automate something is to make them all the same. You can't automate 25 different things. So that's one thing.
The other thing I'll point out, and I think it's interesting about Oracle, that some of the most senior people in our management team are experts in building, buildings, building electric power plants and electric transmission systems. Because building these data centers is just that. You can't just build a data center. You also have to account for the energy and the transmission of the energy from where it's generated to the data center.
And of course, the most efficient way to do this is actually build the generation -- the power generation plant right next to the data center. So you transmit over the shortest distance. And we actually have very senior people who are very -- actually come from the utilities industry as strange as that sounds, that are expert in doing this and helping us build these gigantic projects. Again, I'll harken to Elon Musk.
One of the hardest jobs he had in building Tesla was when he built the Austin plant, he had to build the largest building ever built by humankind anywhere at any time. And then he want to know the largest building ever built. It certainly is not the Pentagon. It's not the NASA building for the space shuttle.
Largest building is the Tesla plant. And so you have to be the contractor of that plant. You have to be able to build those things and then fill it with robots that then build your cars. So you got to build the building, get the power, and build all the automation systems, which is the hardest part about building the cloud or building automation system, build all the automation systems, so it works efficiently and reliably, and cost-effectively.
And we have some really interesting people here with a very different experience base than we had even five years ago.

Your final question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brad Zelnick
--
Analyst
Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. And I'll just start by saying I can't remember a Q1 ever being this exciting. Larry, we've talked about a lot of the reasons why you win in cloud infrastructure, especially by addressing areas of the market where your competitors can't even reach.
But in light of many high-profile cyber incidents lately, can you talk about how being more secure, not just in being so highly automated as you've already discussed, but how is it being more secure, helping to win some of these very large OCI deals, especially in the U.S. and other governments around the world? Thank you.
Lawrence Joseph Ellison

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Well, I couldn't thank you more for the question because I have two things I'm talking about a CloudWorld on Tuesday. One is multi-cloud and the other is security. And let me announce right here, we're done with passwords. The idea is utterly ridiculous.
They're easily hacked. The more difficult they are to remember, the more likely you are to write them down, the more likely they are to be stolen. Everything done to make passwords better has made them worse. It's a terrible idea.
So we're getting rid of passwords entirely. This is the way log on is going to work. I'm going to type in larry.ellisonoracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, ""OK, Larry, we're done. Why would I type in Safra can recognize me.
My kids can recognize me. You're telling me the computer can't recognize me in and log me in? This is ridiculous. So we're not -- no more passwords. Those have got to go.
There are other things we can do to secure network communications, and we have this new technology actually goes live in our cloud this week called Zipper, it's called Zero Trust Packet Routing, that I'll be talking about. And it guarantees the -- while biometric authentication will guarantee that you are who you say you are when you log in. So, we'll know so users -- fraudulent users will find it very difficult to infiltrate our systems with biometric authentication. And by the way, there are keys on the keyboard that will look at your fingerprint.
It depends on how -- if you want face recognition plus fingerprints, all voluntary. You don't have to do it if you don't want to. But certainly a whole bunch of people prefer biometric authentication. That's why Google Pay is popular and Apple Pay is popular.
So it's from my convenience. I don't want to remember passwords. Look at me and recognize me and log them in. Don't ask me to type in some stupid 17 letter password, that someone can steal.
There is that. The Zero Trust packet routing actually authenticates you from the user all the way to the data. And we've greatly simplified network security by separating it from network configuration. That's another thing I'm going to talk about.
But by the way, let me go back to automation. Automation is more of a security issue than it is an efficiency issue. Automated cars, self-driving cars will kill a lot fewer people every year than human drivers. They don't get drunk.
They don't go 135 miles an hour. Automation is a safety issue and a security issue. Almost all cyberattacks begin the same way with human error. If there is no Oracle database administrator as there isn't with the autonomous database, the DBA cannot make a configuration mistake that exposes your data.
you can't have a human being involved if you want to make your data secure. Autonomy is a huge portion of it. And the fourth piece of security that I'll talk about is code generation. When you generate a computer program rather than hand write it in Java, hey, we're the owners of Java or I don't know.
Maybe the Supreme Court said we're not the owners of Java. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what it even means. I'm not a lawyer.
But if the computer generates the program rather than a human being writing it, the computer will not generate security vulnerabilities. They will not generate something called state which means your application can't fail over automatically in case your data center loses power or burns down or something like that. Code generation is a huge portion of next-generation security. Zero trust packet routing is another important one biometric authentication and automation are the four key attributes to winning the cyber war.
It's going to be our defensive robots against their robots, and we have to have better technology on the defensive side than they currently have on the offensive side because they are winning. I mean every year, there's more successful cyberattacks. And you know what the FBI says when you're attacked, ""Pay the ransom. There's nothing we can do about it."" Well, that's not very encouraging.
I have an idea. Let's keep the ransom money, but implement next-generation technology that makes it much harder for cybercriminals. And by the way -- and it's not so bad with cyber criminals now compared to what state actors have the ability to do. So we have to harden our computer systems.
We have to make them more secure. The good news is there is a whole new generation of AI-based security systems like biometric authentication, like zero-trust packet routing that we can use to stop these attacks, but we have to actually deploy the technology.

Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was another excellent quarter with total revenue at the high end of my constant currency guidance, and EPS was actually $0.01 above the high end. These results are being driven by the fact that our largest revenue component, cloud services and license support, now represents 77% of total revenue and is also our fastest-growing line item, which, in turn, is driving the acceleration of overall revenue growth. We expect cloud revenue to reach $25 billion this fiscal year.
This is happening for several reasons. First, our cloud is faster and thus less expensive than other clouds. We remain the preferred cloud for AI workloads, as well as for non-GPU cloud infrastructure services. In addition, our ability to deploy our cloud in many sizes gives our customers flexibility.
And our multi-cloud agreements with Microsoft, Google, and AWS provide customers more choice in how they can migrate their Oracle databases to the cloud. And our strategic SaaS applications continue to grow rapidly. And we are also seeing more of our industry-based cloud applications come online, which immediately contribute to revenue growth. You can see all of this in the momentum in the acceleration of our cloud growth and the 50% growth of our $97 billion RPO number, remaining performance obligation.
And today, we're telling you again that revenue growth will accelerate further in the coming quarters. Turning to Q2, and I want to remind you that our quarter ended on Saturday a week ago, and here we are announcing our results. And that's only possible because we use Oracle Fusion. Now, as for the numbers, we saw all segments exceeding our internal forecast.
Now, as the dollar strengthened in the quarter, the 1% currency benefit for total revenue and the $0.02 to $0.03 benefit for EPS that were present in my August guidance retreated with total revenue and EPS in Q2 essentially unaffected by currency movements. As usual, as I go over things today, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rate, as this is how we manage the business. So, here it goes. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS and IaaS, was up 24% at 5.9 billion, with SaaS revenue of 3.5 billion, up 10%, and IaaS revenue of 2.4 billion, up 52% on top of the 50% growth reported last year.
As a reminder, we exited the advertising business last quarter, which had the effect of lowering the total cloud revenue growth by 2% this quarter. Total cloud services and license support for the quarter was 10.8 billion, up 12%, driven again by OCI, our strategic cloud application, and autonomous database. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were 6 billion, up 17%. Record level AI demand drove Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue up 52%.
But excluding legacy hosting infrastructure cloud services, revenue was up 55%. Our infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of 9.7 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 58% as demand continues to outstrip supply. Growth in the AI segment of our infrastructure business was extraordinary.
GPU consumption was up 336% in the quarter, and we delivered the world's largest and fastest AI supercomputer, scaling up to 65,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs. Cloud database services, which were up 28% and now have an annualized revenue of 2.2 billion, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud on OCI, either directly or through our database at cloud services with Azure, Google, and AWS, we expect the cloud database revenues collectively will be the third leg of revenue growth, alongside OCI and strategic staff. We currently -- we are currently live in 17 cloud regions with database at cloud services and have another 35 planned with Azure, Google and AWS. Database subscription services, which includes database license support, were up 5%.
Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were 4.8 billion and up 7%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of 8.4 billion, and were up 18%. Software license revenues were up 3% to 1.2 billion, including Java, which saw excellent growth. So, all-in, total revenues for the quarter were 14.1 billion, up 9% from last year.
Now, shifting to gross profit and operating income, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q2. As our cloud businesses continue to scale, the gross margins of both cloud applications and cloud infrastructure have each been trending higher. We continue to display expense discipline, which, of course, we're known for, especially with R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses, which collectively continue to grow slower than revenue, a trend that I expect to continue. The Q2 operating income grew 10%, and the operating margin was 43%, up 60 basis points from last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was actually 20.1%, which is higher than my 19% guidance. Even as higher tax rate lowered EPS by $0.02, we still hit the high end of my constant currency guidance. Absolutely, we did better. The non-GAAP EPS was $1.47, up 10% in USD and 10% in constant currency.
The GAAP EPS was $1.10, and that's up 24% in USD and 23% in constant currency. At quarter-end, we had 11.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was 9.4 billion, up 8%. With capex at 4 billion for the quarter, free cash flow was negative 2.7 billion, and operating cash flow was positive $1.3 billion.
Given the demand that you see in our RPO numbers and the additional demand we see in our pipeline, I expect fiscal year 2025 capex will be double what it was in fiscal year FY '24. As always, we remain careful to pace and align our capex investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was up 19% at 20.3 billion, and free cash flow was 9.5 billion. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now at 97.3 billion, up 50% in constant currency and reflects the growing trend of customers and longer contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses.
Further, our cloud RPO grew nearly 80% and now represents nearly three-fourth of total RPO. Approximately 39% of the total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, and we continue to see the growth of current RPO accelerate. We have now about 98 cloud regions live and many, many more to follow. That we have more cloud regions than any of the other hyperscalers reflects the strategic of our Gen 2 architecture.
We can start a new cloud region with a handful of racks and then scale up with customer demand. Additionally, our data centers are highly automated and identical in features and function varying only in scale. This sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud region continue to be a significant advantage for us. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and in dividend.
This quarter, we repurchased nearly a million shares for a total of 150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of 4.4 billion over the last 12 months. And the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Before I dive into specific Q3 guides, I'd like to share some overarching thoughts about the financial benefits I expect we will see over the coming quarters and years.
To start, we continue to see excellent demand for our cloud services, which you see in our RPO growth. And while this growth is stellar, our pipeline is actually growing even faster. And our win rates are growing higher with the recent win at Meta being a prime example of why we expect that our RPO balance will climb again in Q3. Meta was not booked in the Q2 quarter, only in Q3.
In fiscal year 2024, we signed some big deals, and many have begun to generate revenue. We expect that those will continue to ramp higher in the second half and be a key contributor to revenue growth acceleration this year and next. For fiscal year 2025, we remain very confident and committed to full year total revenue growing double digit and full year total cloud infrastructure growing faster than the 50% reported last year. OK, let me now turn to guidance, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis.
In terms of currency, we've seen a dramatic shift due to significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar. To put this in perspective, in Q2, we expected currency to have a $0.03 positive effect on EPS for Q3, assuming exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a $0.03 negative effect on EPS and a 2% negative effect on revenue.
However, as the dollar strengthens, it may not hold out the whole quarter and may be different. All right. Total revenue are expected to grow from 9% to 11% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in USD at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 25% to 27% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 23% to 25% in USD.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 7% to 9% and be between $1.50 and $1.54 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% to 6% and be between $1.47 and $1.41 in USD. I should mention that my Q3 EPS guidance is negatively impacted by a $0.05 -- by $0.05 due to an investment loss in another company that we are partial owner of. Lastly, my EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%.
However, like in Q2, one-time tax events and other things can cause actual tax rates to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.

Thank you, Safra. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models. Our major AI customers include OpenAI, xAI, Nvidia, Cohere, and most recently, Meta with their large scale Llama models. Oracle continues to win large AI training workloads because we're faster and less expensive than the other infrastructure clouds.
And we just extended our AI performance advantage by delivering the largest and fastest AI supercomputer in the world, scaling up to 65,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs. The Oracle Cloud trains dozens of AI models and embeds hundreds of AI agents in cloud applications. Oracle's AI agents automate drug design, image and genomic analysis for cancer diagnostics, audio updates to electronic health records for patient care, satellite image analysis to predict and improve agricultural output, fraud and money laundering detection, dual factor biometric computer logins, and real-time video weapons detection in schools. Furthermore, the better capabilities of the new AI version of our database, Oracle 23ai, enables our customers to easily use their existing data in their existing databases to augment and specialize the training of industry-standard generative AI models like ChatGPT, Grok, and Llama.
The Oracle Cloud and the Oracle 23ai vector database makes it easy for our customers to build their own AI agents and use their own data to reap the benefits of the AI revolution. Oracle is training AI models and developing AI agents that will improve the rate of scientific discovery and economic development and corporate growth throughout the world. The scale of this opportunity is unimaginable. As Safra said, this fiscal year, total Oracle Cloud revenue should top $25 billion.
And this is just the beginning of the beginning. Back to you.

Thank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. I'd like to gain better insight into OCI. OCI is designed differently from its larger peers, deliverable in just 10 and shortly three racks of servers. Can you explain how the architectural difference impacts how you build and deliver OCI racks and how it will impact how many data center regions you could have compared to your peers? And then, how might this affect your capex growth over the next five years? Thanks.
Larry Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
OK, well, all the data centers are the same racks. So, you can think of it as completely modular. We have a basic rack. And to build a region takes six racks, the smallest region we can build.
So, our racks, you know, start at, you know, under 50 kilowatts. And our biggest data center -- so, excuse me, so our basic small data centers, you know, 50 kilowatts. And our data center is -- the largest data center we're currently building now is 1.6 gigawatts. So, that's quite a range, you know, 50 megawatts to 1.6 gigawatts.
And when we build them and we put them in inventory, the racks are pretty much the same. So, it's very easy for us to manufacture these. It's lower cost to manufacture these. The inventory is less because they're all kind of the same.
Furthermore, every cloud region has all of our services. They have all the same services so it's easy for customers. We don't have to provision like our competitors do. Our competitors have some of their services in some regions and some of their services in other regions.
We have all of our services in all of our regions, even though we are both smaller in terms of our smallest region and larger in terms of our largest region than our competitors. When all of our racks are the same and all of our services are the same, they become very easy, or, I should say, easier to automate. They're all identical. We have one suite of automation tools that works in all hundred of our current regions.
And it makes it possible because of the high degree of automation to run not dozens of regions, but hundreds or even, theoretically, thousands of regions, as individual customers are dedicating their own region. Individual customers are buying complete Oracle regions and installing them if you -- what seems like it would be on-premise, though, it is a full Oracle Cloud region just happened to be in a dedicated data center to that customer. We are selling a lot of those as well. So, it allows us to address a market that our competitors can't reach.
So, standardization, automation, and, from the smallest to the largest data centers, give us a huge advantage in competing in this marketplace.
Safra Ada Catz

On the capex side, what we can do since our competitors always have to land with extremely large footprints before they can even get started, we can land with smaller footprints, have consumption, and expand as customers need it. And this allows us to really match our capital expenditure with ultimately our revenue because it only -- we don't have to spend a long time with empty centers because we literally can start small and just fill them up as our customers are consuming. And I think this is really something that is expressed also in the profitability of our cloud and keeps showing up because of that.

Thanks for taking my question. It's impressive to see OCI growth 52% and even database as a service up 28%. So, as you execute on your multi-cloud strategy, can you provide some color on the database migration to cloud or even database as a service traction? And what are you hearing from customers as they prepare to migrate on-prem database to cloud? And how should we think about the contribution to revenue going forward?

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer

Safra Ada Catz

Chief Executive Officer
All right, let me start. As I mentioned, you know, and as you caught in my talking, 28%, it's now annualized revenue, just the cloud database services, of $2.2 billion. And imagine, most -- that is mostly, nearly entirely OCI without even the database at AWS and Azure and Google. That also though has grown from zero to, you know, 100 million-plus run rate already, past 100 million, and will be hundreds of millions probably as an exit.
So, these cloud regions have only started opening. As I mentioned, though, we do now have 17 open and twice as many opening. So, I think what you're going to see is the database, as it moves to the cloud, is really only at the beginning. In addition, though, I want to remind you that cloud customers and our Alloy partners are also contributing to this.
And we have an enormous pipeline of customers who want to bring their databases to the cloud. But a number of them want to do it in their own dedicated regions that are just their own for either regulatory reasons or sovereignty reasons, again, an offering that only we have that none of our competitors have.
Larry Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Yeah, again, Microsoft is the only partner where the contract is more than a year old. So, Google is much more recent, and AWS, even more recent than Google. So, we're at the very beginning of multi-cloud. And as Safra said, it's going to exit well over $100 million in its first year.
The first year is starting when we got AWS, when we had all three. It will be a multibillion dollar business, and it'll be a combination of AWS and Google and Azure, plus all of these Cloud@Customer, Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer. We're going to have hundreds of those regions. We -- the demand for -- from individual customers, large banks, telecommunication companies, building half a dozen or so data centers.
They want us to build a half a dozen data centers, sometimes more, inside their own dedicated facilities. So, they'll run the Oracle Cloud in dedicated regions. And again, we'll end up with hundreds of those. And it clearly is going to be a multi -- very large, rapidly growing multibillion dollar business for us..

Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brad Zelnick

Analyst
Great. Thank you, and congrats on the continued acceleration at scale. Larry, as Oracle leads with larger and larger GPU clusters, there's healthy industry debate around scaling laws, with Elon Musk allegedly pushing the envelope of what's possible. I'm curious to hear your perspective as to whether there's diminishing returns on the amount of compute thrown at model training in Oracle's ongoing leadership in AI infrastructure and GPU super clusters.
Thanks.
Larry Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Well, there's two elements to speeding up training. One is building larger and larger GPU clusters made up of faster and faster GPUs. So, it's a GPU cluster itself. The second element, something Oracle has been very, very focused on, is building networks that rapidly move large volumes of data into those GPU clusters.
As you make these GPU clusters larger and faster, it's putting more and more demands on the network to be able to move huge amounts of data into those GPU clusters so that GPU clusters aren't sitting there waiting for the data. If they're sitting there waiting for the data, it becomes very inefficient. If you're paying by the minute and half the time, half of 30 seconds, you don't have the data available. Obviously, that's a scaling problem.
And that's an economic problem, and that's a performance problem. Oracle differentiates itself in its data centers by investing heavily in building networks and, by the way, switch software, all sorts of network software and network hardware to move data more quickly. We think we'll be able -- the demand is really -- as the GPU clusters get bigger and faster, the demand -- the critical thing is for us to be able to move the data faster. And we are investing heavily in that, and we think we're going to maintain our advantage there.
And that will -- as we make our networks faster, the AI training will get faster. If we don't -- if no one makes the networking faster, then I think there's a potential bottleneck. But we're trying to, you know, avoid that bottleneck by speeding up our networking.

Raimo Lenschow

Perfect. Thank you. Can I shift gear a little bit and go back to the SaaS part of the business? If you look there, if you look at your growth rates, I mean, we're at kind of a late-stage point of the cycle where people usually don't look at their back office systems. But you guys are putting up like really solid growth numbers there.
You're outgrowing your peers. Can you talk a little bit of what's going on there? Thank you.
Safra Ada Catz
--
Chief Executive Officer
Actually, I don't agree with you that folks aren't looking at their back office systems. In fact, I think there's enormous amount of pressure to be more efficient for many companies. The competition is fierce in -- almost in basically all industries right now. And as companies, when they look at us, for example, that's why I always point out that it's -- what is it? Day nine? And that includes three weekends -- three weekend days since our quarter closed.
That just shows how efficient you can be in running your operation. And a lot of company executives actually come up to me and say, ""We need to do that. We need to do more and spend a lot less doing it."" And we see enormous -- really enormous pipeline in customers who understand that they can, first, automate and simplify their own businesses to spend less so they can invest in the things that differentiate them. But there's also enormous interest in using their data for AI and using those systems.
We have, I don't know, dozens and dozens of AI agents that can really help companies spend a lot less and really do a better job serving their customers. So, we find enormous interest in this area. And no one has the capability and the data and the AI capability that Oracle can bring to a customer. So, actually, I think it's been one of the most exciting times in back office and in front office, too.
We have -- even our front office systems also taking advantage of so many of our capabilities for our customers. So, this has been a great time. And in fact, our booking trends, which you don't see yet in revenues because we wait until they're implemented, our booking trends have taken a marked step-up. We were going over those just today, and they've accelerated from last year quite significantly.

Kirk Materne

Analyst
Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the results. Safra, you talked a little bit about the pipeline strength at the end of your prepared comments. Can you just talk about your line of sight in terms of capacity coming online so that you all can recognize some of the revenue that's associated with the demand that you're seeing, you know, specifically around on the OCI side? Thanks.
Safra Ada Catz
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yes, so the second half of this year is -- and especially -- well, the second half, we're in it, is going to see a lot of capacity come online that we've been waiting for and that we've been working on. So, we expect that you're going to see that turning into revenues. This is -- everything's accelerating even more. And in addition, though, we also expect our RPO to start moving up the actual base RPO number, which is, of course, up 50% year over year, but the number itself, we expect it to spike in this quarter and for the end of the year.
So, we expect both capacity to come online for our customers, which it is, and so it'll burn down some of our RPO. But we also simultaneously expect to sign a number of very large contracts to -- that will make our RPO number go up, too.

Thank you. Safra, you've shown us -- I'm going to switch gears a little bit and go down to the bottom line here versus the top line. You've shown us for years that Oracle's not going to do what I'll call empty business that you don't make good profit on. It's been a while, but you've previously said that OCI gross margins have improved consistently.
And I think you just mentioned it again in your prepared remarks. And I think the last time you actually threw out a number was a while ago, but it was in the low 30s for gross margins for OCI. And that was several quarters ago. Can you give us an update on the progress of that, especially given the massive growth you're seeing?
Safra Ada Catz
--
Chief Executive Officer
It's really amazing, but we are continuing to benefit from a number of things in OCI. So, our gross margin percentage continues to improve. And I know that many of you think that GPU business or OCI-based infrastructure business, it is not as profitable, and yet, our margins in that business just continue to improve because of the number of things that Larry mentioned. For example, the way we run our cloud, the way we set up our cloud, everything's automated, everything is run.
Because we are a software company to the core, we're always optimizing our software capabilities, which gives us really enormous leverage. The -- our operating margins in OCI again improved, and it's just going to -- you know, it's been really fantastic. So, they improve in OCI, our SAS margins improve, everything is improving with scale for us, even in -- even as we're investing. So, we just -- it just continues to improve.

Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, this was our strongest booking quarter ever by a huge margin as we added $48 billion to our backlog. Our RPO balance is now 130 billion, up from 97 billion last quarter and up from 80 billion last year. That's a growth of 63% year over year, and this does not include any contracts with Project Stargate.
The RPO figure is the leading indicator of demand for our cloud services, while our live data center count and power capacity is the leading indicator of the conversion of RPO to revenue. Speaking of data centers, we marked a milestone this quarter as we crossed into triple digits with our 101st cloud region coming online. It's just a matter of time before we have more cloud regions than all of our competitors combined, reflecting the strategic advantage of our Gen 2 architecture which offers our customers the most flexibility. From a delivery standpoint, the growth of our power capacity under contract is even higher than the growth in the number of data centers.
And we expect that our available power capacity will double this calendar year and triple by the end of next fiscal year. As we bring more capacity online, our revenues will clearly accelerate. What we are seeing in the market is that we are the destination of choice for both AI training and inferencing. This is due to the fact that our Gen 2 cloud is faster and, therefore, cheaper than our competitors and also due to our ultra high-speed networking engineering that we started decades ago and that is now highly relevant for AI.
Taken together, we have numerous structural engineering advantages that distinguishes OCI from our competitors. And as Larry will discuss in more detail, beyond that, because of the momentum OCI is enjoying, customers are looking at us for many more workloads. Now, shifting to Q3 results, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rates as this is how we manage the business. So, here goes.
Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS And IaaS, was up 25% at 6.2 billion, with SaaS revenue of 3.6 in the quarter, up 10%; and IaaS revenue of 2.7 billion, up 51%, on top of 49%, which we reported last year. Now, as a reminder, the exit from our advertising business last year had the effect of lowering total cloud revenue growth by 2% this quarter. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was 11 billion, up 12%, driven again by OCI, our strategic cloud applications, and cloud database services. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were 6.2 billion, up 18%.
Record-level AI demand drove Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue, up 51% in Q3. And that's 54% when you exclude our legacy hosting, both a much higher growth rate than any of our hyperscaler competitors. Our infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of 10.6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 57%.
Demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply. Now, we do expect that the component delays that have slowed cloud capacity expansion this year should ease in Q1 FY '26. So, pretty soon. Growth in the AI segment of our infrastructure business was extraordinary.
GPU consumption revenue is now nearly three and a half times the size of last year's. Cloud database services, which were up 28%, now have annualized revenue of 2.3 billion. Autonomous database consumption revenue was up 42%, on top of the 32% growth reported last year. So, again, we have acceleration as we get bigger.
As on premise databases migrate to the cloud, either on OCI directly through public cloud, Cloud@Customer, or DRCC; or through our database-at-cloud services with Azure, Google, or AWS, we expect the cloud database revenues collectively will be the third driver of revenue growth, alongside OCI and strategic SaaS. We are currently live in 18 cloud regions with database-at-cloud services with our partners and have another 40 planned with Azure, Google, and AWS. Now, finally, database subscription revenues, which includes license support, were up 6%. Application subscription revenues, which again, include product support, were 4.8 billion and up 6% to our strategic back office.
SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of 8.6 billion and were up 18%. Software license revenues were down 8% to 1.1 billion. So, all-in, total revenues for the quarter were 14.1 billion, up 8% from last year. Now, shifting to gross profit and operating income.
The gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 10% in Q3. We continue to focus on operating expense discipline, which collectively continue to grow slower expense discipline, so expenses continue to grow slower than revenue, a trend that I expect will continue. The Q3 operating income grew 9%. And the operating margin was 44%, up slightly from last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.9%, which was higher than my 19% guidance and lowered EPS by $0.02. And EPS currency headwind ended up at $0.04 more than I thought would be hurt by currency as currency continued to strengthen. The non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in U.S. dollars, up 4% in USD, up 7% in constant currency.
The GAAP EPS was $1.02 in U.S. dollars, up 20% in USD, up 25% in constant currency. At quarter-end, we had $17.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was 9 billion, up 3%.
Operating cash flow for Q3 was 5.9 billion, slightly more than our 5.9 billion in capex as we front-loaded some purchases into the quarter. Given the demand that you see in our RPO growth and the additional demand we see in our pipeline, I expect fiscal year 2025 capex will be a little more than double what it was last year at around 16 billion. As always, we remain careful to pace and align our capex investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was up 14% at 20.7 billion, and free cash flow was 5.8 billion.
As I mentioned, remaining performance obligations, or RPO, is now 130 billion, up 63% in constant currency. And it reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger and longer contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses. Further, our cloud RPO grew over 90% and now represents more than 80% of total RPO. And approximately 31% of that total RPO number is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.
Now, we are and remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, acquisitions, repurchases, prudent use of cash -- of debt, and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 1 million shares for a total of $150 million. And over the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by more than a third at an average price of $54 a share. In addition, we have paid out dividends of 4.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% from $0.40 to $0.50 per share today.
Before I dive into Q4 specific guidance, I'd like to comment on the financial acceleration we expect to see in the coming years. We now have a clear line of sight to our future revenue growth. We remain very confident and committed to total cloud infrastructure revenue for fiscal year 2025, growing faster than the 50% reported last year. And it will be even faster for fiscal year 2026, likely a lot faster.
Our confidence in meeting our $66 billion revenue target for FY '26 is now stronger than revenue -- than ever and represents around a 15% growth rate. And more importantly, I now expect that our fiscal year '27 growth rate will be around 20%, which is even higher than I previously guided. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. And assuming exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a $0.01 to $0.02 negative effect on EPS and a 1% negative effect on revenue.
However, as usual, currency impact may be different, so focus in on constant currency. Total revenues are expected to grow from 9% to 11% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 8% to 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 24% to 28% in constant currency, is expected to grow from $25 to $27 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow from 0% to 2% and be between $1.62 and $1.66 in constant currency.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between negative one and positive one and be between $1.61 and $1.65 in USD. I should mention that my Q4 EPS guidance is negatively impacted by $0.03 plus due to losses recognized from an investment in another company. Lastly, my EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, as you saw in this quarter, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary and usually do.
And finally, I'm sure this isn't lost on anyone, but we are reporting earnings just 10 days after the close of the quarter. And that's also because there was a weekend. Using Fusion, we continue to file our quarterly and annual financial statements faster than any other company in the S&P 500. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.

Thank you, Safra. Well, as Safra pointed out, some of our existing businesses, AI training and multi-cloud database are experiencing hyper-growth. We are in the process of building a gigantic 64,000 GPU liquid-cooled NVIDIA GB200 cluster for AI training. Our multi-cloud business at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft grew 200% in the last three months alone.
But in addition to these rapidly growing existing businesses, new customers and new businesses are migrating to the Oracle Cloud at an unprecedented rate. In Q3, we signed a multi-billion dollar contract with AMD to build a cluster of 30,000 of their latest MI355X GPUs. And all four of the leading cloud security companies, CrowdStrike, Cybereason, Newfold Digital, and Palo Alto, they all decided to move to the Oracle Cloud. But, perhaps, most importantly, Oracle has developed a new product called the AI Data Platform that enables our huge installed base of database customers to use the latest AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and Meta to analyze all of the data they have stored in their millions of existing Oracle databases.
By using Oracle version 23ai's vector capabilities, customers can automatically put all of their existing data into the vector format that is understood by AI models. This allows those AI models to learn, understand, and analyze every aspect of your company or government agency, instantly unlocking the value in your data while keeping your data private and secure. This AI inferencing will be another great, large new business for Oracle. Back to you, Ken.

Great. Thanks so much for taking the question, and congrats on just remarkable booking strength. Larry, I'm hoping you can expand more on Stargate because this is just a massive scale, American-first venture with Oracle joined by undisputed AI leaders like OpenAI and NVIDIA, and they chose you over several other choices in the market. What is Oracle's unique value add here? What can Oracle do that others can't? Thanks.
Larry Ellison

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Well, I think it's -- it's actually a very simple. The capability we have is to build these huge AI clusters with technology that actually runs faster and more economically than our competitors. So, it really is a technology advantage we have over them. If you run faster and you pay by the hour, you cost less.
So, that technology advantage translates to an economic advantage which allows us to win a lot of these huge deals. And it's not just the Stargate deal, which is in our future, by the way. You know, we got to over 130 billion in RPO without any transactions from Stargate. So, again, Stargate looks to be the biggest project -- AI training project out there, and we expect that will allow us to grow our RPO even higher in the coming quarters.
And we do expect Stargate -- our first large Stargate contract fairly soon.
Brad Zelnick

Analyst
Thanks for that, Larry. If I could maybe just sneak in a very quick one for Safra. When Stargate does hit as it is a related party, is there anything that you can share with us as to how we should expect it might flow through the financials? Thanks again.
Safra Ada Catz

Chief Executive Officer
Well, it won't flow through us in any unique way. They will place contracts with us, and they'll come right through. So, I'll be explaining it to you once it's fully laid out, but it's not going to make your work harder. We're going to be very, very clear on, as the contracts come through us, it won't be as much of a change as you think.
It's just going to be even larger numbers.

Safra and Larry, congrats on a strong bookings quarter. I wanted to drill into the growth undercurrents around OCI, especially in light of such a huge RPO number that didn't even include Stargate. In some quarters, we hear about particular demand for AI contracts, certainly seems to be a lot of favorable developments going on there. But other times, we hear about emerging adoption and multi-cloud and database on hyperscalers.
And we can hear about strength and dedicated, as well with sovereign clouds and alloy. I guess as you look at Q3 bookings and pipeline trends, can you give us a sense as to how demand is unfolding across those three different environments and how you feel about the growth durability and really the infrastructure capacity, serviceability of each of these vectors?
Safra Ada Catz
--
Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean the reality is that everything is chugging on all fronts. So, multi-cloud, I gave you some of the numbers there. These numbers, I was just looking year over year because we only started really having revenue originally a year ago. It's more than 10 times what it was just a year ago.
And the numbers are exploding. As I told you, we've got 18 lives, but 40 coming online. So, that is going unbelievably well. OCI public cloud, going spectacularly.
Cloud@Customer, really going well and all the pieces around that. And we're starting -- there are whole parts that are only now rolling out which are sovereign clouds, disconnected clouds. And so, we've laid out quite a lot of capacity, and it's starting to fill up. So, bookings are going very, very well, and it's turning into revenue.
So, pretty much we're going on all cylinders for us. We're happy when customers come, you know, directly to us with their database workloads, but we're also happy when they do -- they come to us through our partners, Azure, AWS, and GCP. So, for us, we don't care. It's -- they get exactly the same capability at the -- and it's really ideal.
Derrick Wood

That's great. Thank you.
Larry Ellison

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
Yeah, I think now, they -- by the way, now, the customers can get our database everywhere. They can install an Oracle Cloud region on their premises. They can get -- you know, they can get Oracle from Azure. They can get Oracle from Google.
They can get Oracle from AWS. They obviously can get Oracle from OCI. And that Oracle database is becoming more and more capable. It does store most of the world's valuable data.
It is, by far, the largest database install base in the world with nothing remotely close. And most of those databases are still on premise, but now, they're beginning to migrate to the cloud. And one of the big drivers of them migrating to the cloud is the autonomous version of the database. And now, perhaps, just as importantly, the AI Data Platform, which allows you to take all of your existing data and make it available to any of the leading AI models.
I'll just say Grok, ChatGPT, Llama, all of them can immediately take advantage of your existing data in your existing database and turn it into insights and actions and agents directly, again, on your private data while keeping that private data private. And that has been the missing link in companies and government agencies taking full [Technical difficulty] be trained on all of the public data that's available on the internet. Now, that's a huge amount of information and makes for brilliant AI. But the AI is not -- does not have a lot of information about your company or your government agency because that that data is not available on the internet.
That is not data that the AI model was trained on. Now, with the Oracle Database 23ai, the AI model can look at your data, train itself on that data and provide you with, again, insights, actions, on your existing data while keeping it private. You don't have to share it with anybody.

Alex Zukin

Hey. Thank you, guys, and echoing the congratulations for truly unbelievable bookings number. I guess maybe, Larry, could you opine on the current kind of state of the AI training versus inferencing opportunity? You know, you have potentially investors worried about diminishing returns to training. Even some of your hyperscaler peers seemingly walking back on some of their capex commitments.
What are you seeing out there with respect to training versus inference, both in the incremental bookings that you're adding in the pipeline? And maybe just how Oracle is differentiated on the inferencing side versus both hyperscalers and neo clouds, particularly with this AI data platform product that you just announced?
Larry Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
OK, well, obviously our training business is getting bigger and bigger and bigger very rapidly as evidenced by our RPO. But it wasn't just eye training that drove the RPO up. The AI inferencing, the potential of AI inferencing, and think about all of the Oracle databases out there that that data in those databases are going to train AI models. You know, the AI models are only useful if they're familiar with the data, your data.
The AI models have to understand your products, your customers, your service requests, your financials. So, you have to make all that data available to the AI models in those databases. This has not -- you know -- this is -- we're right at the beginning of that. And again, on top of those Oracle databases now, we, ourselves, because we're in the application build business, have built lots and lots of agents on top of the Oracle on the Oracle databases and made those agents a part of our applications modernizing and automating our applications.
But customers need to do the exact same thing as they build software inside of their government agency or they build software inside -- you know, again, AI agents inside of their company. And how are they -- what is -- how do they go about doing that? Well, they go about doing that is training the AI models on their data, on their data that is currently in an Oracle database. And we make that very easy. You push a button.
You know, the Oracle -- the new version of the Oracle Database 23ai, with vector capabilities allow you to convert your data into vector format that's understood by the AI models. Nobody else has that, nobody else has that. So, you can make -- you can easily now train the AI models on your data for inferencing, obviously, and for building of agents. You can do that automatically with the Oracle database.
We are the only one with that capability. So, we think inferencing in the end is a much bigger opportunity than AI training. And there are literally millions of Oracle databases all over the world that will -- and that data, all of those millions of databases, all of that data will be used to train AI models. And on top of that, they'll build agents and applications.
We think, again, that -- I mean it's -- it's -- we don't have these one or 2 or 10 huge contracts for training because there aren't that many people building frontier models. But there are hundreds of thousands of our customers that will be consuming those AI models and training those same AI models on their private data and then running agents and applications on top of all of that. That's a much bigger market than AI training for us.

Super helpful. And maybe just, Safra, how to think about RPO trends and trending over the course of the next few quarters in light of that.
Safra Ada Catz

Chief Executive Officer
I think -- there are going to be lumpiness, as you can see, but we actually expect some extremely significant numbers coming, you know, within the next few months also. So, there's just a lot of demand, folks. There's a lot of demand where people want to lock in and schedule in to our cloud. So, we're going to see -- we're going to see increases in RPO, But, you know, remember our remaining performance obligations, we also burn down some of it, you know, through the quarter as far as capacity goes online.
But I expect that number to be extremely large. This is enormous but I expect it actually to continue to be very large amazingly.

We -- This quarter we saw a big uptick like in discussions between partners and large enterprises regarding Oracle database at pick your hyperscaler. Like the discussions seem to be in like happening in mass but not the deals yet. And one of the things a limiting factor in talking to partners was that some of these global enterprises needed it to be global because they're global enterprises. And those 40, I guess, does that get you there for that? And when -- like when do those 40 get deployed? Are they going to be deployed over the next year? Or is it going to be over the next, I don't know, about how long does that take?
Safra Ada Catz
--
Chief Executive Officer
Well, of course, we're not in full control of that. But everyone's motivated to get them as quickly as possible because as you know, the way the revenue flows through, it flows through to our partner or our host. And then, we -- and then, they pay us. So, they're very, very motivated to get it as quickly as possible because that is holding up revenue for them until they can deploy it.
So, it's been moving very quickly. They've accelerated recently. And as you can imagine, there's some significant competition between our those three hyperscalers to grab those workloads before their competitor takes them. So, it is moving quickly, but there is enormous demand.
Again, enormous demand, but that capacity is not always within our control. But they're very, very motivated to get it going because when those customers move, they often bring a lot of additional workload connected to the database, you know, into their cloud, but often directly into OCI also. And of course, we are the fourth competitor for them at the same time. So, I don't have the exact dates of someone in my organization, no doubt it does, but we do expect it in short order to be to be a lot more deployed very quickly, and demand is extremely high.

So, everyone needs a primary and a backup data center in North America. Everyone needs a primary and a backup data center in Europe. typically Western Europe, and everyone needs a primary and -- not everyone. And a lot of people need primary and backups in Asia.
So, that's six data centers. So, once we get to a primary -- you know a primary and a backup in North America and Europe and in Asia for, let's just say, Google, we're ready to roll. Most of the impediments are out of the way. But then, it's just a matter of building -- the people that want it are Japanese national companies.
That's where the multinationals. For the multinationals, that works. And then, there's obviously the Japanese domestic market and the German domestic market and so on and so forth. But I think by the time we get to 40, which is around, you know, close enough to say 12 months from now the -- as Safra said, it's not entirely in our control because AWS has to provide us with the space to -- because we're literally embedding the OCI data centers inside of AWS, inside of Google, and inside of Azure.
But we expect this is growing extraordinarily fast, and we think we'll be able to meet most of the needs of customers that need for primary and backup around the world, certainly in the coming months. And then, it's just going to be adding capacity country by country.

Thanks very much for taking the question, and I'll add my congrats on the RPO and bookings strength this quarter. Larry, you mentioned some of the agents you've been building out on top of your application platform earlier. I was just wondering, are you now starting to see the demand for those technologies or those functionality that agents are bringing, starting to have an impact on your strategic SaaS business, and, perhaps, the pace of conversions from any, you know, legacy on-prem systems that still might be out there? Thanks.

Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
OK, so, I would say -- I mean our biggest differentiator -- so, when we're -- we're competing in the healthcare field. Our biggest differentiator is the quality of our AI agents, that we have a lot of AI agents in healthcare. You know, one, we listen -- you know, when a doctor consults with a patient, we listen to that consultation, and we record all the prescriptions, all the doctor's orders, all the doctor's notes. We automatically -- we provide the doctor prior meeting with the patient, a summary of the patient, their latest lab tests and vitals.
When the doctor is finished meeting with the patient and has given all his orders, prescriptions, and come to, you know, diagnostic conclusions, we automatically update the electronic health records that are taking a huge burden off the physician. They don't have to type any of this stuff in. We just listen. The interface to our system is voice, primarily voice, which is all AI and it's -- but the whole system is made up of AI agents.
Let me give you another one, another AI agent that we're in the process of building. It is -- the doctors have to -- the hospitals have to get permission to prescribe an expensive cancer drug or to do a heart transplant or something like that or a knee transplant. They have to get prior authorization from the payer, the insurance company, and the United States or the government like the NHS in the U.K. And there's this negotiation.
You send your patients electronic health records to the insurer. The insurer looks at that, analyzes that, and says, yes, this person is authorized to use Herceptin or a cancer drug or not. But that's all done manually on the phone. But our AI agents, we read the insurance policies.
We read all the electronic health records. We actually make the determination whether this is a reimbursable drug or this is a reimbursable surgery. We do that -- we automate that entirely, make it completely electronic. This saves billions of dollars in the healthcare field and makes a huge difference and determines whether they're going to buy our system or buy some other some alternative system.
So, I know people are saying, you know, ""What's the dollar impact when you're selling the agents?"" Well, the dollar impact is we sell an entire country, an entire health system, based on whether our agents and our health software, is better than our competitors, and saves them money. So, it is -- it's not just -- you know, it's not really attributable to I agents in healthcare. It's the fact we're selling more and more healthcare systems because we have a lot of AI agents embedded in them, which helps doctor, which produces better outcomes for patients and saves governments and payers money.
Safra Ada Catz

Chief Executive Officer
And the same applies to our Fusion applications which have dozens of embedded agents, whether it's in supply chain, financials, HCM. We have literally dozens of agents already embedded in our applications. Unlike our competitors who are talking about it, we actually have them already built and deployed.
Larry Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
If I can make -- let me make one more statement. It's going to be -- since our applications are going to be primarily AI agents, again, I say it again, the applications themselves will migrate to be basically a bunch of connected AI agents. It really -- you're not going to be able to separate how much of this, you know -- how much did you make on the AI agents and how much did you make on the rest of the applications? All of our applications are becoming AI agents.
Kirk Materne

So, if I could ask a really quick follow up, is this the tipping point for any customer that hasn't moved to the cloud to have to get there now to get this functionality? Talked to some partners, it feels like anybody that's been holding out is now ready to go because they can't get any of this functionality if they're still on-prem. Thanks.
Safra Ada Catz

Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I mean this is the motivator. The ability to have your system do so much of your work. As I was signing off with my finance and audit committee and talking with my chief accounting officer, they have the entire description of the balance sheet issue. You know, all the different balance sheet parts, all done because of our products.
That is such a timesaver and so much incredible productivity and insight that you're at a disadvantage if you do not use this. And that's why I know every quarter, I mention again, we're announcing -- of course, it's Monday, I couldn't announce Sunday or Saturday or, of course, Friday something, you do only if you have bad news. So, I mean I had to announce the 10th, and imagine so much of the work that my teams do is enabled because of these advanced technologies, and it's your way to get there. ultimately everyone's going to come to it, and it should be motivating them because it is such a massive, not only productivity improvement and as a result lower costs, but it also gives you incredible insight into your business.
It's really amazing.

Thank you very much for taking my question, and really congratulations on how incredibly well this is being executed. We know Oracle spends less on capex per dollar of IaaS/PaaS revenue than your larger hyperscale cloud provider peers. But how should we understand why capex is lower? And how should we think about the trajectory of capex given the strength of RPO and especially the strength of OCI and OCI AI? Thank you.
Larry Ellison
--
Chairman and Chief Technology Officer
OK, well, I'll take a crack at that. So, we can start our data centers smaller than our competitors, and then we grow based on demand. So, building these data centers, are expensive and they're really expensive. If you don't -- if they're not full or they're not at least half full.
So, we tend to start small and then add capacity as demand arises and that allows us to have higher utilization. That's one thing. The other thing is we have a high degree of standardization and automation inside of our cloud. So, the operating in the cloud also gives us better margins.
Now, that -- you will not see that on capex, that will be on operating profit. But it's really the combination of starting smaller that affects -- and growing with demand that affects capex and then overall margins. The fact that we have a high degree of automation, which lowers our labor costs dramatically. By the way, more importantly than -- more important than lowering our labor costs with no labor, there's no human error.
There's no human mischief. So, we're much more reliable and much more secure because we don't have a lot of human beings in our data centers.

RISKS
Lip Bu Tan disclosed that 2021 was the last full fiscal year with positive adjusted free cash flow, stating, This is completely unacceptable.
Intel
(
INTC
+0.11%
)
incurred approximately $800 million in non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation for excess prior-generation tools and $200 million in one-time period costs, materially reducing gross margin to 29.7% (GAAP) and resulting in non-GAAP EPS of minus $0.10.
Lip Bu Tan confirmed the decision not to continue manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland, the consolidation of Costa Rica operations, and slower Ohio construction, directly tied to prior unwise and excessive capacity investments.
Management cited continued headwinds for non-GAAP gross margin into Q3 2025, driven by the cost structure of the Lunar Lake ramp, early Panther Lake wafer costs, and increased tariff impact, with foundry revenue expected to decline sequentially.
TAKEAWAYS
Total Revenue
-- $12.9 billion in revenue for Q2 2025, above the high end of guidance, driven by strength in client and datacenter segments.
Non-GAAP Gross Margin
-- 29.7% gross margin, including impairment and period charges; excluding these charges, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 37.5%.
EPS
-- Non-GAAP EPS of minus $0.10 due to $800 million in non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation, plus $200 million in one-time period costs; would have been $0.10 non-GAAP EPS excluding these charges.
Operating Cash Flow
-- $2.1 billion in operating cash flow was generated.
Gross CapEx
-- $4.5 billion in gross CapEx, with net CapEx was $3.1 billion and adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.1 billion.
Cash and Investments
-- $21.2 billion in cash and short-term investments at quarter end.
Intel Products Revenue
-- $11.8 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter and above expectations.
Client Computing Group (CCG) Revenue
-- Up 3% sequentially for CCG revenue, with continued PC refresh demand cited as a driver.
PCAI (Accelerated Computing) Revenue
-- Down 5% sequentially, but above expectations with offsets from Xeon 6 ramp and AI server demand.
Intel Foundry Revenue
-- $4.4 billion, down 5% quarter-over-quarter for foundry revenue, but above expectations due to Intel 7 wafer output and advanced packaging service increases.
Operating Profit (Intel Products)
-- $2.7 billion, representing 23% of segment revenue, down $250 million quarter over quarter due to period costs.
Intel Foundry Operating Loss
-- Foundry operating loss was $3.2 billion, a sequential decrease in loss of $848 million, primarily from impairment charges.
Headcount Reduction
-- Majority of actions completed to reach a target of 75,000 employees by year end, with management layers cut by approximately 50% during the quarter.
CapEx Guidance
-- 2025 gross CapEx forecast at $18 billion; net CapEx target of $8 billion to $11 billion, with expectation of a reduction in operating expenses to $16 billion in calendar year 2026.
OpEx Targets
-- OpEx planned at $17 billion for 2025 (calendar year, as stated in company guidance); Operating expense target set at $16 billion for 2026 (calendar year, non-GAAP).
Q3 2025 Guidance
-- Revenue range of $12.6 billion to $13.6 billion, with midpoint non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 36% and breakeven EPS (non-GAAP) expected.
Workforce Mandate
-- Return-to-office implementation scheduled for September.
Non-core Asset Monetizations
-- Raised approximately $900 million from a partial Mobileye stake sale; Altera transaction with Silver Lake expected to close this quarter.
Manufacturing Strategy Change
-- Cessation of Germany and Poland manufacturing projects, Costa Rica operations consolidation, and slower Ohio site construction as part of CapEx discipline tied to customer volume commitments.
Intel 18A Process Update
-- On track to support at least three product generations; Panther Lake launch confirmed for year-end; engagement with ecosystem partners and U.S. government programs ongoing.
Intel 14A Process Update
-- Early PDK released to lead customers; adoption of a foundry-oriented design approach with customer milestone-based CapEx deployment.
Key AI Initiatives
-- Focus on inference, agentic AI, and full-stack solutions; explicit plans to expand software talent base and address historical shortcomings in system software strategy.
SUMMARY
Management stated that prior capacity expansion was excessive relative to actual demand, prompting a major strategic shift toward customer-committed, milestone-driven investments and tighter CapEx discipline. Executives disclosed that foundry operations will not invest further without ""volume commitments"" and explicit customer milestones, as part of a new financial discipline to align capital expenditures with market demand. Operating margin and free cash flow remain pressured by restructuring, impairments, and high CapEx, prompting continued asset sales and cost-reduction measures, including workforce downsizing and management restructuring. The leadership team detailed initiatives for product development simplification, stricter oversight of design approvals, and disciplined architectural choices, as well as a shift to a software-led AI strategy targeting addressable segments like inference and agentic AI. Management made clear that foundry profitability at the Intel 14A node requires ""meaningful external customers"" and that CapEx funding for such expansion will only follow binding commitments.
David Zinsner said, ""beginning the process of delevering this year as cash from operations continues to improve,"" underlining liquidity management as a key priority.
Lip Bu Tan stated, ""we reduced management layers by approximately 50%,"" confirming accelerated organizational flattening and direct cost control actions.
Executives highlighted that the Lunar Lake and Panther Lake production ramps will increase costs per wafer in the short term, impacting non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 2025, but should become gross margin tailwinds as yields and volumes normalize.
Intel 18A is set as the product foundation through at least the next three client and server generations, with Panther Lake ramp expected to attract new foundry customers as published performance matures.
Management confirmed that adoption of Intel 14A as a foundry node is subject to strict performance and volume milestones, and that CapEx deployment for 14A will only occur after meeting these requirements, with external customer engagement incorporated at the definition stage.
Lip Bu Tan emphasized, ""I will only invest when I'm confident those returns exist,"" ensuring a return-on-investment approach to future CapEx decisions.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Lip Bu will open with comments on our second quarter results, as well as provide an update on our strategy and priorities. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including third quarter guidance, before we transition to answer your questions. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.
Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Lip Bu.
Lip Bu Tan:
Thank you, John. And let me add my welcome. We had a solid Q2 with revenue above the high end of our guidance. This reflects strong demand across our business and good execution by the team. As expected, headline profitability was impacted by several one-time items and impairments. But I am pleased by the underlying operating performance in the quarter, even as we have more work to do. Dave will go through our detailed financials shortly. Today, I want to provide you with updates on four major initiatives where we have started to make progress and will continue to focus in coming quarters: our organization and culture, our foundry strategy, our core x86 franchise, and our AI strategy.
First, on organization and culture. Over the last three months, I have completed a systematic review of every organization and function reporting to the CEO. This review included detailed analysis of headcount, skill sets, spending, site distribution, executive population, and restructuring plans. We have much work to do in building a clean and streamlined organization, which we have started in earnest and will remain an area of focus for me during Q3. Our goal is to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies and increase accountability at every level of the company.
As mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we need to right-size and scale back the company while ensuring that we are retaining our best internal talent and hiring the best external talents from industry and universities. During Q2, we completed the majority of the actions needed to achieve our year-end target of seventy-five thousand employees. These were hard but necessary decisions, and we reduced management layers by approximately fifty percent in the process. We are on track to implement our return-to-office mandate starting September. These actions are necessary not just to reduce our operating expenses, but to make the company more agile, collaborative, and vibrant, to simplify our business and improve our product and process execution.
Next, on our foundry strategy. I continue to believe that our heritage and expertise in semiconductor technology development and manufacturing remain a very valuable and vital asset. I also fully appreciate the strategic importance of the US domicile semiconductor manufacturing. Transforming this unique asset into a robust foundry business requires us to take a systematic approach and act from a position of strength. The foundry business is a service business that relies on the foundational principle of trust. We need to demonstrate to our customers that we can deliver wafers on time with high-quality reliability, and that we can manufacture products at scale.
We need to have process and packaging technology that is not only competitive but, more importantly, is designed to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we also need to develop a rich and diverse ecosystem of IP and EDA partners who will enable our customers to seamlessly design chips using our process. And finally, perhaps most importantly, we need to build capacity smartly and carefully, on a schedule that meets the needs of our customers and supports the economics of our business. This approach is fundamentally different than the path we have been on for the last four years.
Unfortunately, the capacity investments we made over the last several years were well ahead of demand and were unwise and excessive. Our factory footprint has become needlessly fragmented. Going forward, we will grow our capacity based solely on the volume commitments and deploy CapEx in lockstep with tangible milestones and not before. As part of this new financial discipline, we have decided not to continue with our manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland. We also plan to consolidate our assembly and test operations in Costa Rica into larger existing sites in Vietnam and Malaysia. And we will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio to ensure our spending is aligned with market demand.
Importantly, based on the progress we have already made in Ohio, we have the flexibility to accelerate work as needed to meet customer needs. Turning specifically to process technology development, on Intel 18A, we will continue to make steady progress on our year-end performance targets. Intel 18A is the foundation of at least the next three generations of Intel client and server products, and we remain committed to ramping this technology to scale. Intel 18A and Intel 18AP are critical nodes for Intel products and will drive meaningful wafer volumes well into the next decade. Our foundry and products teams remain focused on enabling Panther Lake to launch this year.
Once we get our own product ramping in high volume, we will be in a better position to attract external customers to this technology. The Intel 18A family is also important as we continue to advance our work for the US government within the secure engrave programs, as well as for other initial committed customers. On Intel 14A, the foundry technology team is continuing to focus on the basic building blocks: technology definitions, transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, PDKs, foundation IPs, and test chips to validate and improve performance and defect density.
Designing 14A from its inception as a foundry node from the ground up better positions us to meet specific customer requirements and address a broader segment of the market. This work is being driven and informed by direct input from large external customers and from our own internal products teams. A key aspect of prudently pursuing our foundry ambition is also making sure we maintain sensible optionality for our internal product teams. We will continue to work closely with both internal and external foundry partners. They will do their homework and make process and supplier decisions based on what is best for our end customers against criteria of performance, cost, yield, and time to market.
Our external foundry strategy has always been rooted in the economic reality of semiconductor manufacturing. Up to and through Intel 18A, we could generate a reasonable return on our investments with only Intel products. The increase in capital cost at Intel 14A makes it clear that we need both Intel products and meaningful external customers to drive acceptable returns on our deployed capital. And I will only invest when I'm confident those returns exist. I'm intimately familiar with the foundry and fabulous ecosystem, having helped create it over the last two decades. I'm using that experience to put our Intel foundry on a more solid footing for the future.
I will do so while being prudent with our capital and ensure we can deliver attractive returns on the investment we make. I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come. Under my leadership, we will build what customers need when they need it and earn their trust through consistent execution. Next, onto our core x86 franchise. In client, our top priority is delivering our first Panther Lake SKU by year-end, followed by additional SKUs in the first half of 2026. The successful launch of the Panther Lake will solidify our strong share in the notebook market across consumer and enterprise.
We still have gaps to close in the high-end desktop market, but I'm encouraged by our unmatched go-to-market reach, our x86 ecosystem, and the progress we are making on Nova Lake due out at the end of 2026. In traditional servers, we continue to have a solid position in AI host nodes and storage, where our single-threaded performance has been optimized for those workloads. Granite Rapids is ramping as planned, and we continue to see good demand for our more established server products. But sustainable share improvement in this market will take time. Specifically, we need to improve in broader hyperscale workloads, where performance per watt is a key differentiator.
I have also taken steps to correct past mistakes regarding multithreading capabilities on our P-cores. I'm also making progress on bringing in new leadership in our data center business and look forward to being able to announce these changes next quarter. Longer term, my directive to our silicon and platform teams is to define products with clean and simple architecture, better cost structure, to simplify our SKU stack, all while enabling a path to robust product margin. I'm also instituting a policy where every major chip design needs to be personally reviewed and approved by me before tape-out. I have already begun this process.
This discipline will improve our execution speed and move us towards a first-time-right mindset while also saving development costs. Finally, turning to AI. In the past, we approached AI with a traditional silicon and training-centric mindset, without a cohesive silicon system software stack and strategy. But we do need to build and consolidate upon our silicon franchise, based upon our x86 CPU and our Xe GPUs. We recognize the need to move up this abstraction stack into system and software. This is the area where Intel has traditionally been weak or entirely absent, but we intend to incubate and grow this important skill set and capabilities under my leadership.
This will take time, but it will be vital for Intel to stay relevant in the next wave of computing. In addition, we see the AI market continuing to evolve, and we are concentrating our effort on areas we believe we can disrupt and differentiate, like inference and agentic AI. We need to start by first understanding emerging and real AI workloads, then work backwards to design software systems and silicon to enable the best outcome for those particular workloads. We will strive to become the compute platform of choice, but we will also work towards a full-stack AI solution, and I look forward to sharing more on our strategy in the coming months.
Underpinning all of these efforts is a strong focus on improving our balance sheet. We continue to maintain solid liquidity, and despite meaningful capital spending offsets, our last full fiscal year of positive adjusted free cash flow was 2021. This is completely unacceptable. How we allocate our owner's capital and the return we generate for them is of paramount importance to me. We have several major levers to generate better cash flow, including driving operating leverage and managing our capital outlays. I discussed earlier the actions we have taken to reduce operating expenses and improve execution. I'm very confident in our ability to hit our operating expenses targets for 2025 and 2026, respectively.
We have already lowered our CapEx guidance from the beginning of the year by roughly $5 billion year-to-date. While purchasing commitments make further reduction in 2025 difficult, we will continue to work to reduce capital spending in 2026. Lastly, as it relates to our non-core assets, we successfully monetized a portion of our ownership of Mobileye earlier this month, and we look forward to closing the Altera transaction with Silver Lake this quarter. I will evaluate other opportunities as we continue to sharpen our focus around our core business and strategy. I believe the actions we have taken during my first few months are steering us in the right direction.
Let's say, I also know that turning the company around will take time and require patience. We have a lot to fix in order to move the company forward, and I'm determined to drive the changes necessary to improve our performance. I'm equally confident that as we execute, we will rebuild this company and have a bright future. I will now turn it over to Dave to go into more detail on the financials.
David Zinsner:
Thank you, Lip Bu. I'll start by care. On our Q1 earnings call, we signaled the economic landscape had become increasingly uncertain, driven by shifting trade policies, persistent inflation concerns, and increased regulatory risk. Fortunately, markets largely functioned normally in Q2, enabling the fundamental demand drivers underpinning our core markets to manifest. In client, we saw continued solid demand driven by end-of-service for Windows 10 and the aging COVID-era installed base. In addition, AI PCs continued to grow as a percentage of our mix. On the traditional server side, we saw hyperscalers and enterprises continue to refresh their CPU installed base to take advantage of our newer products with better performance within a lower power envelope.
Both dynamics underscore the durable demand within our two largest markets and the enduring strength of the x86 ecosystem. Second quarter revenue was $12.9 billion, coming in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by strength across client and datacenter. Similar to comments we made in Q4 and Q1, we think it's likely Q2 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior to mitigate tariff uncertainty, although it continues to be difficult to quantify. Turning to non-GAAP gross margins and EPS, last quarter, we indicated that incremental costs associated with our spending reduction plan would likely impact non-GAAP gross margin.
But since those costs were not yet calculated, they were not included in our Q2 gross margin and EPS guidance of 36.5% and breakeven, respectively. As such, we recognized approximately $800 million of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges related to excess prior generation tools for which we couldn't find reuse and approximately $200 million of one-time period costs. These charges resulted in Q2 gross margin of 29.7% and EPS of minus ten cents. Excluding these charges, our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin would have been 37.5% and non-GAAP EPS would have been ten cents, both results ahead of our Q2 guidance.
Beyond those costs, we also were impacted by $1.9 billion of charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. The large majority of those charges are associated with the severance for our headcount reduction aligned with our restructuring plan. We expect the principal cash cost associated with these decisions to have us firmly on track to meet our calendar year 2025 and calendar year 2026 OpEx targets of $17 billion and $16 billion, respectively. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.1 billion, with gross CapEx of $4.5 billion in the quarter and net CapEx of $3.1 billion, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.1 billion.
We have $21.2 billion of cash and short-term investments and remain focused on beginning the process of delevering this year as cash from operations continues to improve. Moving to segment results for Q2, Intel products revenue was $11.8 billion, up slightly sequentially and above our expectations across client and server. I was pleased by the team's ability to support revenue upside in the quarter as capacity for Intel 7 remains very tight. CCG revenue was up 3% quarter over quarter and above our expectation with continued PC refresh demand and upside in hedge deployments.
Within the quarter, CCG launched a number of AI PCs with key OEM partners, announced the expansion of its Arc GPUs for AI use cases tailored to inference and professional workstations, and made its open edge platform code available to the developer community, all in support of the growing opportunity for us to compete as AI inference moves to the edge. PCAI revenue was down 5% sequentially but above expectations, driven by variability in hyperscale demand, partially offset by continued strength in host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute. In addition, we saw upside to plan on the continued ramp of Xeon 6, code-named Granite Rapids.
In Q2, DC AI launched three new Xeon 6 processors with priority core turbo technology to boost AI workloads. One of these Xeon 6 SKUs was selected as the host node for NVIDIA DGX D300 AI-accelerated systems, and the Imperial College London chose Xeon 6 to power its latest HPC supercomputer, demonstrating Xeon remains the CPU of choice for AI workloads. Operating profit per Intel products was $2.7 billion, 23% of revenue, and down $250 million quarter over quarter, principally driven by the period costs I highlighted earlier. Intel foundry delivered revenue of $4.4 billion, down 5% sequentially and above expectations on better-than-forecasted output of Intel 7 wafers and increased advanced packaging services.
In Q2, 18A reached a key milestone with the start of production wafers in Arizona ahead of Intel products' Q4 launch of its next-generation client product, code-named Panther Lake. Intel foundry released an early version of Intel 14A's PDK to lead external customers and, at Direct Connect in April, announced an EMIB advanced packaging partnership with Amcor. Intel foundry operating loss in Q2 was $3.2 billion, down $848 million sequentially, materially driven by the $800 million impairment charges I discussed earlier. Turning to all other, revenue came in at $1.1 billion and was up 12% sequentially and above expectations. The three primary components of all other are Mobileye, Altera, and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $69 million of operating profit.
Now turning to guidance. Historically, sequential growth in Q3 has been up high single digits. However, we've seen three quarters of revenue growth above our expectations, which we attribute at least in part to customers hedging against tariff uncertainty. As such, while we believe that the underlying fundamentals of our core markets support growth, we feel it prudent to continue to plan for a below-seasonal second half of 2025. As such, for Q3, we're forecasting a revenue range of $12.6 to $13.6 billion, down 2% to up 6% sequentially. Within Intel products, we expect more strength in CCG.
We expect Intel foundry revenue down slightly quarter over quarter due to capacity constraints in Intel 7, which we expect to persist through the second half of the year, and reduced expectations for external advanced packaging revenue. For all other, we expect revenue for the sum of those parts to be roughly flat sequentially. At the midpoint of $13.1 billion, we expect a gross margin of approximately 36% on an increased mix of outsourced products, yearly ramp of Panther Lake, and increased costs associated with tariffs. We forecast a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis. We're forecasting 2025 OpEx of $17 billion, with a 2026 OpEx target of $16 billion.
We expect non-controlled income, or NCI, to be approximately $250 million to $300 million in both Q3 and Q4 on a GAAP basis. NCI is still expected to grow meaningfully in fiscal year 2026. In Q2, we took tangible steps to increase focus on our core business while leveraging non-core assets to shore up the balance sheet. We raised approximately $900 million through the Mobileye offering, and we are on track to complete the stake sale of Altera in Q3. Our guidance includes Altera for the full quarter, but we will deconsolidate at deal close. Once the deconsolidation is complete, we will recognize our remaining Altera investment within equity investments on the balance sheet.
On the income statement, we will recognize our proportional share of Altera's net income on a one-quarter lag through gains and losses on equity investments net, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. As a result, it is likely our Q3 non-GAAP results will reflect only a portion of the financial results for Altera. Moving to CapEx, we anticipate 2025 gross capital investment will be approximately $18 billion and forecast $8 billion to $11 billion for net CapEx. Better utilization of our construction in progress will allow us to deploy more overall CapEx in 2025 than in 2024, and we expect the improved utilization to continue in 2026, resulting in lower gross and net CapEx next year.
Beginning the process of delevering our balance sheet in 2025 remains a top priority for us. I'll wrap up by saying Q2 operationally was the third consecutive solid quarter, reflecting our commitment to maintain a high SEI do ratio, closely manage within our control, and react quickly as the environment evolves. I have confidence that the strategic priorities we've established are the right ones, and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on them while acknowledging there are no quick fixes. With that, I'll turn it over to John to start the Q&A.
John Pitzer:
Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore:
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Let me do the first one for you, and thank you for walking through the strategic details that you're putting into place. It seems like fixing the foundry side is based on trust, as you said before, and that trust seems to have its origin in fixing the x86 side of the business. So I guess my question is, how fast can you fix that? I know you are having to sign off on every tape-out, but is the trust that 18A can ramp dependent upon Nova Lake and Diamond Rapids, or are we talking 2027, 2028?
What are the sort of steps we need to see to build that trust in your x86 business so that the foundry business can ramp?
Lip Bu Tan:
Ross, thank you so much for a good question. First of all, we focus on the 18A. We, you know, so far, the last two months, and I have twice a week review with the team. And, you know, we make steady progress on our technology towards the yield performance target and reliability. So I think, as you mentioned, 18A is a foundation for at least three generations of Intel client and server business products, and we are committed to ramp that. And so far, you know, the confidence is we're engaging with external ecosystem partners to help us look at the year and how can we improve. And that in the past, we didn't engage that.
So I really see that, you know, the feedback from the partners that say, hey, culture, the intensity for our team is really focused on the yield performance, and they really like the attitude on that. So far, I think it gives me a lot of confidence that we can launch our Panther Lake SKU by the end of the year. And then also, I think the external customer includes secure and create with the US government. And then with sufficient internal volume, then show the good progress we can have a better attraction to our external customer. So I think this is a process to kind of build the trust with the customer.
They can count on us on the reliability, the yield, and we can deliver on time, on scale, to really supporting them. And then they're gonna just put the resources in on their revenue based on our foundry. So there's a lot of response, and that's something that I feel very committed, and we like what we see. It gives me a lot more confidence.
John Pitzer:
Ross, do you have a follow-up question, please?
Ross Seymore:
Yeah, I do. One potentially a little nearer term for Dave on the gross margin side. You mentioned that the gross margin was guided down a bit sequentially for a couple different reasons. Can you dive a little more deeply into those and perhaps more importantly, just what do you see as the tailwinds and headwinds to gross margin as we look, say, into next year? I know you're not going to guide it specifically, but just some of the puts and takes would be great. Thank you.
David Zinsner:
Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Ross. Yeah. Let's just delve into the gross margins for the third quarter. I'd say the predominant driver of lower gross margins in the third quarter is Lunar Lake. We expect a pretty significant ramp in Lunar Lake in the third quarter. And, you know, I've made this comment, I think, multiple times on calls, but it's got the memory in the package, and so, you know, we kind of pass it on at the same cost we bought it, and that really has a negative impact on the way the gross margins look, you know, optically.
And so as we mix higher to Lunar Lake, that's obviously gonna be a headwind to us in terms of gross margins. As expected, but perhaps having a little bit more of a significant transition from Q2 to Q3. We thought we'd have probably more volume in Q2. The second big driver of gross margins is the ramp that we just talked about of Panther Lake. Obviously, we're in the early stages of the maturity of Panther Lake, so the cost per wafer is gonna be higher, and so that is gonna drive some headwinds. Obviously, as Lip Bu said, you know, yields improve. More importantly, volumes increase.
That reduces the cost, and so that will transition to a tailwind ultimately. I think next year, you know, the big benefit for us is this significant ramp in Panther Lake. You know, given that we're bringing a fair amount of wafers back inside, that drives a lower cost, and we get those better cost structures of Panther Lake showing up with the higher volumes. That's clearly gonna be beneficial to us in terms of gross margin. You know, that said, you know, a lot of this will be determined on mix, and we'll have to see how things play out through next year in terms of the mix.
The last thing I'd say, and maybe this is maybe even a little bit more long-term than you asked the question, Ross, you know, the way we think about foundry, we, you know, as we ramp more leading-edge nodes, that is going to be a benefit to us in terms of gross margins. We think foundry gross margins will expand next year, and that will be a continuing story out for several years. The other side of things is the product side, and I think there are three levers to products. One is pricing. And as Lip Bu said, he's really focused on bringing out products that customers really value.
And as that becomes a reality, it'll show up in the pricing that will help us on gross margin. The second is the cost structure, and Lip Bu is also really focusing on cleaner designs, simpler designs, driving more efficient use of silicon and so forth. And so, you know, as we get better cost structure as well over time, and there are products on the roadmap that already have it even as POR, we'll see improvement in gross margins.
And then in the near term, while all this is going on, I'm looking at all the other extraneous things that drive cost of sales, you know, how many samples we do, you know, how we run the fabs, and so forth, and driving improvements there to position us for better gross margins.
John Pitzer:
Ross, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri:
Thanks a lot. Let me I wanted to ask about the foundry strategy. You did add a bunch of risk factors and language on 14A that kinda seems to leave the door open to kinda walking away from its development. And I know you did talk about some of that, but if I'm an outside customer and I'm looking at your roadmap and I see this, you know, hedging on 14A, why would I engage? I guess, how do you sort of marry the hedging on 14A development with trying to build an external foundry business?
I guess, I kinda read it as maybe a hard pivot away from foundry and doing what's right for the product business, can you sort of talk about that?
Lip Bu Tan:
Yeah. Very good question. So I think on the 14A, you know, first of all, I think the team is laser-focused on building up the basic building blocks: technology definition, transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, PDK, and foundation IP, and the test chip to verify and improve the performance and the defect density. Saying that, you know, clearly, we learn quite a lot on the mistake we made on the 18A. And now we apply it to the 14A. So I think we learn a lot.
And secondly, we also reach out to the outside, you know, the partners to help us with shortening the data and how can we improve the yield and performance so that we can drive that. It gives me a lot of confidence we can get there. But even more important, we are engaging with customers who are gonna enable us and then with clear milestones to execute in terms of process development and with PDK, with all the different IP that we need to really put it together. I think that gives me a lot more comfort in that. This time, we have customers engaging early enough in the inception.
And also, we learn from our mistakes, and we can learn quicker and then get a better result. So I think all in all, I think it gives a lot more confidence that the team is laser-focused. And the feedback from the partners and outside is that, wow. Look. The culture is changing. And you guys are really focused on the yield and product than just the performance. So I think that part, I think, will be able to enable us. Plus, the other part is we really engage with all the external EDA and IP providers. Make sure that we have the whole, you know, program together to do the pattern matching for the customer.
And the good news is customers are excited. The 14A is a process node. But, clearly, I will make sure that, you know, until I see the internal customer, external customer volume commitment, before I put CapEx into the, you know, operation. So that is something that I had to meet my requirement in terms of performance and yield. You know, it's a lot of responsibility to be serving our customers. Make sure that we can deliver the result, consistent, reliable result to them so that their revenue can depend on us.
Timothy Arcuri:
Tim, do you have a quick follow-up question?
Timothy Arcuri:
I do. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I just kinda wonder, like, how an external, you know, customer would, you know, continue to be engaged. But the, you know, question really is for Dave. So, Dave, you talked about CapEx coming down next year. What is maintenance CapEx like? How much can you cut CapEx next year? Could you take, like, $5 billion out of gross CapEx next year if you can give some sense on that? Thanks.
David Zinsner:
Yeah. Okay. Good question. Let me unpack it a little bit. I would say why CapEx can come down next year is, you know, we bought a lot over the last few years, quite honestly, and, you know, we have to digest that, and that enables us to deploy more capital than we have to spend, which I guess is a good thing at this point. So that's what's driving the fundamental view that we should be down in CapEx. It's not really moving it to maintenance CapEx, I would say.
But, you know, to kind of ballpark a number, I'd say probably half our CapEx is maintenance, you know, but our normalized CapEx call at this $18 billion level for this year probably you consider sustaining or maintenance CapEx?
John Pitzer:
Thank you, Jonathan. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joseph Moore:
Great. Thank you. You mentioned again the Intel 7 being in short supply through the end of the calendar year. Can you talk about, you know, what's driving that? Are you gonna be able to drive more volume to the Intel 4 products? And, you know, what you have to add wafer starts in Intel. So I'm just kinda curious what's going on with that.
David Zinsner:
Yeah. I mean, you know, Raptor Lake is doing really well. I mean, that's the biggest driver of it. That's why back to my comments around Lunar Lake ramping next quarter. You know, what we're really seeing a lot of strength in is Raptor Lake right now. I think, you know, the price points of Raptor Lake are, I think, where a lot of consumers and enterprises are buying PCs, and so that's what's kind of pulling it in. But I do suspect that we'll see mixes change. You mentioned Intel 4, you know, Meteor Lake, and of course, we all are ramping and are in the process of ramping Granite Rapids, which will drive more volume of Intel 4.
So we're already, you know, building out capacity and wafer outs in that area.
Joseph Moore:
Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
Joseph Moore:
Yeah. I do. Coming back to the CapEx, I mean, you still have a large amount of construction in progress that hasn't yet been productively employed. Are you gonna be able to get full value out of that? I know there was a shelter strategy. Is it gonna continue to persist if there's a large amount of that or, you know, will you start depreciating that at some point?
David Zinsner:
Yeah. There was a big chunk of it that was Arizona, actually, and we actually flipped that at the beginning of this quarter. So that's all, you know, obviously already ramping on 18A. So we actually saw it come in, I think it was north of fifty at the end of Q2, fifty billion. And I think we're at this point now down into the kind of mid to high thirties. So we've made a significant move in the right direction. You know, construction products or assets under construction is a mix of equipment and buildings. And so the other thing that we're doing is trying to use more of that. So that will also bring the number down.
So we should have a steady improvement in that number through the rest of this year, and the goal is to kind of drive it down further next year. That said, we are going, you know, we are going to want to continue to have optionality on fab white space. And that's, you know, while we are slowing down Ohio, we're not stopping Ohio. So we're gonna continue to make investments there will be assets under construction or construction in progress on our balance sheet to make sure we have flexibility as the demand drivers change.
John Pitzer:
Thanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes from UBS.
Benjamin Reitzes:
Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Wanted to ask about servers. I may have missed it, but what's the trend you're expecting into the third quarter? And what are your thoughts about share losses there and when perhaps those dissipate a bit, you know, into the following year.
David Zinsner:
Let me see. Oh, okay. So I'll take we have we're not giving out the guidance by business unit. You know, we're roughly up a little bit. We'll have to see how things play out between servers and CPUs. You know, as far as share goes, you know, obviously, you know, we're not where we wanna be in terms of a competitive portfolio, and that's what Lip Bu is really focused on improving. That said, you know, Granite Rapids is a better part. Diamond Rapids, the next part, will be a better part. So we think we continually improve our relative competitive position, but to really be where we wanna be still take some work.
And so, you know, I think the great thing about it is we actually have held share relatively well despite, you know, our position in the market in terms of performance. And I think it's a good testament to, you know, the x86 ecosystem and the strength of that and our particular capabilities in the x86 system in terms of, you know, the ecosystem that we provide and to our customers.
Benjamin Reitzes:
Doug, do you have a follow-up?
Benjamin Reitzes:
Yeah. I was wondering if Lip Bu would mind expanding on his comment. Obviously, you're gonna be updating that at some point. You don't mind clarifying when that will be, but what do you are you inferring that you know, that you have a GPU-centric strategy or something else, and how should we be thinking about how you're gonna attack that market? Thanks.
Lip Bu Tan:
Yeah. Very good question. So I think we're gonna unfold our AI strategy in the months to come. But let me just share with you I think we're gonna look at it from where are we gonna target and focus. And, you know, first of all, is the inference side. And also the agentic AI, and that is really taking off. And we want to provide that interception on that. And then we're gonna take a different approach. We're gonna look at the whole system software, the silicon, and then drive the, you know, the performance. And then the agentic AI is very important. It's the accuracy and speed.
So I think with all this AI, compute gonna be even more intensive. But the workload is a little bit different. So we want to look at how can we intercept using our franchise of x86 and then with the accelerator and then somehow drive that whole become the compute platform of the future. And so those are the things that we're in the drawing board while working on it. Then we will share with you when we are ready. And we so far, the engagement with customers, they love what we are. Basically, we have to put the team and we're delighted.
We add on a few team members come on board, also, we're gonna focus on adding more software talents in a way that we can really drive some of this opportunity, and be a player in this opportunity.
John Pitzer:
Ben, thanks for the question. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from True Security. Your question, please.
William Stein:
Great. Thank you for taking my question. Lip Bu, I'd also like to lean into this AI topic a little bit because I think you might not have used the words full stack, but that's certainly what it sounds like. And so I think about the opportunity that Intel has I guess I've thought of it as you wanna be sort of like Nvidia, but Nvidia already has a very established position. You have cloud service providers doing ASICs, and you have AMD trying to do the same thing.
So it sounds almost like you're aiming to be the third or arguably the fourth supplier in a market where, you know, there's really only two successful and so far Nvidia and some of its customers. And I wonder to what degree you have considered or are still considering another approach like doing ASICs to establish a better position in this market? I hope that question makes sense, but any clarification and education you could provide us would help a lot. Thank you.
Lip Bu Tan:
Yeah. Very good question. Thank you. And then first of all, I think you are correct. You know, what I described about the system software is a full-stack solution we try to provide. And then, clearly, we are behind and we had tried to find the area that we can really wedge in then try a different solution and service. And I think, meanwhile, I want to play into our strength in the x86 so that we can really play in that whole orchestrating what is the workload and then how do we optimize that. And then the other part is also important.
Look at some of the new architecture and that's why I am embracing some of the startups and some of the incubating ideas so that we can bring that in. Back to your another question that you have. Is the ASIC. So we are also very open working with the system company providing the AI platform that it can be a purpose-built and then so that really drive their performance. So, absolutely, we're gonna drive that opportunity.
William Stein:
Will, do you have a follow-up question?
William Stein:
Yeah. I'd like to maybe just ask about the write-downs in the quarter. It sounds like that was a quick how on what you're writing down to the degree you think it would help us. Thank you.
David Zinsner:
Okay. Yeah. We did have inventory write-downs, but we weren't isolating that. That's just part of the normal cost of sales roll-up. The write-down that we're isolating mostly was around roughly around impairments of equipment. And then there was another couple hundred million dollars that was a kind of an adjustment in terms of how we take some certain extraneous costs, originally through inventory and now moving it more to a period cost. The equipment, it was kind of a bunch of different things, but I would say I'll give you one of the bigger ones that was an example. We had some tools that we had bought. They were sitting in assets under construction.
Relatively had tools in the line. That were older tools, and we took the opportunity since we had, you know, an extra excess amount is we took the newer tools, put them in line, took the older tools out. They had a higher net book value than the value we can get in the open marketplace if we sell them. We wrote them down to that value and, you know, they'll be held and assets held for sale. So it was things of that nature. Like I said, mostly older tools that we just couldn't find a purpose for.
John Pitzer:
Thanks. Well, Jonathan, can we have the next question?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon:
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, I wanted to touch on 18A and 14A. So you said 18A would be supplying the next three generations of Intel products. So I guess that's 2026, 2027, and 2028. I guess that would suggest 14A if it comes out. Would be 2029 at the earliest. I guess, number one, is that timing correct? And then, you know, just within that, given the plans, you know, at least the contingency plans that maybe knocked you for 14A, I mean, I guess it's suggested if 14A dies, does the foundry strategy die with it?
And can you run a sustainable business just on internal volume with 18A and increasing outsource if 14A doesn't do what it needs to do?
Lip Bu Tan:
Stacy, it's a good question. So first of all, I think the as I mentioned earlier, 18A is important to us for the three generations of internal product. And then when we're ready, then we can go outside with more confidence to get a customer to support us. And then on the 14A, you know, the same as a 14 from TSMC, the timing is all in the 2028, 2029. So then there's no different, no change. And clearly, while laser-focused on the process technology with the two engaging customers. And with clear milestones to deliver.
And then, clearly, I think we're gonna learn a lot then we're not gonna put any CapEx until we see the yield performance and also our internal customer and next external customer feedback and the volume commitment then we'll put the CapEx in. And so the perception will be very clear. We are committed to the foundry business. And then meanwhile, we're gonna be very disciplined in our CapEx deployment, make sure that we see the volume, see the customer commitment, then we deploy.
David Zinsner:
Maybe I'll just add one more thing. If I understood the last question, can you still do 18A? I think it's what you said. You know, we actually won't get to peak volumes on 18A until probably the beginning of the next decade. So this is gonna be a node that we use for a very long time, and we're expecting a really good ROI on it. We largely are calculating that based on the internal uses for it, given that most of that is coming internally in the near term. I would say I wouldn't write off 18A as potentially getting external customers at that point.
We clearly, we probably won't get a lot in wave one as it seems, but there will be multiple waves and 18A will find different use cases over time, and there'll be more opportunities for us to attract external customers after we do so much improvement in terms of performance and yield on our own products.
John Pitzer:
Stacy, do you have a quick follow-up?
Stacy Rasgon:
I do. Thanks. I wanna ask about the CapEx. So you talked about sustaining CapEx at, like, fifty percent of the current level, which could be, like, nine billion, I guess. Should I be thinking about that as a plausible scenario for next year? I mean, if I take the current, like, run rate for this year, like, the gross CapEx in the first half and eighteen billion for the year, it suggests, like, a quarterly run rate of, I don't know, three point six billion would be something like fourteen, fourteen and a half billion. For the year.
Like or like, I'm trying to figure out, like, what's a plausible number for where you might land next year given what you see. Is nine billion actually on the table or is it closer to fourteen or like, what do you guys actually have in mind?
David Zinsner:
Yeah. Fair question, Stacy. I was given, like, a ballpark, you know, what would be just, you know, we weren't, like, moving forward with something. But clearly, we're gonna need our assets under construction will not be enough to support all our CapEx investments even with maintenance CapEx next year. So you know, we haven't quite figured out exactly yet what the plan will look like for next year. We don't lock in our CapEx until early in the year, so that would be, you know, sometime in the January time frame of 2026 that will lock in 2026's CapEx. But I think it's meaningfully higher than nine billion. But certainly, we think it's gonna be less than eighteen.
John Pitzer:
Thanks, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America's Gear. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya:
Thanks. For my first question, I wanted to discuss competition in the server CPU market. I see in your 10-Q, you mentioned that server ASPs are down eight percent from last year because of a competitive environment. I thought that, you know, rising cores would mean greater ASPs, which is if you could address that. But then kinda more medium to longer term, let's go how impactful is competition from ARM who is claiming to take over half the server market?
Lip Bu Tan:
Yeah. Good question. So I think, tell me the look at the server market. You know, clearly, you know, we still have about, you know, fifty-five percent market share. And, clearly, we have some mistakes we make on the high-end performing server area. And, you know, one thing is this, called synchronized multithreading. And I think used to be Intel's strength. But somehow we overlook it. And then now we are double down make sure that we will have that performance gap we can narrow. And then meanwhile, we're also engaging with some of the big hyperscale also high-end enterprise.
We learn for the other workload they require, and we raise the focus on getting the product to roadmap clear and simplify and make it easier to work with us. And so I think we take all the steps. We listen to customers. One thing that I think we changed is listening to customers very closely. And then engaging with them early in the product development and definition stage and they love it. And so I think we have a chance to regain back and then with the new products so that we can really drive the success here.
Vivek Arya:
Zack, do you have a quick follow-up?
Vivek Arya:
Yes. Thank you. Maybe one for Dave on gross margins. So, Dave, let's say your sales grow mid-single digit next year, hypothetically, what will gross margins do when you look at all the puts and takes around the mix of 18A and what you need to outsource? I know you're not giving specific outlook, but let's say your top line growth, is there a simple formula to look at the gross margin versus the thirty-six percent level that you're at right now?
David Zinsner:
Thank you. Obviously, the devil's in the details on this, but I think a good rule of thumb is we get, you know, somewhere in the forty to sixty percent fall through. Next year, you know, hopefully closer to the higher end of that if things work out in our favor.
John Pitzer:
Thank you. Jonathan, we have time for one last question, please.
Operator:
Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers:
Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanna go back to the server discussion as well. I know in the past, you guys have talked about the progression of 18A and Clearwater Forest, which I can appreciate the lower volume SKU. But I'm curious as you think about stabilizing your market share and maybe being able to recapture share, do you think that's a function of Diamond Rapids? And if so, can we at all think about the timing of Diamond Rapids as, you know, 2026, second half of 2026? Any clarity on that would be helpful.
Lip Bu Tan:
Yeah. I think the good question I think clearly, we are looking at reviewing our roadmap. And then, you mentioned about Clearwater Forest. Then the Diamond Rapids. And, clearly, I think the time frame and, you know, it's a plus and minus. You know, six months. And I think overall, I think we are pretty much focused on that. And the next generation, though, the Coral Rapids. And clearly, we're gonna be reviewing the whole Corals market and will be on the 2028, 2029. We make sure that we have robust products to come out. So I think it's gonna be fine-tuned and re-note discuss with the customer get the validation from the customer.
And then, so far, I think we are and now we can also have a new leader and need some changes I'm making. And then, clearly, I think we're gonna drive that whole data center is a very important business for us. Become competitive again.
Aaron Rakers:
Do you have a quick follow-up?
Aaron Rakers:
Yeah. I do. Thanks, John. So real quickly, just, Dave, I wanna go back, like, to skip or the Arizona and the Ireland fabs. Just remind us again how we should be modeling that. I think in the past, you talked about a five hundred million headwind this year and then that going to, like, one point three to one point five billion next year. And significantly higher in the in 2027. So any kind of updates? Should we still think about that? Is that increasing just, you know, any color?
David Zinsner:
Yeah. Those are roughly the right numbers to forecast. You know, obviously, once we get out into the 2027, 2028 time frame, we're kinda hitting the normalized run rates of these skips. So it'll be higher than the one two to one three. We'll update you as we progress.
Lip Bu Tan:
Thank you all for joining us today. I must say I have been pleased with the teams and the progress we have made transitioning a financially disciplined foundry, resetting how we engage with our customer and our partners, and simplifying our operations. I look forward to discussing our continued progress with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

SUMMARY
Intel
(
INTC
+0.13%
)
reported revenue and profitability that exceeded prior guidance for Q3 2025 on a non-GAAP basis, accompanied by four consecutive quarters of improved execution. Strategic liquidity actions included significant cash inflows from US government and private partnerships, which bolstered Intel’s operational flexibility and reduced balance sheet risk. Segment results highlighted strong sequential growth in both client and data center revenue for Q3 2025, with ongoing supply constraints limiting fulfillment in key nodes and Foundry. Management guided for Q4 revenue and margins to be pressured by product mix and new product ramp costs, with guidance provided on a non-GAAP basis, while underscoring disciplined capital deployment and a multi-year roadmap anchored in AI, foundry, and custom silicon opportunities. Intel’s partnership announcements with NVIDIA and the US government reflect a clear strategy to leverage x86 leadership amid accelerating AI adoption, though execution risk remains until capacity and yield at leading-edge nodes normalize.
CFO Zinsner said, ""We may actually be at our peak in terms of shortages in Q1,"" and expects supply conditions to improve after the first quarter.
Intel’s engagement with external foundry customers is supported by CapEx flexibility and existing unused assets, with leadership emphasizing capital discipline and demand-driven investment.
Management stated this ""is a multiyear initiative,"" regarding the intent to deliver annual generations of AI inference-optimized GPUs with enhanced memory and bandwidth for enterprise customers.
The Intel 14A node is receiving increased customer engagement and technical improvements, contributing to management’s growing confidence after previously signaling potential strategic reconsideration, as discussed in the Q3 2025 earnings call.
The Foundry segment’s improvement in operating loss in Q3 was primarily due to the absence of an $800 million impairment charge, not from underlying profitability gains.
On product transition, Zinsner observed that, despite AI PC shipments approaching 100 million units by the end of the year, unexpected demand for older nodes and platforms continues to absorb limited supply.
Gross margin trajectory will be heavily influenced by ramp timing and scale improvements on newer nodes (18A, 14A), with near-term dilution expected from higher new product and startup costs layered over multiple process generations; recent gross margin commentary and guidance have been provided on a non-GAAP basis.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Lip Bu will open up with comments on our third quarter results as well as provide an update on our progress implementing strategic priorities. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including fourth quarter guidance, before we transition to answer your questions. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors.
Our earnings release, most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Lip Bu.
Lip-Bu Tan:
Thank you, John, and let me add my welcome this afternoon. We delivered a solid Q3 with revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share above guidance. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of improved execution delivered by the underwriting growth in our core markets and the steady progress we are making to rebuild the company. While we still have a long way to go, we are taking the right steps to create sustainable shareholder value. We significantly improved our cash position and liquidity in Q3, a key focus for me since becoming CEO in March. This includes accelerated funding from the United States government, important investments from NVIDIA and SoftBank Group, and monetizing a portion of Altera and Mobileye.
The actions we took to strengthen the balance sheet give us greater operational flexibility and position us well to continue our strategy with confidence. In particular, I'm honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and Secretary Lavnick have placed in me. Their support highlights Intel's strategic role as the only US-based semiconductor company with leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing. We are fully committed to advancing the Trump administration's vision of restoring semiconductor production and proudly welcome the US government as an essential partner in our efforts. We also made tangible progress to improve our execution this quarter.
We remain on track not only to right-size the company by year-end but also to evolve the talent mix, re-establish an engineering-first mindset, and optimize the executive and management levels across the organization. We are seeing a significant increase in day-to-day energy and collaboration as our employees return to the office after a substantial period of remote and hybrid work. Let me dive deeper into our underlying business trends. Over the course of my career, I have had the privilege of contributing to multiple waves of disruptive innovation, but I can't recall a time when I have been more excited about the future of computing and the opportunities in front of us.
We are still in the early stages of the AI revolution, and I believe Intel can and will play a much more significant role as we transform the company. This starts with our core x86 franchise, which continues to play a critical role in the age of AI. AI is clearly accelerating demand for new compute architectures, hardware, models, and algorithms. At the same time, it's fueling renewed growth of traditional compute as the underlying data and the resulting insights continue to rely heavily on our existing products. From cloud to edge, AI is driving near-term upside to our business, and it is a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth as we execute.
In addition, with unmatched compatibility, security, and flexibility by virtue of being the largest installed base of general-purpose compute, x86 is well-positioned to power the hybrid compute environment that AI workloads demand, particularly for inference edge workloads and agentic systems. It is a great starting point from which to rebuild our market position by revitalizing and rejuvenating the x86 ISA and positioning for the new era of computing with great products and partnerships. Our collaboration with NVIDIA is a prime example. We are joining forces to create a new class of products and experiences spanning multiple generations that accelerate the adoption of AI for the hyperscale, enterprise, and consumer markets.
By connecting our architectures through NVIDIA NVLink, we combine Intel CPU and x86 leadership with NVIDIA's unmatched AI and accelerated computing strengths, unlocking innovative solutions that will deliver better customer experiences and provide a beachhead for Intel in the leading AI platform of tomorrow. We need to continue to build on this momentum and capitalize on our position by improving our engineering and design execution. This includes hiring and promoting top architecture talents as well as reimagining our core roadmap to ensure it has best-in-class features. To accelerate this effort, we recently created the central engineering group, which will unify our horizontal engineering functions to drive leverage across foundational IP development, test chip design, EDA tools, and design platforms.
This new structure will eliminate duplications, improve time to decision-making, and enhance coherence across all product development. In addition, and just as important, the group will spearhead the build-out of a new ASIC and design service business to deliver purpose-built silicon for a broad range of external customers. This will not only extend the reach of our core x86 IP but also leverage our design strengths to deliver an array of solutions from general-purpose to fixed-function computing. In client, we are on track to launch our first Panther Lake SKU by year-end, followed by additional SKUs in the first half of next year.
This will help us to solidify our strong position in the notebook segment across both consumer and enterprise with cost-optimized products across our full PC stack, from our entry-level offering to our mainstream Core family up to our highest-performing Core Ultra family. In high-end desktop, competition remains intense, but we are making steady progress throughout the year. Arrow Lake shipments have increased, and our next-generation Nova Lake product will bring new architectural and software upgrades to further strengthen our offerings, particularly in the PC gaming halo space. With this lineup, we believe we will have the strongest PC portfolio in years.
In traditional servers, AI workloads are driving both refresh of the installed base and capacity expansion, fueled by rapid growth in tokenization, the increased demands around data storage and processing, and the need to alleviate power and space constraints. We remain the AI head node of choice, with strong demand for Granite Rapids, including instances across every major hyperscaler. We are listening to what customers need, and strong performance per watt and TCO are top of mind. As I shared with you last quarter, the key part includes improving our multithreading capabilities as we close existing gaps and work to regain shares.
Finally, on our AI accelerator strategy, I continue to believe that we can play a meaningful role in developing compute platforms for emerging inference workloads driven by agentic AI and physical AI. This will be a far larger market than that for AI training workloads. We will work to position Intel as a compute platform of choice for AI inference, and we look to partner with an array of incumbents as well as emerging companies that are defining this new compute paradigm. This is a multiyear initiative, and we will strike partnerships when we can deliver true differentiation and market-leading products.
In the near term, we will continue delivering AI capabilities through Xeon, AI PCs, ARC GPUs, and our open software stack. Looking ahead, we plan to launch successive generations of inference-optimized GPUs on an annual cadence that features enhanced memory and bandwidth to meet enterprise needs. Turning to Intel Foundry, our momentum continues. We are making steady progress on Intel-18A. We are on track to bring Panther Lake to market this year. Intel 18A yields are progressing at a predictable rate, and Fab 52 in Arizona, which is dedicated to high-volume manufacturing, is now fully operational. In addition, we are advancing our work on Intel 18AP, and we continue to hit our PDK milestones.
Our Intel 18A family is the foundation for at least the next three generations of client and server products. Our work with the US government within the secure enclave and other committed customers is a critical node that will drive wafer volumes well into the next decade and generate a healthy return on our investment. On Intel 14A, the team continues to focus on technology definition, transistor architecture, process flow, design enablement, and foundation IPs. We remain actively engaged with potential external customers and are encouraged by the early feedback, which helps us to drive and inform our decisions. Lastly, our advanced packaging activities continue to progress well, especially in areas like EMIB and EMIB-T, where we have true differentiation.
Like our Intel products, my conviction in the market potential for Intel Foundry continues to grow. The rapid expansion of critical AI infrastructure is fueling unprecedented demand for wafer capacity and advanced packaging services. That presents a substantial opportunity demanding multiple suppliers. Intel Foundry is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this unprecedented demand as we execute. As I mentioned last quarter, our investment in foundry will be disciplined, and we will focus on capability and scalability, giving us flexibility to ramp quickly, and we will only add capacity when we have committed external demand. Building a world-class foundry is a long-term effort founded on trust.
As a foundry, we need to ensure that our process can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with their unique way of building their own products. We must learn to delight our customers as they count on us to build wafers to meet all their needs for power, performance, yield, cost, and schedule. It is only by doing this that they can rely on us as a true long-term partner to ensure their success. This requires a change of mindset that I'm driving across Intel Foundry as we position this business for long-term success.
As we look ahead, my focus remains firmly on the long-term opportunity across every market we serve today and those we will enter tomorrow. Our strategy is crystallized around our unique strengths and value proposition, supported by the accelerating and unprecedented demand for compute in the AI-driven economy. Our leadership continues to strengthen. Our culture is becoming more accountable, collaborative, and execution-oriented. And my confidence in the future grows stronger every day. I look forward to keeping you updated as we advance our journey. I will now turn it over to Dave for details on our current business trends and financials.
David Zinsner:
Thank you, Lip Bu. In Q3, we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue above our guidance, driven by continued strength in our core markets. Although we remain vigilant regarding macroeconomic volatility, customer purchasing behavior and inventory levels are healthy, and industry supply has tightened materially. Furthermore, we are increasingly confident that the rapid adoption of AI is driving growth in traditional compute, reinforcing momentum across our businesses. In clients, we are five years post the COVID pull-forward and are benefiting from the refresh of a larger installed base. Enterprises continue to migrate to Windows 11, and AI PC adoption is growing.
In data centers, the accelerating build-out of AI infrastructure is positive for server CPU demand from head nodes, inference, orchestration layers, and storage. We are cautiously optimistic that the CPU TAM will continue to grow in 2026, even as we have work to do to improve our competitive position. Third-quarter revenue was $13.7 billion, coming in above the high end of our guidance range and up 6% sequentially. Capacity constraints, especially on Intel 10 and Intel 7, limited our ability to fully meet demand in Q3 for both data center and client products.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 40%, four percentage points better than our guidance on higher revenue, a more favorable mix, and lower inventory reserves, partially offset by higher volume of Lunar Lake and the early ramp of Intel 18A. We delivered third-quarter earnings per share of 23¢ versus our guidance of breakeven EPS, driven by higher revenue, stronger gross margin, and continued cost discipline. Q3 operating cash flow was $2 billion, with gross CapEx of $3 billion in the quarter, and positive adjusted free cash flow of $900 million. One of our top priorities for 2025 was shoring up our balance sheet. To that end, we executed on deals to secure roughly $20 billion of cash, including three important strategic partnerships.
We exited Q3 with $30.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. In Q3, we received $5.7 billion from the US government, $2 billion from SoftBank Group, $4.3 billion from the Altera closure, and $900 million from the Mobileye stake sale. We expect NVIDIA's $5 billion investment to close by Q4. Finally, we repaid $4.3 billion of debt in the quarter, and we will continue prioritizing deleveraging by paying maturities as they come due in 2026. Moving to segment results for Q3, Intel products revenue was $12.7 billion, up 7% sequentially and above our expectations across client and server.
The team executed well to support upside in the quarter given the current tight capacity environment, which we expect to persist into 2026. We are working closely with customers to maximize our available output, including adjusting pricing and mix to shift demand towards products where we have supply and they have demand. CCG revenue was $8.5 billion, up 8% quarter over quarter and above our expectation due to a seasonally stronger TAM, Windows 11-driven refresh, and a stronger pricing mix with the ramp of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake.
Within the quarter, CCG further advanced its relationship with Microsoft through a collaboration with Windows ML and the integration of Intel vPro manageability with Microsoft Intune, enabling secure, cloud-connected fleet management for businesses of all sizes. The team also met all key milestones in support of launching Core Ultra 3, codenamed Panther Lake. We expect the client consumption TAM to approach 290 million units in 2025, marking two straight years of growth off the post-COVID bottom in 2023. This represents the fastest TAM growth since 2021, and we're prudently preparing for another year of strong demand in 2026 as Core Ultra 3 ramps into a healthy PC ecosystem.
TCAI revenue was $4.1 billion, up 5% sequentially, above expectations driven by improved product mix and higher enterprise demand. The strength in host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute continued in the quarter, even as supply constraints limited additional upside. Our latest Xeon 6 processors, codenamed Granite Rapids, offer significant benefits, including up to 68% TCO savings and up to 80% less power as compared to the average server installed today. It is increasingly clear that CPUs play a critical role today and will going forward within the AI data center as AI usage expands and especially as inference workloads outpace that of training.
Some data center customers are beginning to ask about longer-term strategic supply agreements to support their business goals due to the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure. This dynamic, combined with the underinvestment in traditional over the last couple of years, should enable the revenue TAM for server CPUs to comfortably grow going forward. Operating profit for Intel products was $3.7 billion, 29% of revenue, and up $972 million quarter over quarter on stronger product margin, lower operating expenses, and a favorable compare due to period costs in Q2. Before discussing Intel Foundry, I want to acknowledge the tireless effort of the NVIDIA and Intel teams.
There's a lot of work in front of us, but the collaboration we announced this quarter was the culmination of almost a year of hard work with a company that cuts no corners and prioritizes engineering excellence above all. The x86 architecture has been the foundation of the digital revolution that powers the modern world. AI is the next phase of that revolution, and we're on a path to ensure x86 remains at the heart of it. Engagements like this one with NVIDIA are critical to this effort. Moving to Intel Foundry, Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.2 billion, down 4% sequentially.
In Q3, Intel Foundry delivered Intel 10 and 7 volume above expectations, met key 18A milestones, and released hardened 18AP PDKs to the ecosystem. Foundry also advanced the development of Intel 14A and continues to make progress expanding its advanced packaging deal pipeline. Intel Foundry's operating loss in Q3 was $2.3 billion, better by $847 million sequentially, primarily on favorable comparison due to the approximately $800 million impairment charge in Q2. As Lip Bu discussed, our confidence in the long-term 10x increase of gigawatts of AI capacity by 2030 creates significant opportunities for Intel Foundry with external customers both for wafers and our differentiated advanced packaging capabilities like EMIB-T.
We continue the work to earn the trust of our customers, and our improved balance sheet flexibility will allow us to quickly and responsibly respond to demand as it comes. Turning to all other, revenue came in at $1 billion, of which Altera contributed $386 million, and was down 6% sequentially due to the intra-quarter closure of Altera. The three primary components of all other in Q3 were Mobileye, Altera, and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $100 million of operating profit. Now turning to guidance. For Q4, we're forecasting a revenue range of $12.8 to $13.8 billion. At the midpoint and adjusting for the Altera deconsolidation, Q4's revenue is roughly flat quarter over quarter.
We expect Intel products up modestly sequentially but below customer demand as we continue to navigate a tight supply environment. Within Intel products, we expect CCG to be down modestly and DCAI to be up strongly sequentially as we prioritize wafer capacity for server shipments over entry-level client parts. We expect Intel Foundry revenue up quarter over quarter on increased Intel 18A revenue and its external foundry revenue up due to the deconsolidation of Altera. For all other, which now excludes Altera, we expect revenue to decline consistent with Mobileye's guidance, partially offset by sequential growth in IMS.
At the midpoint of $13.3 billion, we forecast a gross margin of approximately 36.5%, down sequentially due to product mix, the impact of the first shipments of Core Ultra 3, which has the typically higher cost you see in the early stages of a new product ramp, and the deconsolidation of Altera. We forecast a tax rate of 12% and EPS of 8¢, all on a non-GAAP basis. We expect non-controlling income to be approximately $350 million to $400 million in Q4 on a GAAP basis, and we forecast an average fully diluted share count of roughly 5 billion shares for Q4.
Moving to CapEx, we continue to anticipate 2025 gross capital investment will be approximately $18 billion, and we expect to deploy more than $27 billion of CapEx in 2025 versus $17 billion deployed in 2024. I'll wrap up by saying we exit Q3 with a significantly stronger balance sheet, solid demand in the near term, and growing confidence in our core x86 franchise as well as the longer-term opportunities in foundry, ASICs, and accelerators. We also recognize the work we need to do to reach our full potential. We continue to add external talent and unlock our workforce to improve our execution across product and process development as well as manufacturing.
We will closely manage what's in our control, react quickly as the environment evolves, and focus on delivering long-term shareholder value. At this time, I'll turn it back to John to start the Q&A.
John Pitzer:
Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore:
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on strong results. Lip Bu, the first one for you is gonna be on the foundry side. You guys announced a ton of collaboration in the quarter. You very much strengthened your balance sheet. And the tone you took in your preamble sounds much more confident on the progress you're making in foundry. Do any of these collaborative announcements or equity investments go into that increased confidence, or are there some sort of technical merits that you're seeing that are raising your optimism in that part of your business?
Lip-Bu Tan:
Yeah, Ross, thank you so much for the questions. So I think a couple of announcements we made are clearly more on the product side. And also one is the SoftBank because they are building up all the infrastructure, AI infrastructure that definitely would need more capacity on the foundry side. So I think that would be the answer. Meanwhile, I think saying that, you know, I think clearly from what I've received from the 18A and 14, we make tremendous good progress. You know, the steady progress on 18A. And Panther Lake will depend on it.
And then clearly, see the yield in a more predictable way and I visit Fab 52 that, you know, fully in operation for the 18A. And then on the 14A, clearly, while engaging with multiple customers in terms of milestone basis, and we also really driving some of the yield and performance reliability that I see improvement. And also more exciting, advanced packaging, we also see important demands from some of the key customers from foundry, from the cloud, and also enterprise side. I think overall, I think we are looking quite excited to build this long-term trust with some of the customers and scaling it.
And we also focus on hiring some of the top talent driving some of the process technology improvement.
John Pitzer:
Ross, do you have a follow-up question?
Ross Seymore:
Yeah, I do. One for Dave on the gross margin side of things. You talked through the upside in the third quarter and the sequential downside in the fourth. But could you just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses as we think about 2026? Just kind of directionally? And I guess where I'm going is it seems like the biggest improvement has to come on the foundry gross margin side of things. Is that the biggest driver? What drives it? And as those gross margins go up, does that have any impact on the Intel products gross margin?
David Zinsner:
Yeah, sure, Ross. So, you know, obviously, we're not gonna guide '26, but I think I can give a little bit of color. I think first of all, just be mindful that '26, they ran a large part of the numbers for '25. So that's probably a point of margin headwind for us because they were accretive to our gross margin. So, that's gonna be a little bit of a challenge to overcome it. I'd say, you know, we still believe in this 40 to 60% fall through for margins. Of course, it's a little bit of a range you could drive a truck through quite honestly, but a lot of it's because of mix.
I mean, we'll have, you know, obviously, Lunar Lake will be a big component in the at least in the first half of the year, and that is a dilutive product to us. And then Panther Lake, you know, while obviously is going to be a great cost structure for us over time, given the wafers are fabbed internally, you know, initially, obviously, when you're when you got a new product, on a new process, you know, they're pretty expensive products to start with. And so, it's dilutive, you know, in the beginnings, of the year, and then it gets and then it gets better over the course of the year. I do agree.
You know, we should see gross margins improve on the foundry side for sure. Partly that is the scale dynamic that we will see benefit from. But also, you know, as we move towards more leading-edge mix. In '18A for sure, but also even Intel 403, those products have better pricing and a better cost structure. And so those margins should be accretive. And, really, you know, the dynamic about how much it improves will largely be a function of, you know, how the mix plays out through the year.
John Pitzer:
Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joseph Moore:
Great. Thank you. I was really interested in a lot of the prepared remarks around the sort of differences to your approach to foundry, and you talked about this last quarter and this quarter that you're sort of looking for customer commitments before you make the investment. You just talk about how those conversations are going? And I certainly, you know, I can see the trade-off from a customer standpoint. They're making a commitment to you. Do they expect that capacity to be built ahead of time? Just is there a bit of a chicken and egg aspect to these investments? And just how are you approaching those conversations?
Lip-Bu Tan:
Joseph, thank you so much for the question. I think on the foundry side, clearly, we are engaging with multiple customers. And as the building the trust of the customer, you need to really show the yield improvement reliability and also you need to have all the in those specific IP that they require. It's a service industry. Need to have all the right IP. That's why I formed the central engineering to get all the right IP to match with the customer requirement. And then the, you know, think the best way is really show the performance, the yield, and then we can get the test chip so that they can really work on it.
And then they can start to deploy their most important revenue wafer to depend on us so that we can drive their success for them. So I think those are very important. In terms of potential investment and collaboration, I think, with the different customer, different requirement. While working with them, but more important is to get their commitment to the foundry and the support. I think that's building the trust that's more important.
David Zinsner:
Yeah. Maybe just to add on, I would say that, you know, I think customers understand that it takes time from the time you deploy capital to the time where you have output. And so, you know, our expectation is we, you know, we'll get those commitments firmed up in time to deploy the capital, in time to meet the demand. I'd also say we're in a reasonably decent position given the CapEx we've already made. So we have a lot of the assets on the books, and what we call assets under construction. We've made a lot of investments around the shelf space.
So we do see line of sight to driving a reasonable amount of supply for our external foundry customers with our existing footprint. And quite honestly, with the use of the assets under construction and reuse of equipment that we have on the books today. So I think we have flexibility. Obviously, if things go better, you know, we may be looking to invest more and do that more quickly, but we feel reasonably confident we can react to the situation.
John Pitzer:
Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
Joseph Moore:
I do. Yes. Separately, the supply constraints in server CPUs and other CPUs, we see those in the market. I guess, you know, but your growth was 5% sequentially. Single-digit growth year on year. I guess, where is the shortage coming from? Is there just better demand ahead that you're not able to meet? Is it some of the transitions that you guys have made? Just, you know? And I certainly see that tightness in the marketplace, so I'm not arguing with it. But I'm just curious, you know, where you see that shortage coming from. How it'll get resolved.
David Zinsner:
Yeah. I mean, the shortage is pretty much across our business, I would say. We are definitely tight on Intel 10 and 7. Obviously, we're not looking to build more capacity there, and so as we get more demand, we're constrained. In some ways, we're living off of inventory. We're also trying to kind of demand shape to get customers to other products. There's also shortages even beyond our specific challenges on the foundry side. You think there's widely reported substrate shortages, for example. So, you know, obviously, I think the demand, you know, there's a lot of caution coming into the year, I think, across the board.
And it looks like things are going to be stronger this year, and probably that continues well into next year, and, you know, I think everybody is, you know, trying to manage through it.
John Pitzer:
Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse:
Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a follow-up on the current outlook for demand outpacing supply into 2026. Curious if that's a comment largely focused on server or also including client. And I guess depending on your thoughts there, how should we be thinking about Q1 trends versus normal seasonality, which typically, I guess, would be down high single digits, low double digits?
David Zinsner:
Yeah. It's both. Although, as we said, you know, we are yielding a bit of the small core market and client to fulfill customer requirements more broadly and on the client space and more specifically in the server space. So that's how we're kind of managing it. You know, as you look into Q1, obviously, again, this is something we'll probably give you a lot more color around in January. I would just say, you know, we may actually be at our peak in terms of shortages in the first quarter.
Because we've lived through Q3 and Q4 with a little bit of inventory to help us and, you know, just cranking out as much as we could with the factory. You know, we probably won't have as much of that luxury in Q1. So I'm not sure we'll buck the trend on seasonality given the fact that, you know, we're gonna be really, really tight in the first quarter. After that, I think we'll start to see some improvements and, you know, we can get ourselves caught up as we get through the rest of the year.
John Pitzer:
C.J., do you have a follow-up question?
C.J. Muse:
I do, John. Thank you. I guess given the investments from the US government, NVIDIA, SoftBank, etcetera, I'm curious with that improved cash position and liquidity, how has your thinking evolved in terms of investments in either CapEx or making other investments in your product businesses?
David Zinsner:
Yeah. I mean, obviously, we're in a great position. I'd say, you know, as we think about this cash, our first focus is to delever. I mean, that's one of the things we really wanted to, you know, when Lip Bu came in, he really was upset about the balance sheet, so we've done a lot to work on that and improve that for him. We took $4.3 billion of debt off the books this quarter. And all the maturities next quarter or next year should come off, and we'll repay that. I think as you look at CapEx, it puts us in a bit of a position of flexibility on CapEx.
But we want to be very disciplined around CapEx. So we will absolutely be looking at demand. Lip Bu has been very direct with us on this. He wants to see the whites of the eyes of the customer that we can believe in that demand. And if that demand exists, of course, we will amp up the CapEx as necessary. You know, as you think about investment, we still think that $16 billion of OpEx investment for next year is the right amount. Although Lip Bu and I are constantly now looking at how we mix that $16 billion to drive the best possible growth and return for investors, and we will be making those changes.
You know, beyond that, we'll see how things go. You know, we want to be pretty disciplined about our OpEx as a percent of revenue and drive leverage. But we do see opportunities to make investments that can, I think, deliver great returns for shareholders, and we're not afraid to do that either.
John Pitzer:
Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Jefferies. Your question, please?
Blayne Curtis:
Hey, thanks. I had two. Just on the CapEx, I think you reiterated $18 billion, but I think you spent, I guess, less than I was modeling Q3. So is that really still a number? And I'm just kind of curious, as you start to ramp this 18A in Arizona, is the way to think about the timing of when you add capacity there?
David Zinsner:
On the $18 billion, yeah, I think that's still the number. You know, obviously, CapEx can be lumpy. It depends on when things get, you know, when all the requirements associated with paying the invoice are completed, that's when we make the payments. And so we would expect to be somewhere in that range. Obviously, you know, an error bar around that. It might be a little bit less or a little bit more than that. 18A, you know, we still have to ramp this. I wouldn't expect significant capacity increases in the near term. But I think as we said, we are not at peak supply for 18A.
In fact, we don't get there until the end of the decade, and we do think that this node will be a fairly long-lived node for us. And so we will continue to make investments on 18A over time. There will be CapEx investments next year. But I wouldn't expect the supply to, you know, at capacity to significantly change vis-a-vis our expectations right now.
John Pitzer:
Do you have a quick follow-up?
Blayne Curtis:
Yeah. Thanks, John. I just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin trajectory as 18A layers in. I know, you know, comparing it to probably the prior couple nodes, not a great compare, but maybe do a successful one. When you say yields are in a good spot and improving, is there a way to think about where those 18A yields are versus a successful product that you've seen in your history and, you know, kind of thinking about how that layers in the first half?
David Zinsner:
Yeah. I would say, in general, I'm not sure yields and older nodes have been a big focus of ours, quite honestly. So we're blazing a new trail on this. You know, yields are what I would say yields are adequate to address the supply. But they are not where we need them to be in order to drive the appropriate level of margins. And, you know, by the end of next year, we'll probably be in that space, and, certainly, the year after that, I think they'll be in what would be kind of an industry-acceptable level on the yield.
I would tell you on 14A, you know, we're off to a great start, and if you look at 14A, in terms of its maturity, relative to 18A at that same point of maturity, we're better in terms of performance and yield. So we're off to an even better start on 14A. We just gotta, you know, kind of continue that progress.
John Pitzer:
Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon:
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to go back and ask about these supply constraints again. So you talked a lot about how AI was driving a lot of demand across servers and across PCs. But at the same time, it doesn't look like customers want your AI products. In fact, they can't get enough of the older stuff. So I guess you must have plenty of supply for Granite and for Meteor and even for Lunar Lake. So how are you gonna get the customers off of the older products where they haven't shown any desire to get off of them so far even given the constraints that they've been under?
And I guess, how do we think about the transition of those customers? Because you're clearly, I mean, you even said it yourself. You're not adding any more of the older capacity. In fact, you took some of it offline. Right?
David Zinsner:
Good question, Stacy. I would think it's a misnomer to say AI hasn't done well. I mean, it was sequentially up double digits quarter over quarter, and, you know, we've talked about a number of about, you know, we would ship about 100 million units by the end of this year on AI PC, and we're gonna be first order in that range. So I think it's going pretty well. Clearly, though, the older nodes have also done well, and that was probably the part that was more unexpected. You know, I think we've just gotta, you know, participate in, you know, making sure that the ecosystem drives enough applications for AI in the PC space.
And, you know, we work with the ISVs regularly to drive that. You know, they're getting there. It's, you know, like any market, it starts relatively immature and kind of builds out over time. But even in our company, we're starting to find uses for AI PC. In fact, IR is coming up with one here that we'll be using. So, you know, it's just, you know, kind of time. Now that said, you know, what clearly is happening is the Windows refresh is happening more significantly than I think we expected, and, you know, that's not necessarily an AI PC story, and, you know, so Raptor Lake is also a product that addresses that.
And so, you know, we're just seeing upside in that part of the market as well.
John Pitzer:
Stacy, do you have a follow-up?
Stacy Rasgon:
I do. Thank you. Dave, I want to follow-up on two things that I think I heard you say on 18A. I thought I heard you say, number one, that yields would not be in a great place at least until the end of next year. And then I thought I also heard you say that you were not gonna be adding a lot of 18A capacity next year. Did I hear those wrong? I mean, how can especially the latter one, how can that be true if you're ramping Panther? Or is that, like, a consequence?
David Zinsner:
We're at our infant, and what I'm saying is, you know, relative to the CapEx plan, it's not like we're going to incrementally add supply for 18A next year. But, yes, of course, we're going to be ramping the volume over the course of the next year. Yeah. I wouldn't say 18A yields are in a bad place. I mean, they're where we want them to be at this point. We had a goal for the end of the year, and they're gonna hit that goal. But to be, you know, fully accretive in terms of the cost structure of 18A, we need the yield to be better. I mean, that's like every process. That's what happens.
And it's gonna take all of next year, I think, to really get to a place where that's the case.
John Pitzer:
Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Joshua Buchalter:
I want to ask about some comments Lip Bu made in the prepared remarks about fixed-function computing and potentially supporting more ASICs. Was this maybe could you provide more context on the scope of this? Is this for potential foundry customers, or are these products? And if it's products, you know, what types of applications do you expect to be supporting with custom silicon? Thank you.
Lip-Bu Tan:
Good question. So I think, first of all, I mentioned about the central engineering. We are driving the ASIC design. And that will be a good opportunity for us to enhance, extend our reach of the core x86 IP and also drive some of the purpose-built silicon for some of our system and cloud players and customers. And then definitely with the foundry and packaging also that were helping us in terms of their requirement. So in all in all, I think this AI will be driving a lot of growth, especially in the double down, the Moore's Law, and that will help us a lot in our x86 uplift.
And then there's an opportunity for us to build the whole ASIC design to serve some of the customer requirements.
John Pitzer:
Josh, do you have a quick follow-up?
Joshua Buchalter:
Yeah. So on the last quarter, obviously, the disclosure that, you know, you may decide to abandon 14A got a lot of attention. I just wanted to ask, you know, given your balance sheet is in a lot different spot than it was three months ago, has anything changed from that regard? I mean, I don't think Q's out, so I haven't seen if any of the language changed there. I was curious if anything, you know, had moved around since last quarter given all the changes in your balance sheet.
Lip-Bu Tan:
Yeah. Since the last balance quarter, I think clearly, our engagement with the customer for 14A has increased. And we are very heavily engaging with the customer in terms of defining the technology, the process, the yield, and the IP requirement to serve them. And they clearly see the tremendous demand that they need to have Intel to be strong on the 14A. And so we are delighted and more confident. Meanwhile, we're also attracting some of the key talent for the process technology that can really drive success. And that's why it gives me a lot more confidence to drive that.
John Pitzer:
Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius. Your question, please?
Ben Reitzes:
Hey. Thanks, guys. Lip Bu, can we get an update on the NVIDIA relationship? Timing of products? Have you gotten any feedback from customers in terms of, you know, your ability to articulate on the materiality of the relationship and in terms of timing and materiality or any other color you want to give us on that? Thanks so much.
Lip-Bu Tan:
Sure. Thank you. And this is a very important collaboration with NVIDIA. It's a great company, as you guys know, and I've been known as a friend of Jensen for more than thirty years. And we are very excited about this effort of Intel CPU x86 leadership and their unmatched AI and X-ray computing and then connecting with the NVLink, and that would really create a new class of product in the multigenerations. And this is something that very heavy engineering to engineering engagement, and that will be driving some of the new products that custom data center and PC product and that really optimize for the AI era.
So I think all in all, I think this is gonna be multiple years of engagement. And then addressing a market that is excited and also driving some of the requirements for the AI infrastructure.
David Zinsner:
And maybe just one more addition. Just what makes this really special for us is it's not attacking our existing TAM. It's an incremental opportunity for us to expand the TAM. And so, you know, just are great opportunities for us.
John Pitzer:
Ben, do you have a follow-up?
Ben Reitzes:
Yeah. Thanks, John. Lip Bu, you mentioned, you know, a little bit about your AI strategy. Now, you know, to attack the inference market, and that there's you see room for, you know, Intel solutions. And it sounds like you're gonna partner a lot there. Is this strategy more about partnering? Is it more about is there a specific Intel IP, you know, for inferencing that, you know, you're excited about, or is it more of a Switzerland approach where, you know, you could partner with a lot of the existing players out there to attack more of the TAM? Thanks.
Lip-Bu Tan:
Yes, good question. So I think, first of all, I think with the AI driving a lot of growth, we definitely want to play in that. I think this is a very early inning. So I think there's an opportunity for us. And I think one area that we are focused on is revitalizing our x86 and to really tailor to purpose-built CPU, GPU requirements for the new AI workload. And then really addressing the, you know, power-efficient, authentic, and managing all the different agents. This is a new way of compute platform of choice, and that will be also applying to the system and software.
They're gonna say to you, I think we're gonna partner with some of the incumbents and also the emerging companies that are driving some of these changes.
John Pitzer:
Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator:
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri:
Thanks a lot. Dave, it's not that often we see high fixed-cost businesses that are constrained that have gross margins less than 40%. And I certainly get that most of this is because of the wafer costs for Intel 10 and 7, and you still have low yields on 18A. But I'm wondering, and this is probably a hard question to ask but to answer, but I wonder if you could maybe just kind of fast forward a bit and say, like, what would gross margin be if you were off of 10 and 7 and you were on 18A? Is there a way you could, like, normalize it for us?
David Zinsner:
Yeah. I mean, obviously, you must be listening in on some of my conversations with the team here because that's definitely something I've been making the point of. You know, I would say there's two dynamics, one of which you're hitting on, and that is the high cost of older processes versus the better cost structure for the newer processes and, you know, that's obviously meaningful. I mean, we're in negative gross margin territory for foundry. You know, that makes a meaningful improvement. If you move it even into the positive territory. But the other aspect of our gross margins is a function of just the product quality.
We're in reasonably decent shape on clients in terms of product performance and competitiveness. You know, with a few exceptions, but we're not where we need to be on a cost basis. And so we've got to make improvements there, and we have that on the roadmap team recognizes it, but that's a multiyear process to get there. But it's more pronounced on the data center side. Not only do we not have the right cost structure, but we also don't have the right competitiveness to really get the right margins from our customers. And so we've got work to do there.
And so that's what Lip Bu and the team is pulled in are hyper-focused on is getting great products at the right cost structure to try better gross margins. That to me, I think, is the linchpin on all this. But the improvements on the foundry side are just gonna come, I think. You know, we're gonna mix higher and higher to Intel 3, 4, and then, you know, 18A and ultimately 14A. The cost structures of all of those are actually pretty similar. And, you know, it'll just be a function of the fact that the value that's provided by those leading-edge nodes is gonna be significantly more, and that's gonna, you know, materially drive the gross margins up.
The other thing that I would say is we are seeing a lot of startup costs by virtue of the fact that we've jammed a whole bunch of new processes in kind of in rapid fashion. We get into 14A, we'll our cadence will be more normalized, and so you won't see so much startup cost stacked on top of each other, which is affecting our gross margins. And, you know, that billions of dollars. I think as, you know, as you get beyond a few years, that rolls off and will also help.
John Pitzer:
Tim, do you have a quick follow-up?
Timothy Arcuri:
I do. Yeah. Lip Bu, you didn't give an update last call on, you know, Diamond Rapids launch date. I know the whole, you know, roadmap's under review, but you did sound the, you know, company sounds fairly optimistic about Coral Rapids. Can you just give us sort of an update on the data center roadmap a bit here? Thanks.
Lip-Bu Tan:
Yeah. Thank you. Good questions. So I think clearly the Diamond Rapids getting stronger hyperscaler feedback. And then we also focus on the new product, the Coral Rapids. And that will be included SMT, the microthreading that can drive higher performance. We're in the definition stage, and then we will work out the roadmap, and then we're gonna execute that, you know, going forward.
John Pitzer:
Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, we have time for one last question.
Operator:
Certainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers:
Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just a couple real quick ones. I guess going back to the NVIDIA relationship, I can appreciate that the announcement was really tied to the NVLink fusion strategy and integrating that with the x86 ecosystem. But I think there's been some also some recent reports about maybe using Gaudi for some dedicated inference workloads within a stack of NVIDIA. How do you, you know, is this relationship, you know, a starting point, and should we expect to see more potential integration beyond NVLink going forward?
Lip-Bu Tan:
Yeah. I think the let me answer that. I think NVLink is kind of more the hub to connecting the x86 and GPU. You know, in terms of the AI strategy, we clearly are defining Crescent Island that we talk about, and also we also have a new product line in the lineup they're addressing the agentic and the physical AI and more in the inference side. And so I think stay tuned. We will update that.
John Pitzer:
Aaron, do you have a quick follow-up?
Aaron Rakers:
I do, and I'll make it really short. You know, can you just update us on how we think about the non-controlling interest expense, as we look through this year and think about I think you've given some comments in the past. How we should think about that in 2026. Thank you.
David Zinsner:
Yeah. I think '26, we're looking at somewhere in the 1.2 to 1.4 range is probably a good estimate. Obviously, we're focused on that and, you know, we'll work to minimize that as much as possible.
Lip-Bu Tan:
With that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We are on the journey of rebuilding Intel. We have a lot of work ahead of us. But we are making solid progress in Q3. I look forward to seeing many of you throughout the quarter and providing you another update in January.
Operator:
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

Full Conference Call Transcript
Spencer Wang:
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Netflix, Inc. Q2 2025 earnings interview. I am Spencer Wang, VP of Finance, IR, and Corporate Development. Joining me today are Co-CEOs, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, and CFO, Spencer Neumann. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary. We will take questions submitted by the analyst community, and we will begin with our results and our forecast. The first question comes from Steve Cahall of Wells Fargo. The question is, since the revenue increase in your forecast is primarily FX driven, we are curious about the components of the constant currency increase.
Is this due to a better underlying revenue growth, or are there specific expenses that are coming in better, like content amortization? I will take that one. Thanks, Steve. So I
Spencer Neumann:
As you saw on the letter, we increased our full-year revenue guidance to $44.8 to $45.2 billion. That is up from the prior guide of $43.5 to $44.5 billion. So up about a billion at the midpoint of the range and a tighter range. As you noted, primarily reflects the FX impact from the weakening dollar relative to most other currencies. But the good news is we are also seeing strength in our underlying business. We have got healthy member growth, and that even picked up nicely at the '2 a bit more than we expected. We think that will carry through with our strong back half slate. So we are reflecting that in our latest forecast.
We are also seeing nice momentum in ad sales, still off a pretty small base, but good growth and it is on pace to roughly double our revenue in the year. And it is a bit ahead of beginning of year expectations. So when we carry all that through to operating margin, our operating expenses are essentially unchanged, which is part of your question. So they are basically unchanged forecast to forecast. So we are largely flowing through the expected higher revenues to profit margins.
So that is why our updated target full-year reported margin is up a point from 29% to 30% and that 50 basis point increase in FX neutral margin is really just that revenue lift from stronger membership growth and ads relative to prior forecast flowing through the margin.
Spencer Wang:
Thank you, Spence. We will take our next question from Barton Crockett of Rosenblatt Securities. Why is operating margin guidance for the full year only 30% after the upside in February and a forecast 31.5% for the third quarter? Is there a timing issue, FX issue, or is there a new level of spending that will continue beyond the fourth quarter of 2025?
Spencer Neumann:
Well, this is really mostly timing. So thanks, Barton. We primarily, as a reminder, manage to full-year margins. And we expect our content expenses will ramp in Q3 and Q4. We have got many of our biggest new and returning titles and live events in the back half of the year. We have also, you know, Q4 is typically a and generally almost always is a heavier film slate. Sure. We will talk about our expect we will talk about more of this on the call. Also be marketing to support that heavier slate, and we are continuing to aggressively build out our ad sales infrastructure and capabilities through the year. So all of that is to be expected.
We can manage to it. We manage to those margins. And even with that back half ramp in expenses, we expect operating margins to be up year over year in each quarter, including Q4, and as just noted, we do expect to deliver strong full-year margins as we just took up our guide to, you know, 29.5% FX neutral, 30% reported.
Spencer Wang:
Great. Thanks, Spence. The next question comes from Tom Champion of Piper Sandler. How has your view of the consumer and the macro economy changed over the last ninety days?
Spencer Neumann:
Similar to last quarter, we are carefully watching consumer sentiment in the broader
Greg Peters:
economy. But at this point, really nothing significant to note in the metrics and the indicators that we get directly through the business. Those are retention that remains stable and industry-leading. There have been no significant shifts in plan mix or plan take rate. And the price changes we have done since the last quarter have been in line with expectations. Engagement also remains healthy. So things all look stable from those indicators and big picture entertainment in general and Netflix, Inc. specific have been historically pretty resilient in tougher economic times.
We also think that we are an incredible entertainment value not only compared to traditional entertainment, but if you think about streaming competitors, when we start at $7.99 in The United States, you think about all the entertainment you get we have a belief and expectation that demand for not only entertainment but for us specifically will remain strong.
Spencer Wang:
Thanks, Greg. I think a nice follow-up to this question will be on advertising. So from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley, can you share any data points around your upfront negotiations?
Greg Peters:
Yep. As we noted in the letter, our US upfront is nearly complete. We have closed a large majority of deals with the major agencies. Those results have generally been in line or slightly better than our targets and consistent with our goal to roughly double the ads business this year. And what are advertisers excited about? Growing scale is something we definitely hear. Also, a highly engaged audience. So bigger audience, but also an audience that is more engaged relative to our peers. The rollout of our own ad tech stack, which helps deliver a bunch of features, and then our slate, which is generally amazing and includes a growing number of live events that advertisers are excited about.
Spencer Wang:
Great. Follow-up question on advertising from Vikram of Baird. How have advertisers in The US responded to the Netflix, Inc. ads suite rollout since the April launch? What features and capabilities are attracting the most interest, and how is the initial feedback in other regions outside of The US?
Greg Peters:
We have completed the rollout of our own ad tech stack and the Netflix, Inc. ad suite to all of our ad markets now. So we are fully on our own stack around the world at this point. That rollout was generally smooth across all countries. We see good performance metrics across all countries, and the early results are in line with our expectations. Now we are in this phase of learning and improving quickly based on the fact that being live everywhere means that you get a bunch of feedback about what we can do better, which is great.
As we mentioned before, the most immediate benefit from this rollout is just making it easier for advertisers to buy on Netflix, Inc. We hear that benefit, that ease, from direct feedback talking to advertisers. They tell us that it is easier. See it in our overall sales performance. We have seen an increased programmatic buying. So all of these are consistent, you know, with what we were expecting both qualitatively and from a metrics perspective. We are also, I guess, worth noting that we are going to roll out additional demand sources like Yahoo that will further open up the market for us.
Long term, being on our own stack, that improves the speed of our execution to deliver this, you know, pretty significant roadmap of features that we have in front of us. It is things like improved targeting and measurement. There is also leveraging advertiser and third-party data which we definitely hear demand for as well. And it will ultimately allow us to improve the ad experience for our members. Which is critically important. So that means better ads personalization. So the ads that I see are increasingly different from the ads that, let us say, Ted would see.
And they are more relevant for each of us, which is good for us as users, and it is good for the brands. Also going to be introducing interactivity in the second half of the year, so that is exciting. So that is all to say this is, you know, a pretty significant milestone for us, one we are super excited to get behind us because now we can shift into this steady release cycle where we are dropping new features all the time, both for advertisers and for members. And that is the development and release that we have in other parts of the business. So it is fun to be able to get to that point.
Spencer Wang:
Thanks, Greg. I will move this along now to a set of questions around content as engagement. This one comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. 1% engagement growth year over year suggests engagement is down year over year on an average per member basis. How do we reconcile that with engagement growing on a per member household basis if that is still accurate?
Greg Peters:
So total view hours did grow a bit in the first half of 2025, and that is despite a particularly back half-weighted slate. But to your point on engagement on a per member basis, we have mostly been focused for the last few years on measuring engagement on what we call an owner household basis. So this takes out the borrower effect, and we obviously think this is the best way to assess our engagement per member because it removes the tricky comparison impacts from paid sharing.
So that metric per owner household engagement has been relatively steady over the past two and a half years throughout the rollout of paid sharing, and amidst increasing competition for TV time as more viewing moves to streaming and gets this on-demand benefit. So we are glad to have held that normalized engagement level, but we clearly also want to increase it. And to that end, we are optimistic and expect that our engagement growth in the second half of this year will be better than in the first half given our strong second half slate.
Spencer Wang:
Thanks, Greg. Great segue to Doug Inmuth's question from JPMorgan. The content in the back half of the year looks strong with Squid Game 3 already the third most popular non-English series ever, and Wednesday and Stranger Things releasing in the coming months. You often say that no single title drives more than 1% of total viewing. So how do you think about the business currently as being quote, hit boosted or hit driven, and are you confident that both original and licensed content momentum can continue in 2026?
Ted Sarandos:
Yeah. I will take that. And thank you, Doug. On the first part of your question, we are definitely riding this long-term trend of linear to streaming. And that has a natural adoption curve. But we can accelerate our growth with big hits. But as you said, each one of them, even in success, is going to drive about 1% of total viewing. So you need a lot more than just a big hit every once in a while. So to your point, it is not about the single hit. So what it is about a steady drumbeat of shows and films and soon enough games that our members really love and continue to expect from us.
So, like, by way of example, we had 44 individual shows nominated for Emmys this year. So that is what quality at scale looks like. We ended the quarter with a huge return to Squid Game. Thanks for acknowledging. I will go into the second half with the return of Wednesday and Stranger Things. And a really strong slate of supporting titles and favorites, like and new shows. Like next week or this week, we have Eric Bonnett's Untamed. Next week, we have Leanne Morgan's new comedy show Leanne. Both look really great. And that is just to name a few.
And the back half of the year also has perhaps the most anticipated slate of new movies that we have ever had. That starts on the 25th with Happy Gilmore 2, followed by we have a new Knives Out film. We have new films from Noah Baumbach, from Guillermo del Toro, from Catherine Bigelow. And it does not stop there. It does roll right into 2026, and that is the second part of your question. And we are looking forward to movies like the rip from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Shirley starred on a new movie called Apex, which is a phenomenal action movie. Millie Bobby Brown is back in Enola Holmes 3.
Recall that in 2023, Enola Holmes 2 was our biggest movie. So we are looking forward to that new sequel.
Spencer Wang:
And Greta Gerwig's Narnia is going to be phenomenal.
Ted Sarandos:
And then on top of that, we talk about Return of Bridgerton, One Piece, Avatar: The Last Airbender, all three huge successes around the world. The Gentleman, Four Seasons, Point Break, I am sorry, Running Points. Sorry. Beef, which as you recall in 2023, won just about every award imaginable and was a gigantic success for us. It is back for a new season in '26. Three Body Problem, Love is Blind, Outer Banks, and not just from The US, from France, we have LuPan. From Spain, we have Berlin. We have a new season of a hundred years of from Colombia. So big hit returning shows and new series. From each of our regions around the world.
And the new stuff we have got coming up like man on fire, reimagining of little house on the prairie, The Duffer brothers from Stranger Things have a brand new show. The Burrows. We have got the Human Vapor from Japan. Operation Safred Cigar from India, can this love be translated from Korea? So again, popular programming, new and returning from all over the world in 2026. Unscripted shows like the reboot of Star Search, we have got into the doll universe. With Wonka's golden ticket, which we are really excited about.
In our live, we have got a few surprises for you next year, but of course, we have our NFL Christmas Day doubleheader that we are really thrilled about too. So we are really incredibly excited about the back half of this year and confident that it keeps rolling in 26.
Spencer Wang:
Thank you, Ted. We will take the next question from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. Who asks, are you concerned by the stagnation in your viewing share domestically?
Spencer Neumann:
Think Rich is probably referring to the Nielsen gauge data. Do you need to spend more on programming or spend differently to materially move your viewing share higher?
Ted Sarandos:
Yeah. Thanks, Rich. Look, our goal continues to be to continue to grow our share over the long term. And over the past few years, you are right, we have been able to maintain our share even as we work through a growing number of TV-based streaming services, some free, some paid. And the impact of paid sharing that Greg mentioned earlier as well as this, you know, 2025 slate that was more back half-weighted than we typically have in previous years. But over the long term, we tend to keep growing as the other 50% of TV viewing migrates from linear to streaming. And we will do that by doing what we have always done, continuously improve the service.
ADVERTISEMENT
So in mind, since 2020, our content amort has grown more than 50%. You know, from under $11 billion to more than $16 billion. That we expect to do this year. And over that same time period, we definitely had we saw a big increased spending, but also increased engagement. Increased revenue, increased profit, and increased profit margin. So that is our model in action.
It is our objective to sustain healthy revenue growth, reinvest in the business to improve on all aspects of the service, and that includes growing content spend, strengthening expanding the entertainment offering, and to drive that positive flywheel of growth by adding value to our members and all the while growing engagement revenue and profit around the world.
Spencer Wang:
Great. Thank you, Ted. I will move to Alan Gould from Loop Capital next. Can you provide more information on the TF1 partnership? Why did you choose to add TF1 in France as opposed to other broadcasters as your first partner, why is now the right time to create such a partner? Should we anticipate similar partnerships in other countries?
Greg Peters:
Yeah. Perhaps to start with the rationale for the partnership. You would think with that long list of amazing titles that Ted just rattled off, we would have enough to satisfy every person on the planet. But it turns out we actually consistently hear from our members that they want more. They want more variety, more breadth of content. So the fundamental purpose for this TF1 partnership is all about that goal. Of expanding our entertainment offering. How do we enhance the value we deliver to members? Want to provide more content, more variety, more quality. So just as you have seen us do with licensing and production, this is just another mechanism to expand that offering.
And in this case, it is specifically about highly relevant local for local content in a country that has strong demand for that local content. This is an accelerated way to satisfy that need. Why now? Why was this time the right time? Well, we have invested a lot in a bunch of enabling capabilities that are either required or highly leveraged by this deal. You can think live, ads, the new UI, among other things. And then why TF1 versus some other partner? Well, we know each other really well. We wanted our first partner to be in a big territory. We wanted to pick the leading local programmer.
We wanted to be highly aligned in terms of the deal and the shape of the partnership and the values that we thought we could generate mutually by working together for our customers. And we both look at this as an opportunity to learn, to figure out how do we scale the local content that TF1 is producing to more customers in France. So we are looking forward to seeing what consumers think. You never really know until you get out there and get the real reactions. And then, obviously, we will factor that into our plans going forward.
Ted Sarandos:
Thanks, Greg.
Spencer Wang:
From Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson, with reports suggesting Apple is now in the driver's seat for F1 rights. Uh-huh. Unintended, I guess. Plus UFC and MLB still looking for new deals and the NFL may be looking to come to market a year earlier. Can you share updated thoughts on how you are approaching sports rights for Netflix, Inc. and where you draw the line on something that can move the needle?
Ted Sarandos:
Wow. Thanks for that, Robert. Remember, sports are a subcomponent of our live strategy. But our live strategy goes beyond sports alone. Our live strategy and our sports strategy are unchanged. You know, we remain focused on ownable big breakthrough events that because our audiences really love them. Anything we chase in the event space or in the sports space has got to make economic sense as well. You know, we bring a lot to the table, the deals that we make have to reflect that. So live is a relatively small part of the total content spend. And we have got about 200 billion view hours.
So it is a pretty small part of view hours as well right now. That being said, not all view hours are equal. And what we have seen with live is it has outsized positive impacts around conversation, around acquisition, and we suspect around retention. And but so right now, we are very excited where we sit. Very excited with the existing strategy. We are excited about the Canela Crawford fight and September and the SAG Awards and our weekly WWE matches. And the NFL, of course, which is a great property, and we are happy to have Christmas Day doubleheader, which includes Dallas versus Washington. And Detroit versus Minnesota.
So today, our live events have all primarily been in The US, keep in mind. So over time, we are going to continue to invest and grow our live capabilities for events around the world in the years ahead. So we are excited, but the strategy is unchanged.
Spencer Wang:
Thanks, Ted. Good follow-up question on that one from Steve Cahall of Wells Fargo. What investments have you made to increase your capabilities in producing live events? What have you been able to do in-house in 2025 that you could not do last year? And how long will it take before you have the capability to produce large-scale events like NFL games?
Ted Sarandos:
Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I would say remember, when we started original scripted programming, we had zero production capability. House of Cards was in fact thinking about our first three years of original programming, all of those shows were produced by others. Have to go three years later, we have produced Stranger Things in-house. Today, we still have shows that are produced by others. Universal, Twentieth Television, which is Disney, Paramount, Lionsgate, Warner Television, there is lots of available infrastructure to produce TV. And that is true of live events and sports as well. If we when we do more and more, we may choose to bring some of that in-house.
We have already produced a few, and we are just as likely to continue to use partners with existing production infrastructure and work to make sure that those productions are bespoke and they feel like they could only be on Netflix, Inc. So you should not think about the mix of partnerships and self-producing as a we think about it as a scaling tool. Not backfilling some, like, lack of ability in some area of the company. So and I should note by example, CBS is a phenomenal partner producing NFL games with us, and we are thrilled to work with them again this year on Christmas Day.
Greg Peters:
Maybe take this opportunity just to some commentary on the general capability we have been building with live. Know, when we start something new, we pretty much expect that we are not going to be brilliant at it at the beginning. What? But we yeah. That is true. And we do not have any real reason to believe that. But we do not let that stop us from kicking off initiatives that we believe have a strong strategic rationale even though we know we need to develop that capability. Of course, our job is to get out there and learn by doing and get world-class as quickly as we possibly can.
And if you look at our current capabilities around live, we are in just a completely different place today compared to when we first started. As a good example that just happened last Friday, we had our first concurrent pair of live events. We had Taylor versus Serrano globally delivered alongside WWE SmackDown, was delivered ex-US. Both events at scale and delivered with extremely high quality. So it is great progress we have seen, and we have got a great roadmap ahead of us to continue to enhance those experiences. For folks.
Spencer Wang:
Thank you both. Last question on the content side or the topic of content comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. What are the learnings from the success of K-Pop Demon Hunters? More animated musicals with fictional bands, question mark. That is a question from a man who probably has that movie playing on repeat in their home if I am guessing correctly. K-Pop Demon Hunters is a phenomenal success out of the gate. One of the things that I am really proud of the team over
Ted Sarandos:
is original animation, not sequel, not live-action remake. Original animation feature is very tough and has been struggling for years. And I think the fact that our biggest hits now, Leo, Seabeast, and now K-Pop Demon Hunters, are original animation. So we are super thrilled about that. The mix of music and pop culture, getting it right matters. Good storytelling matters. The innovation in animation itself matters. And the fact that people are in love with this film and in love with the music from this film that will keep it going for a long time. So we are really thrilled. And now the next beat is where does it go from here?
So know, we put in the letter how just how successful the music has been. And continues to be, and we think that will drive fandom for this fictional K-Pop band that we have. But more importantly, for the song Golden and for the song Soda Pop, these are enormous hits, and they all came from a film that is available only on Netflix, Inc. So we are really excited that we can pierce the culture with original animated features considering that folks have been poking us on it.
Spencer Neumann:
Let us do it again later in the year within your dreams. Right, Ted? Absolutely. In your dreams, another very
Ted Sarandos:
funny one and also completely original. So Yeah.
Spencer Wang:
Great. I will move us on now to a few questions on plans as well as product. So from Michael Morris of Guggenheim, he asks, Netflix, Inc. continues to broaden content genres notably with live sports and the recently announced TF1 partnership. Is there a path to additional tiers of service based on types of content available, or will Netflix, Inc. always make all content available at the ad-free/ad-supported price points?
Greg Peters:
I have learned to never say never, so I would say we remain open to evolving our consumer-facing model. Think we have got a few principles, important principles that we are carrying with us that I do not see changing significantly. One is we want to provide members choice. Right? So how do we have a different set of plans, a different price points, different features that allows folks to opt in to what is the right Netflix, Inc. for them. Also, how do we provide good accessibility to new members around the world? We want to grow, and that means making that we have got accessible price points.
And then finally, the plans we offer, they have to know, ensure that we are having reasonable returns to the business based on the entertainment value that we deliver, and we are hoping to grow those and so those returns would grow as well. Now obviously, the reason to do that is we can continue to reinvest in adding more entertainment and building a better experience. And maybe one other thought too is there is a component of complex in ChoiceDax that we have to consider in how we think about our offering. It is structured. So having said all that, though, I think we believe that the bundle is a great value for members.
It allows members around the world to access a wide range of entertainment in a very easy way at a very reasonable price. So I would expect that will remain an important feature of our offering for the foreseeable future.
Ted Sarandos:
A lot of value and simplicity.
Spencer Neumann:
Yeah.
Spencer Wang:
Great. From Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners, help us understand why your new UI/UX is so important as you expand live content. Beyond live, can you provide some color on what metrics have improved since the launch of the new UI, such as speed of users finding a title and change in failed sessions.
Greg Peters:
As we said previously, it is really hard for a new UI to immediately compete, be better than the UI that we have had for the past ten years that has been iteratively evolved and improved. But now that we have actually rolled out this new UI to the first large wave of TV devices, we are actually seeing performance that is better than what we saw in our prelaunch testing. To some degree, that is expected because we made some improvements based on the results of that testing phase. So it is exciting to see that those delivered actual better results.
But the rate of that change actually gives us increased confidence that this new experience will drive better performance, by the variety of metrics we look at some of which include the ones that Rich is mentioning in relatively short order. And then maybe just a point on why are why do we build this and launch this new experience the first place? Why was this so important? Bluntly, the previous experience was designed for the Netflix, Inc. of ten years ago, and the business has involved considerably since then. We got a wider breadth of entertainment options. We got TV and film, more of those, of course, from around the world, but now also games and live events.
If you think about the discovery experience that is best suited for these new content types, it is inherently different. Helping our members understand that there is a really good reason for them to launch Netflix, Inc. and tune in at 7PM on a Friday night versus just showing up whenever they were free and wanted to be entertained. That is a totally different job, and we really need a different user interface to do that job well. Add to that, we saw the opportunity to leverage newer technologies, like real-time recommendations that respond dynamically to what you need from us in that specific moment.
So the Netflix, Inc. you get on a Tuesday night is different from the Netflix, Inc. you get on a Sunday afternoon. But all of those rationales together and what we are seeing in terms of the performance so far, we are very confident that we have got a much better platform in this new user experience to build from to continue to improve, and that will help us meet the needs of the business over the years to come.
Spencer Wang:
Thanks, Greg. The next question comes from Steve Cahall of Wells Fargo. YouTube is the only streamer that exceeds Netflix, Inc. in terms of US share of TV time. Do you see an opportunity to bring notable YouTube creators and their content exclusively to Netflix, Inc.? How big could this opportunity be?
Ted Sarandos:
Thanks, Steve. Look. We want to be in business with the best creatives on the planet. Regardless of where they come from. Some of them are here in Hollywood. Others are Korea, some are in India. And some are creators that distribute only on social media platforms, and most of them have not yet been discovered. So, for those creators doing great work, we have phenomenal distribution. Desirable monetization, brilliant discovery in our UI, and a hungry audience waiting to be entertained. So Steve, you recently I think I listened to you on a podcast where you talked about our business model and on this I believe on this very topic.
And we largely agree with you and believe that working with a wide set of content creators makes a lot of sense for us. And as you said, if I am remembering it right, not everything on YouTube will fit on Netflix, Inc. We could not agree with that more. But there are some creators on YouTube like Miss Rachel that are a great fit. If you could saw on the engagement report, she said 53 million views in 2025 on Netflix, Inc. So she clearly works on Netflix, Inc. And we are really excited about the Sidemen and pop the balloon and a wide variety of and video podcasters that might be a good fit for us.
And particularly if they are doing great work and looking for different ways to connect with audiences.
Greg Peters:
And maybe broadening this out for a second, and taking that question to look at sort of all of the competitors. That we face for our share of TV time. We have always said that the market for entertainment is very large. And we face competition from all kinds of directions. So whether it is linear, or streamers or video games or social media, it is also a very dynamic, competitive market as we and all of our competitors seek to provide better and better options for consumers.
And one of those changes, one of those vectors of dynamicism has been that sort of steady inevitable shift to streaming and on-demand as more services move deliver their content in a way that we all know consumers want. That creates increasing competitive pressure for us that we have got to respond to. We also see free services as a form of strong competition. Free is very powerful from a consumer perspective. So it is not surprising that some free services are growing in engagement. But I think Ted said it well earlier in the call, not all hours are created equal. And we have a different profit model from other services, a strong profit model.
So we are going to compete to win more moments of truth for sure. But especially compete to win those most profitable moments. And back to your specific question, it is worth remembering there is about 80% of total TV view share that neither Netflix, Inc. or YouTube are winning right now. We think that represents a huge opportunity for which we are competing aggressively and we aim to grow our share.
Ted Sarandos:
The vast majority of our money and attention is focused on that 80%.
Spencer Wang:
Thank you. Next question from Justin Patterson of KeyBanc. Could you please talk about your generative AI initiatives? Where do you think GenAI will be most impactful over time, revenue or expense efficiency?
Spencer Neumann:
Well, I may take start with the with GenAI.
Ted Sarandos:
We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper. There are AI-powered creator tools. So this is real people doing real work with better tools. Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through previsualization and shot planning work and certainly visual effects. It used to be that only big-budget projects would have access to advanced visual effects like de-aging. Remember last quarter, we talked about Pedro Paramo. Well, that is just no longer the case. And, you know, this year, we had El Atonata. It is a very big hit show for us. From Argentina.
In that production, we leveraged virtual production and AI-powered VFX there was a shot in the show that the creators wanted to show a building collapsing in Buenos Aires. So our iLIGHT team iLIGHT team partnered with their creative team using AI-powered tools they were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed. And in fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with visual, traditional VFX tools and workflows. And, also, the cost of it would just not have been feasible for a show in that budget. So that sequence actually is the very first GenAI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix, Inc. original series or film.
So the creators were thrilled with the result. We were thrilled with the result. And more importantly, the audience was thrilled with the result. So I think these tools are helping creators expand the possibilities of storytelling on screen, and that is endlessly exciting.
Greg Peters:
And maybe to cover a few of the other areas. You know, the member experience is a place where we feel like there is tons of opportunity to leverage these new generative technologies to improve the experience. You know, we have been in the personalization and recommendation business for, you know, two decades. But yet we see a tremendous room and opportunity to make it even better by leveraging some of the more newer generative techniques.
We are also rolling out have piloted right now a conversational experience that uses allows our members to basically have a sort of natural language discussion with our user interface saying, you know, I want to watch a film from the eighties that is, you know, a dark psychological thriller, get some results back, maybe iterate through those in a way that you just could not have done in our previous experiences. So that is super exciting and, you know, we see that all of the work that we do there essentially is a force multiplier to that large content investment we are making.
If we do a better job there, that means every dollar that we spend means more value back to our members by connecting them with the titles that they are truly going to love. Advertising is another really great area. You know, we have seen it is a high hurdle to create a brand forward spot in a creative universe of one of the titles that we are currently carrying. But it is very compelling for both watch and for those brands, and we think these generative techniques can decrease that hurdle iteratively over time and enable us to do that in more and more spots.
So there is a bunch of places where we think we have got an advantage in terms of data and scale where we can leverage these new generative techniques to deliver just more benefits for our members and for our creative community.
Spencer Neumann:
Yeah.
Ted Sarandos:
If you do not mind me coming back for one second, I just rolled off iLine as if everyone knows what iLine is. I probably should clarify that iLine is our production innovation group inside of our VFX house at Scanline, and they are doing a lot of this work with our creators. So I just realized that I just threw that out there as everyone knew.
Spencer Wang:
Thanks for clarifying, Ted. Let us see. Our next question comes from Brian Pitts of BMO Capital Markets. With your evolving gaming ambitions, including partnerships with Grand Theft Auto and the recently announced Roblox agreement, can you talk to near-term monetization opportunities within gaming?
Greg Peters:
Sure. We look at the near-term monetization opportunity with games very similar to how we have looked at other new content categories can think unscripted or film or on and on. And that is essentially if we deliver more value in our offering, we get increased user acquisition, we get increased retention, we get increased willingness to pay. So it drives all of the sort of core fundamentals of our business. We have seen those positive effects, albeit in a small way relative to the size of our overall business. When it comes to members playing games on the service. We already have those positive proof points.
And we are going to ramp our investment in this area, which is currently quite small compared to our overall content investment. As we ramp the size of those positive effects. So we want to remain disciplined not investing too far ahead of demonstrating that we know how to translate that investment into value for our members. We have seen good progress, as you note, with licensed games like GTA. We have seen good progress with games we developed like Squid Game Unleashed, so you will see more from us in both of those categories. As well as a whole new set of interactive experiences that we think that we are either in a unique or differential position to deliver.
So we are super excited to roll those out over the next year. And then we remain open to the core question. We remain open to evolving our monetization model, but we have got to get to a lot more scale before that becomes a really materially relevant question. So we are going to do that work first. It is probably worth restating, the TAM for this market is very, very large. We remain convicted about our strategic opportunity and excited to make more progress.
Spencer Wang:
Thanks, Greg. We will take our last question. From Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America Securities. Given your healthy balance sheet and what appears to be a coming wave of M&A and media globally, are there certain types of assets that would strengthen your moat i.e., what is your view of owning successful IP or studio assets as they come to market?
Spencer Neumann:
I will take that one, Spencer. Thanks, Jessica. Well, we agree. Continued consolidation of studio and network assets is likely. But at least with respect to consolidation, within legacy media, we do not think it materially changes the competitive landscape. As you also know, we have historically been more builders than buyers, and we continue to see big runway for growth without fundamentally changing that playbook. You heard a lot of that today. So we look at a lot of things. We apply a framework or lens to those opportunities when we look at, you know, is it a big opportunity? Does it strengthen our entertainment offering? Does it strengthen our capabilities? Does it accelerate our strategy?
And we look at all of that relative to the opportunity cost of distraction or other alternatives. We have been pretty clear in the past that we also have no interest in owning legacy media networks so that also kind of reduces the funnel for us. But you know, in general, we believe we can and will be choosy. We have got a great business. We are predominantly focused on growing that organically, investing aggressively in responsibly into that growth. And returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase and you will see us continue on that path.
Spencer Wang:
Great. Thanks, Spence. And that will wrap up our Q2 earnings call. So we thank you all for taking the time to join us, and we look forward to seeing you all next quarter. Thank you.
Ted Sarandos:
Conditioning. Yeah. And much like France and France, they have three hot"

Full Conference Call Transcript
Gregory Peters:
Sure. We find it useful to talk internally about our long-term aspirations. Which, as we said at the time that this was reported last year, aren't the same as a forecast, but having said that, those goals were based on organic progress. They did not contemplate or assume any M&A because we didn't have any M&A on sort of our horizon at the time. And over the last nine months, we've seen continued growth. We are now forecasting more healthy growth for the year to come, organic growth. Of course, there's a lot of hard work ahead to fully realize those opportunities both short term and long term.
But based on the progress that we've made so far and expect to make, and our continuing assessment of the opportunity, we still feel good about those targets. Putting maybe a little bit more meat on that bone, in 2025, we met or exceeded all of our financial objectives. We made solid progress on our key priorities. We delivered 16% revenue growth, roughly 30% operating profit growth, expanding margins, growing key free cash flow, Ad sales, two and a half times in 2025. We expect that business to roughly double again in 2026 to about $3 billion. So we're making good progress, and the opportunity ahead of us is massive.
We are still under 10% of TV time in all major markets in which we compete, with hundreds of millions of households around the world still to sign up. We're just about 7% of the addressable market in terms of consumer and ad spend. So tons of room ahead of us. Anything you wanna add there?
Theodore Sarandos:
I would just say, you know, looking ahead to 2026, we're focused on improving the core business. You know? And we do that by increasing the variety and quality of our series and films, enhancing the product experience, and by growing and strengthening our ad business. We're also building out some newer initiatives, like our live outside of The US, things like the World Baseball Classic in Japan, that's launching in March. We're expanding into more content categories like video podcasts, which just kicked off this week. And we're continuing to scale our cloud-first game strategy. We're working really hard to close the acquisition of Warner Brothers Studios and HBO, which we see as a strategic accelerant.
And we're doing all this while we're driving and sustaining healthy growth. We forecast 2026 revenue at $51 billion, which is up 14% year on year. It's an exciting time. You know? This is an exciting time in the business. Lots of innovation, lots of competition. But that's also been true of us for twenty-five years. Netflix, Inc., we kind of embrace change and thrive on competition because it pushes us to keep improving the service even faster and faster for our members. You know, years ago, when we moved from DVD by mail into streaming, we were in a heated battle with Walmart for that DVD business. So we're no strangers to competition, and we're no strangers to change.
Through that change in competition, we've grown into an entertainment company that is thrilling an audience that is now approaching nearly 1 billion people. And producing series and films around the world with hits that resonate with audiences locally and globally.
Spencer Wong:
Thank you, Ted. So and just to circle back to Greg's point real quick, you know, we're very excited about the business. We're very excited about the organic opportunity ahead. See that in our performance, and we're as energized as ever to achieve our mission to entertain the world.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Ted. Our next question is about our outlook. It comes from Steve Cahall of Wells Fargo. The content amortization growth forecast of 10% in your earnings letter implies a bit of an acceleration from 2025. Can you provide some context as to where you're pushing for the most incremental investment, e.g., events, reality series, films, licensed content, etcetera?
Theodore Sarandos:
Yeah. Look. I think the cadence of our releasing is really strong. We have a really strong push out in the first half of this year already. With some great hits right out of the gate. So you wanna talk to that, Spence?
Spencer Neumann:
Yeah. I mean, I would say just generally, we've got a strong lineup throughout the year. But, yeah, Steve, as you noted, in 2025, our slate was heavily back half weighted, and we expect more typical seasonality this year. So still a bit heavier in the back half of '26 than the front half of '26. In particular, Q4, the fourth quarter is always generally the most packed for us in any given year, but overall, a smoother slate and smoother slate timing this year relative to '25. So as a result, you should see higher year-over-year content expense growth in '26 growing off of that smaller base that we had in the first half of last year.
But for the full year, we're estimating, as you I think you see in our letter, content amortization to increase roughly 10% year over year. Our content cash to expense ratio should hold pretty steady at about the 1.1x ratio that we've been managing to the last few years. So it's no change in our approach. We aim to grow content spend slower than revenue so that it can contribute to our margin expansion while strengthening and expanding that entertainment offering as you heard from Greg and Ted across not just our core film and series, but expanding into more content formats.
Theodore Sarandos:
Yeah. Let me tell you what that waiting looks like to the members too, what you just talked about, Spence. But, you know, in the first half of this year, we said we'd come out of the gate with some great hits. People we meet on vacation, the rip, his and hers, A New Year's Eve release of Stranger Things finale is still crushing. We've got Bridgerton season four that's coming up later this month and next month. So you see that we're really excited about the 2026 slate. Both H1 and H2.
We've already mentioned the Bridgerton return, but we also have a return of One Piece season two, third season of The Night Agent, second season of Beef, A Hundred Years of Solitude from Columbia back for a second season, got Avatar: Last Airbender. We've got Emmy, Golden Globe, and SAG actor nomination for Diplomat season four back again for a new season. Tires season three. And the series finale of Outer Banks. That's, like, the returning stuff. For new things, we're really excited about something very bad in the boroughs. Both new series from the Duffer Brothers Following Up Stranger Things.
Pride And Prejudice From The UK, Man on Fire, Can This Love Be Translated just launched from Korea, looks like it's gonna be another really nice hit for k-drama lovers. I mentioned some of our early films. We've got people we meet on vacation in the rip. We've got Affleck and Matt Damon that's already off to a great start. Still looking forward to Peaky Blinders, Immortal Man, from Killian Murphy. We've got Greta Gerwig's Narnia. We've got Apex with Charlize Theron. We've got Denzel Washington and Robert Pattinson in a great heist caper. Here comes the flood. And we've got a bunch of surprises upcoming too for '26.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Ted. Thanks, Spence. That's a good segue into our next question on the outlook from John Blackledge of TD Cowen. For your 2026 guidance, can you walk through the key drivers of the top line revenue range, which was above consensus at the midpoint? And for the operating margin guidance of 31.5%, can you talk about the puts and takes to that guidance, and any other color would be great.
Spencer Neumann:
Yeah. Sure, John. I'll take this one. We've got a strong growth outlook. As you heard from Greg and Ted, we feel great about the organic growth outlook. I hope you see that on our top and bottom line guide. On the revenue side, for 2026, key drivers are similar to '25. So it's membership growth, it's pricing, and it's a rough doubling of our ad revenue in 2026 to about $3 billion. So a bit more relative contribution from ads as we're scaling that business. So we feel great about that, and we feel great about our operating profit growth and margin growth too. We're targeting 31.5% operating margins for 2026. That's up two points.
So no change to our approach there. We set margin targets. So you think about the puts and takes. We're always balancing the investment into our core business to drive sustained revenue growth with spend discipline. And we aim to grow our margins each year. That rate of that year-over-year growth bounces around a bit based on investment opportunities and other considerations in a given year. If you look back over the last handful of years, we've expanded our operating margins about two percentage points annually on average. This guide at two percentage points, that actually includes about a half a percentage point drag from the expected M&A expenses that we referenced in the letter.
ADVERTISEMENT
So if you exclude that, we're guiding to about two and a half points of margin expansion. So very much in line with what we've been delivering. This year in particular, again, getting back to the puts and takes, we're seeing a number of attractive investment opportunities to strengthen and expand our entertainment offering and our product and commerce capabilities.
Theodore Sarandos:
So we are increasing our expense growth a bit this year. A bit higher pace of growth relative to last year to invest into those opportunities. All while continuing to expand our margins and deliver strong dollar profit growth. And don't know. Maybe, Greg, Ted, don't if you wanna talk a little bit more about our focus areas of investing in the content.
Gregory Peters:
I'll tell you a couple of things that we're excited about in this, you know, we're investing into them because our members are showing a lot of excitement for them. So we've got some new license deals in place with Sony. That includes the first of its kind global pay one movie deal. We've expanded our universal licensing deal for the kind of that already included some very successful animation films. To include live-action films. We have a new slate of licensed titles from Paramount which is gonna bring a lot of new series and television shows that Netflix, Inc. has never had around the world. Very exciting. In the live area, we've now executed more than 200 live events.
And we're expanding to do more now outside of The US. Including, World Baseball Classic in Japan, I mentioned that in March. And this Friday, have Skyscraper Live which is gonna be an edge of your seat TV experience for sure. So more to come there. And we just kicked off podcast this quarter, which has been exciting. We've launched new ones from Spotify and the Ringer. IHeartMedia, Barstool. We have a lot more to come, and some new originals. So these are all areas that have shown great promise. Members love them. We're excited to broaden the investment to include them. Greg, you wanna jump in there too?
Gregory Peters:
Yeah. I'd say on top of content, we got a number of other areas that we expect will drive meaningful growth and returns on the tech and dev side. We're continuing to build out that ad tech stack. We're evolving our mobile UI. We're adding two more live operation centers in '26. One is gonna be in UK and one in Asia to support the growth of our live efforts outside The US. In ads, beyond the tech side, we continue to invest in more sales, more go-to-market capabilities. That's a direct driver of advertising growth. On games, we are going to continue to invest in the cloud-first gaming strategy that we've added.
This makes TV games more accessible by rolling out cloud games to more customers in more countries. If you take all of that sort of stepping back within the margin expansion model that Spence described, which keeps us disciplined on returning to shareholders as we invest in new growth, We also think about investing across our portfolio based on capability to translate those investments into value for members and returns for the business. We've got a solid track record of doing that, and our core content categories, so we're gonna continue to grow there.
We're also increasingly about our ability to do that in ads and live where the 200 live events that Ted mentioned indicates that we should ramp and grow in those areas. And then for our other initiatives, those represent a small fraction of our overall investment, and we always remain very disciplined and measured in increasing those investments based on demonstrating that we can deliver member value, we can translate that investment into member value, and move the business forward.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Ted. Thanks, Spence, for that Folsom I'll move this along now to a few questions around engagement. The first comes from Rich Greenfield of Light Shed Partners. At this stage of Netflix, Inc.'s maturity, how directly tied is engagement to churn and pricing power as you started talking more openly about how all hours of engagement are not the same?
Gregory Peters:
So viewing hours, that's a really important in assessing the value that we deliver to customers. And value delivered is what drives the outcomes that you mentioned, Rich, and really, it drives most outcomes that we care about. But it's just one of many metrics that we look at. And we continue to develop an increasing understanding of how to measure that value delivered. So maybe start by just noting that total view hours in the '25 grew 2% year on year. That's billion and a half additional hours. Slight acceleration from the 1% growth we saw in the '25. But even with that number, there's some nuance underneath that.
Viewing of our branded originals was actually up 9% year over year in the second half. Versus 7% in the first half. That represents roughly half of our overall viewing. But viewing on the second run titles was lower year over year because the volume of licensed titles that we're carrying came down across most regions. And that's due largely to the fact that we stepped up our licensing in '23 and '24, during the strikes, which had shut down new productions, So that's balancing out that volume right now. But beyond view hours then, as you stated, all hours of engagement are not the same. And we really care about the quality of that engagement.
For example, we said in the letter, live programming is an example where any given hour of entertainment has the potential to deliver outsized value. That's certainly also the case when you have a huge fan of a particular series or a movie. We, as viewers, we feel this intuitively. Right? We feel that excitement, that difference, that value when we watch something that we've been anticipating and we just can't wait to watch. And as a business, you know, we've become increasingly sophisticated, evolving our measures of that quality of engagement that we are delivering. It's very hard to do this, but we're getting better and better at it.
And our primary quality metric we achieved in '25 an all-time high for the service. We set a high goal for that metric and Bella and our content team stepped up and achieved that goal. That means that we deliver more entertainment value for our members and that shows up in core metrics like acquisition, like retention, You know, and retention's among the best in the industry, and we just completed a quarter where churn improved year on year. Customer satisfaction is at an all-time high. We also saw strong member growth.
We really managed more and more towards that complete understanding of value delivered because it's really what translates best and directly to revenue growth, and it better captures the overall health of our business.
Theodore Sarandos:
Yeah. I would just add, Greg, if you don't mind, you know, do of course, we look at the view hours, Rich, but we also look at a myriad of other signals to assess how our members are engaging and how important are do they value that engagement. So, you know, members have different value for different types of programming. In the letter, we talked about the fandom for k-pop and for Stranger Things season five. How fandom is such a powerful engine for our business because it creates advocates for Netflix, Inc. Valuable even beyond the ten hours spent watching Stranger Things, or the hour thirty-nine spent watching k-pop demon hunters.
You know, so we're really super confident we're gonna continue to grow engagement, but more importantly, the value of that engagement as well. Because that's what allows us to sustain healthy revenue growth in the long term.

Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Ted. Our next question on engagement comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. The engagement report gives us a sense of aggregate engagement across all titles and all members. Arguably, it's an overly simplified lens with which to view the health of the business. But one that suggests to some that the WB acquisition reflects a need for Warner and HBO's IP to address stagnant engagement levels on Netflix, Inc. today. Why is that the wrong conclusion, and how do you see the underlying engagement trends, in the business? Very succinct bear case from Ben Swinburne. Over to, you know, Ted or Greg.
Gregory Peters:
Yeah. So I'll take this one. So, yeah, you're right, Ben, and as we sort of got to a little bit in the previous answer, total view hours by itself, it's an overly simplified view into engagement and engagement trends. Why is that? Because view hours is basically a very broad metric. It's influenced by a lot of things. It's You've got plan mix, tenure mix, geography, culture differences are a big factor. Just as one example, take consumers in Japan. They watch roughly half to two-thirds the amount of TV as American consumers.
So as you have more member growth in places like Japan, and there are a lot of places like that and frankly where we have more upside and more potential growth over the years to come. That skews the view hours per member. So we look at engagement at a portfolio level. View hours is one element of that, but we also look to those quality metrics that we were talking about. And as we said, you know, we see improving quality translates into core metrics like better retention and, you know, just to reiterate, our retention is among the best in the industry. Customer satisfaction is at an all-time high.
Those are more complete or maybe better said, those are outcome measures that we really, really focus on. So we have multiple tools. To keep improving those measures. And the value that we deliver. More and better production, back to pushing on the quality scores and how do we improve that. More licensing, more partnerships with local creative communities, with local broadcasters around the world. That improves local content market fit. We're very optimistic about organic growth prospects. As you see from our forecast, as well as maybe the aspirational goals that were referenced before, which don't include any M&A, we see huge opportunity to keep improving things there. But we also see Warner Bros.
With one hundred years of IP, an incredible library, great new shows and films. That's an accelerant to our strategy, and it's another mechanism to improve our offering for our members. So our job is to identify the best opportunities to improve that offering, both organic and through selected M&A, and always remain flexible and disciplined in pursuing those opportunities.
Spencer Wong:
Thank you, Greg. Since Ben brought up Warner Brothers, I'll shift us to a few questions on the Warner Brothers acquisition. First from Mike Morris of Guggenheim. Does your planned acquisition of WB impact your approach to pricing the near to intermediate term? Would you consider raising the price of the service during the regulatory review process?
Gregory Peters:
There is no impact or change to our approach in how we're running the business in that regard.
Spencer Wong:
Right. Next one comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners. What surprised you most from the Warner Brothers due diligence, Greg? You in particular sounded less enthusiastic about major M&A back at the Bloomberg Screen Time Conference in October. As you went through the due diligence process, what got you more excited about the acquisition?
Theodore Sarandos:
Greg, can I interrupt you for one second here? Please go ahead. I just wanna make it clear. That it was our default position going in that we were not buyers. We went into this with our eyes open and our minds open. And when we got into it, we both got very excited about this amazing opportunity. So Greg, you could share with what was exciting for us there.
Gregory Peters:
That's right. And thanks, Rich, for bringing this up again. Yeah. One more time. But to Ted's point, when we got into the hood, there were several things we saw that were just really exciting, and we saw were exciting additions to our current business. Take first the film studio. We already know that, you know, existing from existing film output deals that the theatrical model is a complement to the streaming model. So we've seen that before. And to be super clear on this point, we have often, in our history, debated building that theatrical business. But we were busy investing in other areas, and it never made our priority cut.
But now with Warner Bros, they bring a mature well-run theatrical business with amazing films and we're super excited about that addition. Then you've got the television studio. Also a healthy business. It also complements our own, expands our production capability, You got great producers, great developers, and we intend to continue to produce shows for third parties and being a leading supplier to the industry. And then you get to the streaming side of things, You've got HBO. It is an amazing brand. It says prestige TV better than almost anything. Customers know it. They love it. They know what it means. You know, when you have programming from HBO, you know what an HBO show means.
It's also very complementary to our existing service and business. So owning HBO will allow us to further evolve our plan structure, allows us to deliver more series, more film, more value to consumers, and we'll leverage our global footprint in our streaming expertise to make that an even better service for consumers. So big picture, we just saw tremendous opportunity very achievable opportunity as well in bringing these two businesses together.
Spencer Neumann:
You know, if it's okay to pile on a little bit, I'll just pile on to the trivia. So you know, I just maybe I'm the numbers guy. So to put some numbers against it, Rich, also, I just key from our perspective is that when you when you look at this combined company or when we look at the combined company on a pro forma basis, so pro forma post close, We estimate that roughly 85% of the revenues in that pro forma post close business that roughly 85% is from the core business we're in today. That's why we view this deal as primarily an accelerator to our core strategy. Strategy.
With this added benefit, a big added benefit of a complementary scaled world-class TV and film studio that we're excited to run and continue to build.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Spence. Rich Greenfield also has a follow-up question on the transaction. What gives you the confidence the deal will get approved during the regulatory process? Ted, do you wanna take that one?
Theodore Sarandos:
Yeah. Thanks, Rich. We've already made progress towards securing the necessary regulatory approvals. We submitted our HSR filing. We're working closely with WBD and the regulatory authorities, including the US Department of Justice and the European Commission. We're confident we're gonna be able to secure all the approvals. Because this deal is pro-consumer, It is pro-innovation. It's pro-worker. It is pro-creator, and it is pro-growth. You know, Warner Brothers, we just said earlier, it's got three core businesses that we don't currently have. So we're gonna need those teams. These folks have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those businesses. So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it.
In this transaction, this is gonna allow us to significantly expand our production capacity. In The US and to keep investing in original content over the long term. Which means more opportunities for creative talent and more jobs. This is really a vertical deal for us. It allows us to gain access to a hundred years of Warner Brothers deep content and IP for development. And distribution in more effective ways that will benefit consumers and the industry as a whole. HBO, as Greg just mentioned, is a very complimentary service to ours. And the TV market is extremely dynamic and very competitive. So the TV landscape, in fact, has never been more competitive than it is today.
There's never been more competition for creators. For consumer attention, for advertising and subscription dollars. The competitive lines around TV consumption are already blurring, you know, as a number of services put their content on both the linear channels and the streaming services at the same time. And the more platforms are making their way into the TV, in your living room. So TV is not what we grew up on. TV is now just about everything. Oscars and the NFL are on YouTube. Networks are simulcasting the Super Bowl. On linear TV and streaming. Amazon owns MGM. Apple's competing for Emmys and Oscars. And Instagram is coming next.
So, you know, YouTube is just surpassed BBC and monthly average audience according to Barb that publishes these figures in The UK. So YouTube is not just UGC and cat videos anymore. YouTube has full name films. New episodes of scripted and unscripted TV shows. They have NFL football games. They have the Oscars. The BBC is gonna be producing original content for YouTube soon. They are TV. So we all compete with them in every dimension. For talent, for ad dollars, for subscription dollars, for all forms of content.
So more broadly, you know, we compete for people's attention across an even wider set of options that include streaming, broadcast, cable, gaming, social media, big tech video platforms, Our deal strengthens the marketplace. And it ensures healthy competition that will benefit consumers and protect and create jobs. That's why we're confident in the approval, Rich.
Spencer Wong:
Thank you, Ted. We'll now go to a series of questions on the topic of content and content strategy. The next question comes from Ben Swinburne and Morgan Stanley. In light of the global Sony pay one agreement and the pending WB transaction, can you talk about your film strategy looking ahead? Are you leaning away from that original films and increasingly to licensing films after an exclusive theater run?
Theodore Sarandos:
Thanks, Ben. No. There's no change to that approach. Dan Lynn and his team are gonna continue to produce a slate of Netflix, Inc. original films, and we'll also continue to license films in every available window as well. You know, our members love movies. And taste and diverse are very broad. Appetites are huge. So we wanna have a broadest offering as possible.
Spencer Wong:
Great. Next question is from Vikram Kisabhavola of Baird. What were your observations from recent live events such as Jake Paul versus Anthony Joshua, and the NFL on Christmas Day? How should we expect your investment in live events to evolve from here?
Theodore Sarandos:
Well, Vikram, remember, this is still a relatively small portion of total view hours. So the big live events like the amazing fight you're just talking about and that six-round knockout, and our NFL Christmas Day games and this new halftime show. Really important and differentiated parts of the service. But, again, small in total view hours. These events typically have outsized positive impacts on the business, around conversation and acquisition, and we're also starting to see some benefits to retention as well. But I said, it's a small portion of the content spend. With two hundred billion hours of very small portion of the total view hours too.
We remain really excited about it, and that's why we're building out and strengthening that offer. With things like Star Search premiering globally tonight with live voting. And we're beginning to invest in more events outside of The US like I mentioned, the World Baseball Classic in Japan, for local markets.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Ted. Another question from Vikram Kasavabola. What types of podcasts do you think will be most effective on the platform? What are your initial observations from the launches, this past month?
Theodore Sarandos:
Well, it's still very, very early, but we're super pleased by the early results that we're seeing. You know, we think about video podcasts like a modern talk show. But instead of having a single brand defined show, you have hundreds of them. So it's a broad offering versus a single broad show or format. But it does generate a lot of very passionate engagement, lots of variety. Are looking forward, you know, to the types of things we're gonna add here. The things that our members already love. So sports, you've seen it. We can build on the success of our sports adjacent strategy. Comedy and entertainment, and, of course, true crime.
You may have heard we've got some true crime stuff on Netflix, Inc.
Spencer Wong:
Great. Last question on content strategy comes from Rich Greenfield of LightShed. This is our quarterly theatrical question. Why has your, why has your view on theatrical windowing changed?
Theodore Sarandos:
Well, Rich, I will point out here, I have in the past made observations about the theatrical business. We were not in the theatrical business when I made those observations. This deal closes, we will be in the theatrical business. And remember this, I've said it many times, this is a business and not a religion. So conditions change and insights change, and we have a culture that we reevaluate things when they do. So, you know, short list of examples there. The pivots we've made around advertising, around live, around sports, In theatrical, we debated many times over the years whether we should build a theatrical distribution engine or not.
And in a world of priority setting and constrained resources, it just didn't make the priority cut. So now when this deal closes, we will have the benefit of having a scaled world-class theatrical distribution business with more than $4 billion of global box office. And we're excited to maintain it and further strengthen that business. Warner Bros. Films are gonna be released in theaters with a forty-five-day window. Just like they are today. This is a new business for us and one that we're really excited about. I'm actually quite proud of our long track record of evolving the business, and I believe our results speak to that as well.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Ted. We'll now move on to a few questions we have from analysts about advertising. Steve Cahall from Wells Fargo asks, as you look at the ads potential in 2026, do you think you could reach parity on ARM, average revenue per membership, or ad-supported for ad-supported versus your ad-free plans?
Gregory Peters:
Yeah. So there is still a gap between the ad tier ARM for standard without ads, but that gap is narrowing. And while because there's a gap, it means we're under realizing revenue growth in the near time. It also, therefore, represents an opportunity for us. So as we improve our ad capabilities, we can close that gap over time. We can drive more revenue. We've seen exactly that ability to do that over the last year. We've expanded demand sources. We continue to prove our speed of execution on our own ad tech stack. That's more ad features, ads products, more measurement, etcetera. That means increased fill rates and that's driven ads ARM higher.
Now that we've grown to relevant scale, meaning consumer reach and all our ads countries, our main focus is on increasing the monetization of that growing and in inventory. It's likely to remain our focus for, you know, at least the next several years. So we believe we can close that gap and that means upside in terms of revenue growth.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Greg. As a follow-up from Ben Swinburne, as you head into your second year with your own ad tech, build out across the 12 ad markets. What's the opportunity to drive revenues? Can you maintain your premium CPE and so meaningfully increase bill rate in the year ahead to deliver another rough doubling of advertising revenue?
Gregory Peters:
Yeah. So as we mentioned a couple of times before, really the most immediate benefit we've seen from our rollout of our own stack has just been making it easier for advertisers to buy in our service, more places to buy. We hear that directly in terms of feedback from advertisers. We see it in the sales performance, of course. In 2026, we are making more Netflix, Inc. first-party data accessible, of course, in a privacy-safe, data-secure way. For assessing media investments. That ability to tap into this deep library of insights that we have ultimately enhances the performance of media buys.
We're also offering advertisers a wider array of ads formats so more ads products, enhanced interactivity, which should improve outcomes, At the end of last year, we started testing modular capabilities with interactive video ads. These ads cater to members' viewing behaviors and allows advertisers to benefit from essentially a dynamic template that uses mix and match creative elements to drive better business outcomes. We've seen good early results in the testing, and we'll roll those out globally by 2026. Additionally, now that we've been on our own ad stack for over six months, we've got a better set of data, historical campaign data, We can use that to enhance our RFP process.
Drive better media planning, better outcomes for our advertisers. So get to the point of question, we see all of that adding up to the same kind of performance we saw over the last year, which means we can grow revenue targeting doubling that revenue growth by improving fill rate and growing inventory with similar CPMs.
Spencer Wong:
Thanks, Greg. We also have a question on gaming, which I'm excited for since I'm a big player of our new party game, Boggle. If my family's watching, I'm still the number one winner. But this question comes from Vikram, Kesap Abhotla Baird. Netflix, Inc. had some key developments in its video game offering throughout 2025. How would you characterize your success and progress at this stage? What are your key priorities for this business in 2026?
Gregory Peters:
We've seen some really positive results with games like Red Dead Redemption, same kind of performance that we saw in GTA for folks that are familiar with that. We're also excited about more kids, more narrative feature releases in 2026. So those are good areas of growth for us. But a big advancement, as you sort of alluded Spencer, a big priority for us is our cloud-based TV games. It's an exciting launch for us. We're still in the early stages of this rollout of roughly a third of our members have access to TV-based games. This is sort of a process of upgrading the TV technology, the TV clients to be able to handle that.
And recently, with our party games on TV boggle, as you mentioned, Pictionary, LEGO party games like that, we've seen, you know, really strong uptake. So it's off a small base because about think about 10% reach into those eligible members. But our TV-based games have enjoyed quite a significant engagement uptick, after that party pack launch. And then in 2026, this year, we're gonna be expanding that cloud-first strategy. We've got a growing set of cloud games to the TV like our recently announced newly reimagined, more accessible FIFA football simulation game. We're super excited to be able to launch that. And stepping back for a second, if you look at that in totality, why is this important?
You know, as we said in the past, it's a big market, roughly $140 billion worth of consumer spend China. We are just scratching the surface today in terms of what we can do in this space. But we already are seeing multiple instances of how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement, with the service and with the story, but it also creates synergy that reinforces both mediums. So the interactive and the noninteractive side, that drives more engagement, more retention. So, you know, bottom line, we're very bullish on the opportunity side. We're seeing progress. Still got a lot of work to go do.
And I should say, like, all of our developing initiatives we're gonna ramp our investment based on demonstrated value to members and returns to the business.
Theodore Sarandos:
We will have Spencer give us a Boggle demo next quarter. I watched the video of Greg playing with Elizabeth, and there's no way I'm gonna challenge Greg because I think he'd take me down in two seconds. But with that, we'll take our last question from Rich Greenfield of Light Shed, on innovation. His question is, why isn't vertical video a higher priority for Netflix, Inc.?
Gregory Peters:
Rich, we've actually been testing vertical video features for some time, about six months or so. We've had a vertical video feed in the mobile experience that's been available for several months. So, that feed is filled with clips of Netflix, Inc. shows and movies. You can imagine us bringing more clips based on new content types like video podcasts, which Ted mentioned that we're adding to the general service. We'll bring the, you know, sort of appropriate components of that into that vertical video feed. And really, this is part of a broader upgrade of our mobile experience.
Just as you've seen us do with the new TV UI, we're working on a new mobile UI that will better serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come. We're gonna roll this out later in 2026. And just like our TV UI, it then becomes a starting point. It becomes a platform for us to continue to iterate, test, evolve, and improve our offerings. So don't worry, Rich. We got more vertical video coming for you.
Spencer Wong:
Thank you, Greg, Ted, and Spence. That is all the time we have now for our call. We thank all the listeners for tuning in to our earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you."

IBM
0.96%
)
delivered Q2 2025 results exceeding management’s expectations for revenue, profitability, and cash flow, driven by double-digit growth in both its software (up 8%) and infrastructure (up 11%) segments. The Gen AI book of business surpassed $7.5 billion inception-to-date, while the consulting segment stabilized with a growing backlog despite flat revenue in the first half of 2025, supported by healthy new client acquisition and higher Gen AI penetration. Management underscored its confidence in future growth by raising full-year free cash flow guidance to above $13.5 billion for 2025 and targeting run-rate productivity savings of $4.5 billion by year-end. Margin expansion across key profit lines was attributed to both portfolio mix and efficiency gains, with continued investment in AI-driven platforms, including the z17 mainframe and expanded Watson x offerings, highlighted as drivers of ongoing value creation.
Krishna cited “optimism around the macro environment,” with particular strength in Japan and South Asia, along with resilience in Europe, fueling enterprise technology demand growth in the 5%-7% range.
Kavanaugh stated, “We are taking up the year on our productivity initiatives … raising that to $4.5 billion. That flows to operating margin.”
IBM’s Red Hat OpenShift growth benefited from greater client demand for cross-cloud container and virtualization solutions, bolstered by reduced market competition and HashiCorp integration.
Krishna confirmed the impact of recent U.S. federal focus on “cost-cutting and efficiency” but expects near-term modernization projects to gain momentum, citing direct engagement at “highest levels in the various agencies.”
Net new business penetration was up 13% year over year, over 200 new clients were acquired in our consulting business year over year
Management reiterated its comfort with current consensus for Q3 2025 revenue and profitability, without issuing a formal upward revision.

Arvind Krishna:
Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we delivered solid results across revenue, profit, and cash, exceeding our expectations. Our performance this quarter was led by software and infrastructure, as demand remains high for technology that improves productivity, reduces costs, and fuels innovation. While the operating environment remains dynamic, these results reflect the strength of our portfolio and the resiliency of our business model. Before I get deeper into the results, let me touch on the broader economic backdrop. I'll start by saying that we appreciate the administration's priority on economic growth and focused regulation, which will strengthen the U.S. competitive position.
We believe this will result in long-term value creation and enable technology to contribute to economic growth. Technology continues to serve as a key competitive advantage, allowing businesses to scale, drive efficiencies, and fuel growth, and we saw this play out in the quarter. While not a major factor overall, geopolitical tensions are prompting a few clients to move cautiously. US federal spending was also somewhat constrained in the first half, but we do not expect it to create long-term headwinds. Let me now turn to our execution in the quarter. Our strategy remains focused: hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.
This strategy is built on five reinforcing elements: client trust, flexible and open platforms, sustained innovation, deep domain expertise, and a broad ecosystem. Together, they form a flywheel for growth, which again played out this quarter. In software, we continue to see momentum, including 14% growth in Red Hat. Ashi Karp is also off to a great start, accelerating performance in our first four quarters since closing, and seeing early wins with joint Ansible and Terraform product synergies. Infrastructure was up 11%, driven by a very strong start to z17. The new IBM z is an embodiment of the hybrid cloud and AI capabilities we bring to clients.
IBM z continues to deliver on its core strengths: AI, security, and scalable capacity, driving its enduring nature with clients. These results were balanced by consulting performance, which continues to be impacted by the demand environment. AI remains a powerful driver of transformation for our clients and for IBM. We are transforming our enterprise operations using technology and embedding AI across more than 70 workflows, leveraging our own IBM software solutions across hybrid cloud automation and AI to drive competitive advantage. What differentiates IBM is the breadth of our AI offerings, with an innovative technology stack and consulting business at scale, and our client zero lens.
Our Gen AI book of business now stands at over $7.5 billion, inception to date, with momentum accelerating quarter over quarter. We are seeing strong demand for our AI agents and assistants, REL AI, Granite Models, as well as an accelerating need for our consulting services to deploy AI. Just last week, IBM was recognized as an emerging leader in the first-ever Gartner emerging market quadrant for Gen AI consulting and implementation services. Our client zero experience has resonated with companies like UPS, Verizon, Mizuho, and Nestle, which are using our AI tools to unlock data, drive automation, and reduce operational friction.
As clients focus on scaling AI and delivering ROI, our progress on internal productivity is fueling and accelerating our client engagements. We're also expanding our partner ecosystem to deliver AI at scale. This quarter, we announced new or deepened collaborations with Oracle, Vox, AWS, Salesforce, Microsoft, Benastra, and WPP. Each is aimed at embedding Watson x into core business workflows. In 2025, we introduced new capabilities across our portfolio. We launched new features for Watson x Orchestra, which allows users to build custom AI agents in minutes with no coding required. There are now more than 150 prebuilt domain-specific agents in our catalog spanning HR, sales, procurement, and IT.
Our partners are building on this as well, integrating agents from Oracle, Salesforce, AWS, and others. Orchestrate supports the full agent lifecycle, from building to managing and governing agents across business functions, regardless of which AI models they are built with. We expanded Watson x.data to enable our enterprise clients to get easy access and drive value from their trusted, unstructured data. And our webMethods hybrid integration simplifies our clients' connect workflows, APIs, and data across hybrid environments. As agentic AI matures, we believe it will power over a billion new applications and a massive expansion in code, driving a critical need for automation. Our automation portfolio is uniquely positioned to deliver these solutions to clients across hybrid cloud.
SAP plans to deploy our high-value automation portfolio, including Red Hat Ansible automation platform, and HashiCorp Terraform and Vault, highlighting the opportunity we have in product synergies. Innovation also extends to infrastructure. This quarter, we launched z17, our most advanced mainframe yet. It features the new Telen two processor, delivering more than 450 billion AI inference operations per day with millisecond latency. That means AI models can run directly on transactional workloads with no external servers needed. The SPIRE accelerator, which will be available in the fourth quarter, will enable Watson x code assistant for z, and Watson x assistant for z to run natively on z17.
As more than 70% of IBM Z clients continue to expand or maintain capacity, our software stack is bringing even more innovation to IBM Z, including Watson x Code Assistant for z, Watson x Data, Concert, and HashiCorp Vault. In July, we introduced Power Eleven, to deliver the performance, resiliency, and scalability enterprises need to run mission-critical data-intensive workloads across hybrid environments. And we have announced Rise with SAP on Power Eleven. In quantum, we achieved a major milestone with the deployment of IBM Quantum System two in Japan in partnership with Raikin. This marks the first installation outside the United States and underscores our commitment to global leadership in quantum computing. To complement our organic innovation, M&A remains important.
We closed the acquisition of DataStax this quarter, adding real-time scalable data capabilities to support AI-driven applications. In closing, we remain focused on consistent execution and long-term growth. While the environment remains dynamic, we have a disciplined strategy and a durable business model. Given our first-half performance, we continue to expect accelerating revenue growth to 5% plus, and are raising our expectations for free cash flow to above $13.5 billion for the year. We are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth. Jim, over to you.
Jim Kavanaugh:
Thanks, Arvind. In the second quarter, we delivered $17 billion in revenue, $4.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA, $3.2 billion of operating pretax income, and operating earnings per share of $2.80. And through the first half, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow, our highest first-half free cash flow margin in many years. Our revenue growth mix and productivity drove 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, 16% adjusted EBITDA growth, and 15% operating earnings per share growth. We exceeded our expectations on revenue, profitability, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share, highlighting the strength of our portfolio and resiliency of our business model. Our revenue for the quarter grew over 5% at constant currency.
Software grew 8% this quarter, as we continue to benefit from our high-value annual recurring revenue base, which grew to $22.7 billion, up 10% since last year. Red Hat growth accelerated one point sequentially to 14%, fueled by another quarter of double-digit bookings and demand for our hybrid cloud solutions. We gained market share across each of our key solutions, led by OpenShift growing revenue more than 20% with ARR now at $1.7 billion. Automation grew 14%, with HashiCorp off to a strong start. We accelerated bookings growth in the first four quarters since closing, fueled by IBM's global go-to-market reach, and deepening product and technology synergies that are unlocking new customer value.
Data was up 7%, fueled by strength across our AI offerings. And transaction processing revenue declined 2% in the quarter, reflecting where we are at with our new z17 cycle as clients prioritize hardware spend at the beginning of a new program, as you can see in our strong IBM z results. Infrastructure revenue grew 11% this quarter, with hybrid infrastructure up 19% and infrastructure support down 3%. Within hybrid infrastructure, IBM z was up 67%, reflecting early strength in our z17 program as AI use cases are resonating strongly with clients.
The success of our launch highlights the enduring nature of the IBM z platform through the value of our continued innovation around AI workloads, and the realization that hybrid cloud is the dominant architecture. Clients continue to invest in IBM z because it remains the backbone for mission-critical workloads, offering unmatched reliability, scalability, security, and performance, while seamlessly integrating with hybrid cloud and AI strategies. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 17% with product cycle dynamics impacting power. With the recent announcement of Power Eleven in July, Power Eleven, our next-generation platform, features advancements across the processor, hardware architecture, and virtualization software stack.
While storage was impacted by the new IBM z cycle, as clients prioritize hardware spend, our early strength in z17 and the growth in the installed MIPS capacity drives a long-term benefit given the three to four x z stack multiple. Consulting revenue was flat, stabilizing in the first half, and heading into the second half, our backlog remains healthy, up 4% over last year, despite the challenging pricing environment. In the quarter, intelligent operations revenue grew 2%, while strategy and technology declined by 2%.
The environment remains dynamic, with clients prioritizing cost-efficient high-impact technology investments, driving good revenue growth in areas like business application transformation, AI operations, and cloud platform engineering, and leading to momentum in our consulting generative AI book of business at over $1 billion in the quarter. This early momentum is important. Engaging with clients as they architect their AI strategies is establishing consulting as the strategic partner of choice. And we are encouraged that through the first half, we are seeing a greater share of Gen AI signings tied to new projects. Delayed decision-making, especially in discretionary projects, as well as prior-year renewals, impacted our end-period signings.
However, we're seeing an improvement in strategic wins with new clients and expanding engagements with existing clients. Now turning to profitability. During the quarter, the strength of our portfolio mix and productivity execution drove expansion of our operating gross profit margin of 230 basis points, adjusted EBITDA margin of 200 basis points, and operating pretax margin of 110 basis points, ahead of our expectations and well above our model. Our productivity initiatives create a flywheel that allows us to invest back in our business, both organically and inorganically, increase our financial flexibility, and deliver margin expansion, as we saw this play out again in the quarter.
We remain laser-focused on driving efficiency and cost savings by leveraging technology and embedding AI in our workflows, as well as optimizing our supply chain and service delivery. This quarter, we continue to optimize our supply chain by shifting our distributed infrastructure manufacturing to an industry-standard strategic partner. This is the next evolution of our supply chain transformation, as we pivot to a simpler, more efficient process, which helps us optimize cash conversion cycles. Through the first half, we generated $4.8 billion of free cash flow, up about $300 million year over year, resulting in our highest first-half free cash flow margin in reported history.
The largest driver of this growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up $1 billion year over year. Partially offsetting this is working capital. Given global trade dynamics, we continue to prudently protect our supply chain, reflecting the confidence we have in our new innovation cycles across infrastructure. And as we have been discussing, given the closing of HashiCorp acquisition, foregone interest income was another headwind. Despite this, we are a few points ahead of our historical attainment levels through the first half. Our strong liquidity position, solid investment-grade balance sheet, and disciplined capital allocation policy remain a focus for us.
We ended the quarter with cash of $15.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the end of 2024, including spending $7.8 billion on acquisitions in the first half, driven largely by the closing of HashiCorp. Our debt balance ending the quarter was $64.2 billion, including $11.7 billion of debt for our financing business, with the receivables portfolio that is over 75% investment grade. In addition, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first half. Now let me talk about what we are seeing going forward. We delivered strong performance in the first half across revenue, operating margin expansion, profitability, and earnings per share and free cash flow.
The strength of our portfolio, investment in innovation, and integrated value drive the durability of our revenue performance and underpin our confidence in accelerating revenue growth of 5% plus for the full year. And through the first half, given the strength in our underlying fundamentals with our adjusted EBITDA up 14%, we are raising our free cash flow guidance to above $13.5 billion for 2025. As discussed at our investor day, our mix shift towards software is a key driver of our growth acceleration. Software is now about 45% of our business, with ARR growing 10%.
Given the strength of our portfolio, investment in innovation, and contribution from acquisitions, we continue to expect software revenue growth approaching double digits for the full year. Through the first half, we delivered above-model growth of 15% in automation, and in-line model growth of 14% in Red Hat, and 7% in data, and these trends should continue. And we continue to expect Red Hat to grow in the mid-teens. While transaction processing was flat in the first half and below our model as clients prioritize spend on our high-value innovation z17, the strength of the new cycle provides future modernization value across the z stack. Given this dynamic, we now expect low single-digit growth in transaction processing for the year.
With our strong start to z17, infrastructure should contribute about 1.5 points to IBM's revenue growth this year. And in consulting, while we are encouraged by our backlog growing mid-single digits and the continued progress in our Gen AI book of business, given the current demand environment, we continue to be prudently cautious on consulting's growth contribution to IBM this year. As I mentioned earlier, we have been accelerating our productivity initiatives, which is fueling our flywheel for growth and margin expansion. We are early in this client zero journey, on scaling AI internally to reinvent the way we work and are excited about the significant opportunities ahead of us.
We exited 2024 at $3.5 billion of annual run rate savings achieved, and we now believe we can achieve approximately $4.5 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2025. Through the first half of the year, our operating pretax margins have expanded by 90 basis points, ahead of our model. Despite dilution from HashiCorp. Given this performance and increased productivity savings, we are raising our expectations for IBM's full-year operating pretax margin to expand by about a point. And our tax rate expectation for the year remains in the mid-teens. As always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year.
For the third quarter, we are comfortable with consensus estimates for revenue and profitability. Let me conclude by saying we are pleased with our first-half performance, highlighting the resiliency of our model, disciplined strategy, and growth opportunities ahead of us. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.
Olympia McNerney:
Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. And at this time, we'll begin the question and answer session of the conference. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. And our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.
Wamsi Mohan:
Yes. Thank you so much. I was hoping you could double-click on the software transit. It looks like organic growth decelerated in the quarter to maybe between 3% to 4%. Could you confirm that? And that would imply that it would be the third quarter of software organic growth deceleration. You just expressed confidence in your approaching 10% guide. So between transaction processing deceleration, maybe Red Hat maintaining it, what are some of the other puts and takes that we should be expecting in the business? And how much should we expect organic software growth to be for the remainder of the year? Thank you so much.
Jim Kavanaugh:
Okay, Wamsi. Thank you for the question. Appreciate it. Let's get right to the heart of this. You know, you dialed back to how we opened up the year in January, and then we built on that at our Investor Day in early February. We talked about 2025, we were entering from a position of strength in software. Why? New innovation we're bringing to market, strong recurring revenue base. By the way, now $23 billion grown double digits. Red Hat momentum throughout the year and the opportunity around virtualization and others, Gen AI book of business, and the M&A growth synergies. Halfway through the year right now, we actually feel even more confident about the year of approaching double digits.
And let me just break this down compared to the investor day model around each of our categories. One, hybrid cloud. We accelerated our Red Hat performance first quarter, second quarter by an incremental point, now growing about 14.5%. By the way, that's contributed about 3.5 points of IBM's software revenue growth, all organic, by the way. And we continue to see mid-teens growth for the year and contributing about 3.5 points. Why? Double-digit growth again in annualized bookings, opportunities around virtualization, by the way, through the first three quarters, we now eclipsed $300 million worth of total bookings around virtualization, and we see that pipeline even accelerating faster in the second half.
And then you got AI and application hybrid cloud containerization that's gonna drive it. So we feel pretty good about Red Hat. Two, automation. Our model and automation is low double digits. We operated through the first half at 15% above model. Now underneath that, we're contributing about 3.5 points of that software growth. We're off to a great start in HashiCorp as we talked about in the prepared remarks. We're very excited about the integrated value of that value proposition across IBM, plus Red Hat plus HashiCorp. We 2x-ed the annual bookings in the first quarter underneath IBM.
And, oh, by the way, our pipeline in the second half is 3x last year across our entire automation portfolio with regards to HashiCorp. So we actually expect automation to continue to accelerate throughout the year, and we will be well above our model mid to high teens against that investor day model. That's gonna contribute about an incremental point of growth. Third, data. Data, we continue to execute well on Gen AI momentum. Now inception to date, $1.5 billion worth of book of business on software. We're bringing new innovation to market, that we showcased at Think.
We're building strong pipeline in the second half that we're confident on, and we have the M&A synergies that are gonna play forward, both in automation and in data. So we expect that to deliver our model. Now you come to transaction processing. Transaction processing flat to the first step. That's, by the way, below our model, mid-single digit. Right? That's about a two-point impact to the first half to software's growth. When you look at it, well, what are we seeing? As we always talk about, transaction processing runs mission-critical software on top of our mainframe platform. We run that mainframe platform as a stack economic plate. Three to four dollars a platform multiplier over the cycle.
We're off to the strongest ever first-quarter start in the history of IBM around mainframe in a launch quarter. We shipped over 100% MIPS capacity into the marketplace on z17. So while that's having a near-term impact on transaction processing, you saw it down 2% in the quarter. Clients reprioritized their spend to the hardware. Now that will impact near term, but look at what happened on z16. Same thing happened in the second quarter last year. And what happened? We accelerated that growth. That's that multiplier effect as we get more capacity in the marketplace. And we expect transaction processing now to be about low single digit. It'll return to growth in the second half.
So between accelerating growth continued on Red Hat, the automation synergistic value on Hashi, transaction processing capitalizing on that multiplier effect of a very strong start on mainframe, we see that organic growth moving forward. And, oh, by the way, we're comfortable with third-quarter guidance, and third-quarter guidance already accelerates organic growth. Great. Operator, let's take the next question.
Operator:
Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.
Amit Daryanani:
Yep. Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone. Arvind, I'm hoping you just spend a little bit of time talking about, you know, what are you hearing from your customers at this point given what seems to be a very volatile macro tape? And maybe just talk about a few categories where you think customers want to spend more money they're prioritizing versus things that they might be deemphasizing a bit. And then very specifically, I'd love to hear your thoughts around Red Hat. Given the strong trajectory you guys are seeing, how do you see virtualizations starting to contribute to that growth, especially given the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom and the price increase in implementing sales? Touch on those.
Arvind Krishna:
Amit, very, very I've turned from being I used the word cautious optimism at the end of the first quarter I would now turn my way all the way to optimism around the macro environment. As we go around the globe, I'll first touch on geography and then touch on some sector or client examples. I think Japan is reindustrializing and they are committed to economic growth for their nation. That implies that Japan is digitizing at rates we have not seen and digitizing is through the use of technology. If you go across South Asia, they're all booming.
In real terms, South Asia is growing at north of 10% because when you think about 6-7% GDP growth in India combined with 6% inflation, that means that actual rates, their economies are growing at 10-12%. The Middle East, especially Saudi and UAE, they are booming in terms of plowing all of their profits back into their economies and they're trying to create now diversified economies of which technology forms a strong piece. People have talked a lot about Europe. But Europe has remained remarkably resilient as a technology consumer.
I believe the reason for that is that when they look at the concerns around supply chains, they look at the issues around cyber, and they look at their labor demographics, technology offers them an actual answer against all of those headwinds. We come into North America, and every company is now convinced that technology forms the basis of how do you scale revenue while not spending that much on capex and that much on labor expenses. So as you've gone around the globe, those form the backdrops for why enterprise technology is going to remain a strong grower somewhere in the 5-7% range is from what we can see.
Then if I touch on it in a more client lens, I think about a bank in Western Europe, they're strongly motivated to begin to use AI on how to improve their customer experience and how to improve their internal risk profiles. If I look at telecom, here in the United States, they're looking deeply at how they can have a software-defined backbone for their very high throughput network backbones in order to give themselves more flexibility in how traffic gets routed and to be able to leverage the rate of advancement that comes in standard servers and software.
Amit Daryanani:
It
Arvind Krishna:
ask me about Red Hat. So, Amit, if you'd allow me, I'll go a little bit broader than the virtualization question. First, Red Hat Linux. The core original product of Red Hat, is growing in the high single digits. Because of extreme demand around people deploying Red Hat in order to be able to leverage AI as well not just the standard server footprint which normally I would tell you gives you 6-7%, but additional workloads is adding that couple of percent that you're asking about. If we look at OpenShift, it's actually a platform answer. So people are looking for what platform do we use for containers, and what platform do we use
Amit Daryanani:
virtualization.
Arvind Krishna:
There were three or four answers in each category. If I look at two of the three competitors on the containerization side, they've taken themselves out of the market in practical terms. So if people are wanting a container platform that goes across public clouds and on-premise, I would tell you that we are the leading answer for that. And every analyst as an industry analyst will tell you that. If you look at virtualization, there are a few answers. But then there is a set of clients who would prefer a common answer across containerized virtualization. And then by default, we tend to win those. That has accelerated the OpenShift piece.
And last but not least, as we have brought HashiCorp in, and the numbers show through in the HashiCorp product family, but the combination with Ansible is very powerful and is going to boost Ansible as well going forward. So I hope this gives you a bit of color both on the macro and on Red Hat.
Olympia McNerney:
Operator, let's take the next question.
Operator:
Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question.
Ben Reitzes:
Hey, guys. Thanks. I wanted to take kind of like the opposite tack of the first question and ask why not, you know, what is causing you not to raise guidance if you feel better about the economy and it looks like free cash flow is above your pace. It looks like you're already at 5% plus constant currency. I know that includes an acquisition. And it looks like TPP and a bunch of others are may accelerate. So just wondering, you know, is it conservative to say that you're comfortable with the Street for the three q, when all that is looking actually better and you're already at your 5% plus and already ahead of pace on free cash flow, Thanks a lot.
Jim Kavanaugh:
Thanks, Ben. I appreciate the question overall. Let's just ground us in what we're actually saying both in the prepared remarks and here tonight. You know, coming off of a first half, which we feel very good and pleased about our performance. And I think it talks to how we have fundamentally changed and repositioned this company. Around a portfolio, a business model, and an execution engine that actually reflects itself in a diversified business model and a durable and resilient business model. So today, number one, we beat street expectations and our own expectations in the quarter. On revenue, on operating margin, on profitability, on earnings. On free cash flow.
And what are we saying about the full year here now tonight? Number one, since January, the average analyst estimates have taken up the IBM revenue by well in excess of a billion dollars. We've been taking up the year already. We live in an actual world. Yes. FX is moving our way. But also in the quarter, our $400 million beat about $375 million of that was pure business performance in constant currency. So by definition, we have confidence entering the second quarter, and I'll come back to revenue. But we're also then number two
We are taking up the year on our productivity initiatives. We exited last year. We talked about $3.5 billion of productivity. That we've been able to fundamentally drive out of this business. This is what Arvind keeps talking about, this productivity mindset. That we spent time with all of you at our think conference. About reimagining and reinventing how we run our company. How do we leverage technology, digitization, embed AI across our workflows? We are seeing extreme penetration around that, and that's given us guidance and confidence to raise that to $4.5 billion. That flows to operating margin. We're taking our operating margins up from a half a point to now roughly a point.
We're taking our adjusted EBITDA up because it's all high-quality earnings profit. That adjusted EBITDA is now going to be low teens growth. By the way, dollarize that, that's over $2 billion year-to-year growth in adjusted EBITDA. And then we're flowing that all the way down through the cash flow. High quality, sustainable cash flow generation. Now with all that said, we got a half a year to go. Free cash flow, we got two-thirds of our free cash flow to go. Revenue, we still got, you know, $40 billion worth of revenue to go.
We feel confident about the position we're in, the strength of our portfolio on software, double-digit annuity revenue, around $23 billion book of business, we feel good about infrastructure in the star and by the way, we took infrastructure up for the year. This is not a pull ahead. A mainframe cyclical demand in that quarter. We took the entire year up. So I would tell you, we feel very confident even more confident than 90 days ago. And, yes, we have upside and conservativism? Absolutely. But that's what you would expect of us.
Olympia McNerney:
Operator, let's take the next question.
Operator:
Your next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please state your question.
Jim Schneider:
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you step back and look at the holistic software portfolio, there were a lot of questions on what we're doing for this year. But maybe going forward heading into 2026, given the impact of some of the businesses and positive head tailwinds you talked about, do you think there's potential for improving both organic and overall software growth heading into 2026 from the current 10% levels? This year. I mean, I wonder if you think that's possible.
And then maybe secondarily, if you could just address the consulting business and, you know, what you're seeing right now in terms of the duration of the bookings you're seeing and whether there's any kind of, you know, change in the time to commencement of some of the consulting contracts you're signing. Thank you.
Arvind Krishna:
Jim, thanks for the question. Though I did, I think, count three parts in there. Let me address the first part. On the software macro going into 2026. And then I'll give it over to our Jim, Jim Kavanaugh, for some of the details there and on consulting. Look. I think the question you're asking is one that we spend a lot of time on and one that I'm incredibly confident about. If I look at the underlying macros, all the parts we talked about, Red Hat, I see them maintaining themselves into 2026. This is not unique to this quarter or a month. And so I would expect to see that same growth carry on there.
I look at automation, that is really driven by the complexity of our clients' technology environment, and then them wanting to run them at extremely high resilience. They want to run them at much lower labor cost expense. And the amount of compute in their environments is increasing, so they need technology we label their automation to go run all that. We can see that the desire to unlock value from all of the data to unlock data for AI, as well as to deploy AI inside the enterprise, which is where we are focused, is going to only accelerate not decrease.
So all those three parts of the portfolio I would give you equal or higher growth rates going into 2026. Now you come to TP. And Jim addressed that. TP tends to be slightly lagging with the capacity that is being deployed on mainframes. So as that capacity gets deployed, I would fully expect TP to return to its long-term model which is in between low and mid-single digits. So if you put all that together, and then if you add what other M&A we might do, because since you raised that, let me just you toss organic and inorganic. I'm very optimistic about the current M&A environment.
Of course, all regulators will always watch for misbehavior and for areas where they see too much consolidation. That said, what we've seen over the last four months has made us optimistic that we're now in a rational regulation environment where M&A that makes sense will get approved in reasonable time frames. So with that, Jim, let me give it to you.
Jim Kavanaugh:
Yeah. Jim, thank you for the question overall. Just let me put a bow on Arvind's point about software and bring it up a level to IBM, and then that will lead right into your consulting question if I remember the question overall. But when you look at it, first of all, way too early. We have a lot of work to do. Team is extremely focused on discipline, execution here in delivering and unlocking client value with all the new investments and innovation in the second half this year. When you look at 2026, and a big picture, I'll reiterate what we said in investor day.
We feel good about the software portfolio, and Arvind just gave you some of the key KPIs underneath that about how we feel even more confident heading into 2026 with that. But the other big drivers are, one, Gen AI. Not only software, but we've now got a north of $7.5 billion book of business, and it's generating increased penetration across our portfolio both software and consulting, which I'll talk on. Two, our M&A growth synergies. Know, we accelerated some opportunistically into this year.
We're very excited about the portfolio that we've been able to acquire and the synergistic value of what that gonna bring to automation to Wamsi's question, that is gonna fuel second half, and that's why second half pipeline is so strong in automation and data around that synergistic value of IBM, Red Hat, and Hashi together. So that synergistic play of M&A is gonna play out in 2026. Three, the integrated value of that multiplier effect of having a mainframe platform. We have taken up the year on infra, on mainframe. We see a very strong start and that three to four dollar platform multiplier plays out in 2026 and 2027.
And then finally, consulting backlog. $32 billion, which leads me to your last question. And let me take a little bit of a moment to talk about this because there's been a lot of competitors that have come out already in the marketplace. In our consulting overall, revenue was flat. We stabilized coming off of fourth quarter down one. I would tell you we're still operating as we said in prepared remarks. In a very dynamic environment. Clients are reprioritizing that spending. They're focused on cost efficiency and deploying Gen AI.
To really drive not only the operating leverage in our own business, but to Arvind's point, leveraging for what it's done for a century, and that is create scale and create new businesses and new markets and opportunities, and we're capitalizing on that. But even with that dynamic environment, I might surprise you right now, but we're actually seeing some good green shoots. One, I would put it in four buckets. Backlog, two, Gen AI, three, our strategic partnerships, and four, the fundamentals of our business. Redap productivity. Backlog, $32 billion. At spot rates, which is what's gonna play out over the history of that backlog, up over 8%.
Stable erosion, and, Jim, to your question, our duration's actually down six months from last year. So we're seeing much more higher revenue realization, higher quality overall, and our trailing twelve-month to bill is 1.14. Now our signings in the quarter before someone else asked the question we were down 18%. That was entirely driven by last year's large early renewals. As we've talked about over the years, I've been very clear all signings are not the same. Renewals by definition are low to no revenue realization, they're typically revenue and margin compression. And that's what's playing out here in the first half. Underneath that, though, our net new business penetration was up 13% year to year.
And in the first half, up seven points. Read that 200 plus new clients we acquired already in our consulting business year over year. And that's fueling actually an accelerated backlog in the second half. On what that backlog runout looks like in the second half. But, again, as you all know, that's only about 70% of the revenue in the second half. We still have to sell and bill new business starting in July through the rest of the year, but encouraging green shoots. Gen AI, $6 billion plus. By the way, 17% of our backlog now growing substantially. Over 20% of our bookings. And for the first time in the second quarter, we eclipsed 10% of our revenue.
Now coming out of Gen AI, at, by the way, over a three-point margin differential. Strategic partnerships, great momentum in SAP, Microsoft, AWS, Palo Alto, by the way, we have a lot of headroom. And productivity and business model, our margins are up over 200 basis points to the first half. So while a lot of green shoots, I think the Ben's question were prudently cautious in this environment. And by the way, if those green shoots play out, in the second half, it's upside to our guide.
Olympia McNerney:
Great. Operator, let's take the next question.
Operator:
Your next question comes from Eric Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Eric Woodring:
Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. You know, Arvind, I wanted to direct this to you. It kind of builds off of what Jim was just talking about. You know, it's been, I think, only six quarters. You've reached a $7.5 billion cumulative AI book of business. Incredibly impressive in such a short period of time. And I'm just wondering if you could provide us with some color on how that's impacting customer spend in the non-AI parts of IBM. And really what I'm trying to understand is how are customers prioritizing AI over non-AI? Is there cannibalization in other areas of client spend or is it incremental to client spend? And how might that change as you look at these engagements out over the next, call it, one to three years? Does it become more incremental? Just would love some flavor on incrementalism versus cannibalization. Thank you.
Arvind Krishna:
Thanks, Eric, for the question.
I'm going to sort of maybe dive down to the components of what is called a full AI stack to answer your question. So let's look at it across hardware, which includes semiconductors, then look at it in the enabling software layers, and software applications which actually leverage AI to make them themselves much better. And then finally into consulting. So if you look at it first from the semiconductors and the infrastructure level, I would tell you that this is completely incremental. And you can see that in the market when you look at CPU versus GPU, the CPU rates maintain. Yes. Who they are provided by changes all the time.
But the total volume of service is not decreasing. So that tells you that is maintained. What could happen or I would put that in the very tiny percentages or maybe 1-3%, is that people will put a little bit more pricing pressure on the item they believe to be commodity versus the item they believe to be high innovation. But that is just the way technology has always played out. That is where you're seeing it and you can see that reflected in the market right now. Next, when you get to the enabling software layers, that is purely incremental. There is no cannibalization there with alternate forms of technology.
I will tell you that the cannibalization is gonna come from the fourth part. People are looking at their own internal labor expenses and people are looking at their third-party labor expenses, and they're looking to decrease those to make room for what they're doing around software. When you look at AI coming into software products, whether it's ours, for example, in our case, in Aptio, in Hashi, in Turbanomic, so the known direct AI products, it actually makes those products better and compete better against others. So it's not a cannibalization because that would apply to ourselves. That is more a market share question. It takes market share from those who are unable to do that.
And you can also see that play out in the market with other players. If I look at consulting, yes, there is a big piece of the AI book of business, which is coming, because people are directing their dollars towards that kind of consulting as opposed to alternate forms of consulting. And that is why it's really important to be focused on what we call transformative projects, which includes AI, but also includes some of our partners, be it the cloud partners, or SAP or Oracle or Palo Alto, etcetera.
Because that kind of project is far more robust and less likely to be cannibalized but some other parts of customer application development do tend to get cannibalized towards AI. So hopefully, that gives you some color on both parts of your question. Why where our clients prioritizing and also where it's incremental.
Ben Reitzes:
Right.
Olympia McNerney:
Operator, let's take the next question.
Operator:
Your next question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please state your question.
Brian Essex:
Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Arvind, for you, appreciate your public sector-related comments at the beginning of the call, and it seems like we're starting to see a more aggressive competitive stance regarding, you know, IT investment from the current administration. Guess based on conversations you may have had, could you frame out how you think IBM is positioned to address the shift in spending priorities of leaving for public sector in general? And how much visibility do you have there? Thank you.
Arvind Krishna:
Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Look, I'll use the word federal as opposed to public sector because just because it's some of our written documents public includes health care and life sciences and others. So I'll use the word federal and government to be more precise in what this is. From my conversations, direct, as well as public statements from various members of the administration. That are very strong focus in the first six months to focus on cost-cutting and efficiency to get to what they believed was the right size. They have been very, very clear. Their focus is now shifting to number one, we need to modernize the agencies and how they leverage technology to provide a better service to citizens and to leverage technology to also reduce waste as opposed to just cost-cutting.
Two, I was very pleased to see the AI action plan that came out this morning. They are very clear that AI has to be used by government agencies against the goals I just laid out. Then while these have not concluded, the conversations we've been having with a number of agencies on leveraging our capabilities across both software as well as consulting. To help them go on their paths towards modernization, towards better services for citizens, towards reducing waste, towards more effective overall systems, kind of coming all the way into the 21st century. I'm actually quite enthused by their ability to begin to make progress in the next few months. So that's kind of what we're observing.
And so the visibility, I would tell you, highest levels in the various agencies, when they are willing to make time and they're willing to meet at the that's a positive statement that they are serious about it. And they do take us. And the visibility I get then is that I think we are a credible player because of our track record and having delivered for the government in the past many years.
Olympia McNerney:
Operator, let's take one last question.
Operator:
Thank you. And our last question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC. Please state your question.
Matt Swanson:
Alright. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question.
Arvind Krishna:
Arbell, I want to double-click, I think, on the $1.5 billion of software bookings in the Gen AI space. And specifically on some of these Watson x products, the data, the governance, and Orchestrate. So I guess one would be are you starting to see any of these really differentiate themselves in terms of customer demand? And then specifically on the orchestrate layer, that seems to be a space that a lot of companies have started to talk about. Whether it be model orchestration or GenTech orchestration. If you can just talk a little more about your right to win in that space and how you're positioned.
Arvind Krishna:
Matt, thanks for the question. First, I have been really pleased by both the uptake and the overall adoption of our Gen AI products.
Eric Woodring:
We put most of them under the Watson x umbrella.
Arvind Krishna:
So that's kinda where they show up in our internals. First, there's a few that you did not mention that I think are very unique to us both because of the knowledge we have as well as the capabilities that our engineers bring to the table. The Watson x code assistant on z, which helps people modernize their mainframe environment helps you understand and if you want translate your Cobalt code into Java, is really taken off and has got very wide adoption.
We thought people would use it to just modernize Kubernetes Java, but actually in the vast majority of the cases, people are also using it to understand the tens of millions of lines of code that they have and then decide what makes sense to modernize versus what makes sense to keep now that you can document it and know what it does. The second one that is very exciting that we're bringing out in this third quarter is a Watson x assistant for Zee. Which helps you have an AI administrator that manages your mainframe environment in addition to the people you have who manage it. So these are, I think, somewhat unique to us.
If I think about Watson x AI, people need an AI on time. Whether that's gonna come from Rel AI, or Watson x AI, as a place that they can get the models. And we are very focused on domain-specific smaller models as opposed to the very, very large models.
And that becomes a carrier for those. I think you're gonna see a lot more of those under the Rel AI and OpenShift AI umbrella. Because that is where some of those capabilities are going to migrate. People need to get their data ready for AI. So that's where what's the next data plays. And we believe with the upcoming integration of the DataStax capabilities into that, that will then become an even stronger offering. The last part of your question, and not to avoid your asking, what gives us the right to win and orchestrate? Look. IBM has always been about being in a heterogeneous space.
So it cannot be about just our own agents of which we have about 70 to 80 of them. It cannot be about the spoke agents only, because we believe many of our clients are gonna build bespoke agents that are unique to them. We also integrate in about 70 agents from third parties that come in there. This is gonna be one based on how easy is it. If it is only about your own agent, I actually think that those are our partners. Those are not people we compete with. And plenty are going to focus primarily on their own agents. Great.
Then there are going to be agents that come from different places and people want their own bespoke agents. That is the client we are going to win and orchestrate and that is what our pipeline and our early discussions with clients show. And that is what distinguishes us from those who are kind of focused on primarily their own agents. So look. To close the call out, we're off to a great start in the first half. Our portfolio strength, the resilience of our business model, reinforces our confidence in our growth trajectory. I look forward to sharing our progress with you, as you move through the rest of the year.
Olympia McNerney:

)
formally raised NII guidance to approximately $95.5 billion for 2025, attributing the increase to strong deposit growth in payments and security services, as well as balanced card growth, as discussed in the updated NII ex Markets guidance. CFO Barnum signaled increased resource deployment, noting that late-quarter RWA expansion resulted in a sequential CET1 ratio decline despite elevated earnings. Executives affirmed that all capital deployment options, including inorganic opportunities, remain under consideration, while underscoring a preference for organic reinvestment across high-return franchise businesses. CEO Dimon stressed that regulatory reforms such as potential adjustments to the G-SIB framework and SLR remain critical policy watch points, but do not currently constrain JPMorgan Chase's strategic flexibility. The firm highlighted broad-based revenue drivers, including strong performance in Markets, resilient consumer credit, and robust client deposit growth, while noting sustained fee strength across CIB and AWM segments.
CFO Barnum clarified that the rise in consumer nonaccruals was technical, driven by forbearance among home lending customers in the Los Angeles area due to wildfires, and does not signal increased loss expectations.
Management acknowledged ongoing industry deposit competition, but reported that commercial deposit pricing and pressure have not materially intensified due to tariffs or macro events.
CEO Dimon addressed regulatory questions by stating, ""if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer.""

Full Conference Call Transcript
Jeremy Barnum:
Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, the firm reported net income of $15 billion, EPS of $5.24 on revenue of $45.7 billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included an income tax benefit of $774 million, which we described in more detail in the earnings press release. On the next page, we have some more detail. The firm reported revenue of $45.7 billion, down $5.3 billion, or 10% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was down $185 million, or 1%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher wholesale deposits, higher revolving balances in Card, as well as the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters.
NIR ex Markets was down $6.3 billion, or 31%, and excluding the net gain related to Visa shares and net investment securities losses in the prior year was up $1 billion, or 8%, driven by higher Asset Management fees, higher auto lease income, higher Investment Banking fees and higher Payments fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.1 billion or 15%. Expenses of $23.8 billion were up $66 million, and excluding last year's Visa stock contribution to the firm's Foundation was up $1.1 billion, or 5%, primarily driven by compensation, higher brokerage and distribution fees as well as higher auto lease depreciation.
And credit costs were $2.8 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.4 billion, and a net reserve build of $439 million. The build was driven by new lending activity, largely offset by a decrease in the probabilities that we attached to the adverse scenarios and the allowance estimation. On to the balance sheet on Page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, down 40 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income was more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by an increase in wholesale lending across both CIB markets and banking, an increase in other markets activity as well as an increase in Card loans.
As you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Under the current rules, our indicative SCB is floored at 2.5% and goes into effect in 4Q '25. Our new SCB also reflects the Board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.50 per share in the third quarter. Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB. CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion on revenue of $18.8 billion, which was up 6% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management revenue was up 3%, largely driven by growth in Wealth Management revenue with deposit NII relatively flat. Average deposits were down 1% year-on-year and flat sequentially.
Client investment assets were up 14% year-on-year, driven by market performance and continued healthy flows into managed products. In Home Lending revenue was down 5% year-on-year, predominantly driven by lower NII. Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 15% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances, as well as higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 9% due to strong new card acquisition. In Auto originations were up 5%, driven by higher lease volumes. Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 5% year-on-year largely driven by growth in technology and auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.1 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, relatively flat year-on-year, in line with expectations.
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $6.7 billion, on revenue of $19.5 billion, which was up 9% year-on-year. IB fees were up 7% year-on-year. We continue to rank #1 with wallet share of 8.9%. In advisory fees were up 8%, benefiting from increased sponsor activity. Debt underwriting fees were up 12%, primarily driven by a few large deals. In equity underwriting fees were down 6% year-on-year. Our pipeline remains robust, and the outlook along with the market tone and sentiment is notably more upbeat. Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly offset by deposit margin compression.
Lending revenue was down 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher losses on hedges. Moving to Markets. Total revenue was up 15% year-on-year. Fixed income was up 14% with improved performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets, Rates and Commodities. This was partially offset by fewer opportunities in Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing. Equities was up 15%. We continue to see strong performance across products, most notably in derivatives. Security Services revenue was up 12% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year-on-year, driven by higher compensation, brokerage and technology expense, partially offset by lower legal expense.
Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and up 2% quarter-on-quarter with sequential growth, primarily driven by new loans with larger corporates. Average client deposits were up 16% year-on-year and up 5% sequentially, reflecting increased activity across Payments and Security Services. Finally, Credit costs were $696 million, driven by builds in our C&I portfolio, including new lending activity and downgrades to a handful of names, partially offset by the scenario probability adjustment, I mentioned upfront. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management to complete our lines of business. AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with a pretax margin of 34%.
Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 10% year-on-year, driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 5% year-on-year driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $31 billion for the quarter led by fixed income and equities. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $5 billion. AUM of $4.3 trillion was up 18% year-on-year, and client assets of $6.4 trillion were up 19% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels.
And finally, loans were up 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 2% sequentially. Turning to Corporate. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion and includes the tax item I mentioned upfront. Revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. NII was $1.5 billion, down $875 million year-on-year, NIR was a net gain of $49 million, up $148 million year-on-year, excluding the prior year's Visa-related gains. Expenses of $547 million were down $32 million year-on-year, excluding the Foundation contribution in the prior year that I mentioned earlier. To finish up, I'll touch on the outlook. You'll recall that at Investor Day, I made a couple of comments previewing the potential evolution of the outlook.
So now let me formalize that and give you updated guidance. First, we now expect NII ex Markets to be approximately $92 billion, with the increase driven by changes in the forward curve and strong deposit growth in Payments, Security Services as well as balanced growth in Card. Total NII guidance is now about $95.5 billion, implying $3.5 billion of Markets NII. Second, on adjusted expense, we now expect it to be about $95.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of the weaker dollar, which is largely bottom line neutral. And finally, on credit, we continue to expect the Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.6%.
So reflecting on the quarter, while the environment remains extremely dynamic in many ways, navigating uncertainty is the norm for both us and our clients. But we're now happy to take your questions. So let's open the line for Q&A.
Operator:
Our first question will come from Christopher McGratty with QBW (sic) [ KBW ].
Christopher McGratty:
Jamie, relative to 3 months ago, there's a lot of optimism on financial deregulation and really going to break in the bank's favor. I'm interested if you agree, number one, with this optimism and anything specifically you could point to? And secondarily, on capital, I'm interested in what's on or off the table in terms of uses of capital? What do you need to see from the macro regulatory? And how should we be thinking about the timing?
Jeremy Barnum:
Let me take the second part of that first. So we have our standard capital hierarchy that we recite a lot, and I want to bore you by reciting it again. But I think it's important because it does serve as a guide in this context, right? So we deploy our capital against organic and inorganic growth, and we ensure a sustainable dividend. And with what's left, we do buybacks. And so we've talked about how excess capital is earnings in store.
You saw this quarter that we actually had some financial resource usage that came through and actually meant that despite keeping the buybacks relatively constant and having organic capital generation to be relatively constant, the CET1 ratio dropped a little bit as a function of increased usage organically showing up in RWA expansion. So we're doing what we want to do, but clearly, it is a big amount of excess, and that does mean that everything is on the table as it always is, and that includes potentially inorganic things. Now obviously, that needs to be done carefully. I think acquisitions have a high bar, both financially, strategically and importantly, in some cases, culturally.
And we also need to think carefully about things that work outside the regulated perimeter might not work inside the regulated perimeter as well. We have learned some lessons. We don't want to overlearn those lessons. But in the end, sometimes we lean in a little more, sometimes lean in a little less, but we wouldn't be doing our jobs if we weren't thinking about it. I don't particularly think other than fundamentally whether things are permissible or not, that the regulatory environment right now, particularly shapes our thinking on that front.
James Dimon:
And Chris, just a broader point about regulations. I think it's very important that the regulators step back and kind of look at the big picture now, not just one picture, so nothing has happened yet. I think they should be looking at all these things. But if you look at SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR, Basel III, FSRT, the overlap, the duplication, I actually believe that you can make the system simpler, cheaper, more effective, more transparent and safer. And the things like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic did not need to happen if you just modify some things and you can create more liquidity, more loans and a safer system.
And that's really what they should be looking at, not just SLR. And so I'm hoping that over time, they do that. And then second thing that I would add to that, which I think is even maybe more important, is they should answer the question, what do they actually want in our public markets versus our private markets, et cetera. We've gone from 8,000 public companies, I'm talking about like 25 years ago to 4,000 today. That's happened overseas. Public markets overseas have gotten smaller and smaller. Obviously, I'm not against private credit. Private credit is growing. And how do you really want to structure this? And why is it happen? Is that a good thing for America?
And so I just -- it is time that they take a step back. There's been -- I hear some time from some pundits that there's been relaxing of rules and regulations, absolutely not. There's been nothing but increasing them for the better part of 15 years. They should take a deep breath, step back, and look at the system and answer the question, how can we make it better and stronger for the economy and all involved.
Jeremy Barnum:
And maybe sort of gone a bit long here, but just to expand and go into a little bit of detail there. I will note that Vice Chair Bowman gave a speech on her vision having come into the new seat for ongoing work on regulation. And I think it's a speech that's pretty comprehensive and lays out some of what Jamie is saying in terms of like the to-do list. I think at the margin, we can do understand the desire to sort of knock some things off the to-do list that have been on it for a long time and clearly needs to be addressed like SLR.
But at the same time that, that happens, the holistic review done properly across not only capital, but also liquidity, resolution, et cetera, is clearly quite important. More narrowly, in the near term, I think we continue to feel very strongly that if all the things that are out there, one of the worst is G-SIB, in the sense of both the original gold-plating, the sort of deep conceptual flaws in the framework itself, and the failure to recalibrate it for growth since it was put into effect.
And I think one of the things that's maybe a little bit under discussed there is the extent to which it specifically creates strongest incentives for American banks to be strong and globally competitive. And that is seems to be the exact opposite of what we want. So that's really one of the ones that needs to get attacked pretty aggressively, I would say.
Christopher McGratty:
I appreciate all the color. If I could ask kind of a follow-up. The inorganic comments. I'm interested in capital allocation between your businesses, where you think, if that were to present an opportunity where -- which businesses would most likely be the use of that capital?
Jeremy Barnum:
I mean we've talked about that a little bit over time. Obviously, we're not fundamentally capital constrained right now. So I mean in addition to the fact that capital isn't the only financial resource that we need to allocate, I would say the larger point is that any good franchise business that it makes sense from a risk perspective and clears the cost of equity is going to get done within reason, subject to obvious caveat. So...
James Dimon:
Inorganic, it's a good discipline to always be looking. I would have high expectations that will be how we use a lot of capital. And I think it's a very big plus that we grow organically in every business we're in without having to stretch.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.
Betsy Graseck:
So two questions. First, on the RWA utilization via organic as you described. I wanted to understand in wholesale lending, where you highlighted the CIB was a driver of much of this. Could you speak to the drivers of those drivers? In other words, is it private credit? Is it M&A financing? Is it inventory? What are you seeing in the market here that you're delivering on that's raising that lending profile?
Jeremy Barnum:
It's all of the above, Betsy, because we are the Switzerland of financing. We do everything, and we saw a lot of activity come in late in the quarter.
Betsy Graseck:
Okay. Great. All right. And then Jamie, you've -- there's been a lot of discussion around stablecoin. How stablecoin is going to be impacting banks. And I believe you have an opinion on this, would love to hear if you could highlight how JPM is thinking about utilizing, leveraging, competing with stablecoin, and how the JPMD deposit token feeds into all of this as well?
James Dimon:
So deposit token is effectively the same thing. You're moving money by token, you could pay interest. It's JPMorgan deposit. And stablecoins, we're going to be involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it. We don't know exactly -- I think they're real, but I don't know why you'd want a stablecoin as opposed to just a payment. And -- but I do think you have fintech, these guys are very smart. I'm trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts to get the payment systems and rewards programs. And we have to be cognizant of that. The way to be cognizant is to be involved.
Betsy Graseck:
Okay, super. And then separately on the topic of open banking. I think that's on hold right now with the CFPB, on hold right now. But just wanted to understand, does this hold period gave you an opportunity to change how you're pricing for your open banking and fintech relationships here?
James Dimon:
So this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer. So we think the customer has the right to, if they want to share their information. What we asked people to do is, what are they -- do they actually know what's being shared? What is actually being shared? It should be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because somebody of these things going on for years. It should not be remarketed or resold to third parties. And so we're kind of in favor of all that done properly.
And then the payment, it just -- it costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system protection. So we just think it should be done and done right. And that's the main part. It's not like you can't do it. The last thing is a liability shift. I mean I don't think JPMorgan should be responsible if you've given your bank passcodes to third parties who market and do a whole bunch of stuff with it and then you get scammed or fraud through them, they should be responsible. And we want real clarity about that.
And if you see today, a lot of these scams and frauds run through third-party social media and stuff like that, there should be a little more responsibility in their part. So we can all do a better job for the customer. That's why.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Steven Alexopoulos from TD Cowen.
Steven Alexopoulos:
I wanted to start, Jeremy, going back to your comments on inorganic things being on the table in terms of use of excess capital. So when I look at the company, so you're the largest U.S. bank by assets, you're also the largest in terms of the data you see every day. And you may or may not have seen that Apple is looking at possibly, there's chatter, getting into the AI game more by looking at a company such as Perplexity. Just thinking out loud here, would it make sense for JPMorgan to consider acquiring an LLM, right? The last 2 quarters of buybacks are about the last valuation round for Perplexity, right?
I'm thinking of you guys, you could become LLM for the financial services industry. What are your thoughts on this?
James Dimon:
We use LLMs and we're going to be agnostic about that, too. There's no reason for us to own one. At least we can't figure out why that would make sense. And I wouldn't -- we will use it, and we will obviously be important in using our data to help our customers.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. And on the question of inorganic deployment, I would sort of blend my comments with Jamie's right? In the end, I'm just asserting that, of course, we need to look at inorganic opportunities. And of course, that's a question that comes up given our current excess capital position. But Jamie said clearly that he doesn't think that's particularly likely, or some of the reasons that you emphasized, it's not easy to imagine a deal that would actually make sense.
James Dimon:
We do a lot of small ones, by the way, which you've seen.
Steven Alexopoulos:
Yes. Yes. Okay. And then going back, Jamie, to your answer to Betsy's question on the tokenized deposit. I get it, how that makes sense in terms of the customers that are inside your walled garden, but it doesn't help them much in terms of dealing with customers outside of your garden. What's holding up you guys and the other banks getting together to issue something joint, similar to what you've done with Zelle and prevent these stablecoin companies like Circle coming in and offering a more convenient solution to your customers?
James Dimon:
That's a great question. And we'll leave the remain as a question.
Steven Alexopoulos:
Without an answer?
James Dimon:
Well, I think you're raising a very important point about interoperability of stablecoins and deposits and movement of money, and what problem you're trying to solve, but you're raising a great points. You can assume we're thinking about all of that.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ebrahim Poonawala:
This almost sounds like a fintech and AI call. But maybe just switching gears, I think, Jamie, your comments in the press release, give us a sense like when we think about middle market businesses in the U.S., what's the state of play there? When we think about interest rates, tariffs, consumer spending slowing, should we be concerned in terms of credit quality outlook looking out 6, 9, 12 months? Just what's your take based on all the data that we all look at?
James Dimon:
You can ask the thing about the data, but very important, we love the middle market business. It drives a lot of business. We've built, I think 500 bank of the innovation economy, which is kind of new to us. I think of what Silicon Valley Bank used to do and things like that. We still have a huge addressable market in the middle market business. We provide not just lending, and that could be leveraged lending, direct lending, but payment services, custody services, asset management services, FX services. So we're going to grow that business, regardless of what we predict the environment is going to be in the next 6 to 9 months.
Ebrahim Poonawala:
Got it. And I guess just as a follow-on -- go ahead, Jeremy.
Jeremy Barnum:
No, go ahead, ask your follow-up.
Ebrahim Poonawala:
And I was just wondering in terms of your sense of just the state of play, the health of the balance sheets of these customers. And also if you can expand that into the consumer, any areas of stress from a credit quality perspective that you're beginning to get more concerned today versus 3 or 6 months ago?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes, right. Okay. Because that's what I was going to try to clarify. I just wasn't sure if you were doing consumer wholesale or both. So let's do consumer quickly. I think -- we talk about this every quarter. It's obviously a very important question. We look at it very closely. It obviously matters a lot for us as a company. But we continue to struggle to see signs of weakness. We just -- the consumer basically seems to be fine. Now a few things are true. Like if you look at indicators of stress, not surprisingly, you see a little bit more stress in the lower income bands than you see in the higher income bands.
But that's always true. That's pretty much definitionally true. And nothing there is out of line with our expectations. Our delinquency rates are also in line with expectations. You saw that we kept our net charge-off guidance unchanged. So all that looks kind of fine. And to be honest, as we've said before, fundamentally, while there are nuances around the edges, consumer credit is primarily about labor markets. And in a world with 4.1% unemployment rate, it's just going to be hard, especially in our portfolio to see a lot of weakness.
Now it is true that if you look at, not our data, but the government's data, I think I was looking at this the other day, like first half real consumer spending of this year versus second half of last year is down. Now it's still positive, it's still growing, but it's down. So it's kind of consistent with the sort of soft landing narrative, which is also consistent with the sort of the GDP outlook that our economists are publishing. Our own data looked sort of in nominal terms on a cohort basis, actually shows spending up a little bit over the same period.
So it's kind of the same narrative of things being fine with different signals pointing in slightly different directions, but nothing particularly concerning.
Ebrahim Poonawala:
That was helpful. And would you say the same about commercial?
Jeremy Barnum:
I mean, basically, yes, you see some idiosyncratic things here and there. And on the point of tariffs, I guess, obviously, you recall the slide that we did at Investor Day, kind of highlighting that different sectors are going to have different experiences as a function of their margins, their sensitivity to input cost, their amount of pricing power, their amount of leverage, and where the rules actually land. But people are obviously getting some time to adjust, and we're watching it very closely. So we'll see.
Operator:
Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities.
John McDonald:
Jeremy, a quick follow-up on the consumer credit, broader comments taken there. But in terms of the NPAs, the nonaccruals in consumers seem to have a bit of a jump. Is there something technical there? Maybe just talk to that.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. Thanks for that, John. I'm glad to get a chance to clarify this. There is something technical, which has to do with customers in the -- Home Lending customers in the L.A. area, using our forbearance availability as a result of the wildfires. So that is resulting in an uptick in the nonperforming. But when you think about land value, and the insurance there, the actual loss expectation is de minimis, I would say. So...
James Dimon:
We always do that for customers when they have really difficult time.
Jeremy Barnum:
Exactly. So that's what's driving that one.
John McDonald:
Okay. Great. And I wanted to ask for some more color on retail deposits. Maybe in the context of Marianne's presentation from Investor Day. Could you remind us of what's given you incremental confidence in seeing some improvement in deposit margin and kind of producing that mid- to upper single-digit deposit growth that Marianne talked about?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes, sure. So I think what you're referring to is a slide where Marianne talked about kind of the potential for 6% consumer deposit growth next year. And that's a nice number. And as you've written, that would produce some nice revenue consequences, all else being equal. The way I think about that number is to kind of build it up step by step. So you start with, in general, the consumer deposit base in the system has grown probably slightly above nominal GDP.
I think that's been true for us recently is that as a result of our market position and our pricing choices, we've probably lost a little bit of share during the rate hiking cycle sort of in isolation from yield-seeking flows. With the yield-seeking flows having abated a little bit, that relative headwind is kind of behind us, or increasingly behind us. And you've got some core growth reasserting itself. You saw us call out the growth in net new accounts in Consumer checking this quarter, and that's one of the key drivers.
And then as you know well, when you look at the franchise, we kind of have: number one, ongoing expansion; number two, seasoning of the old expansion; and number three, deepening in the core markets. So when you put all that together and you look at sort of the history of the growth macro environment, et cetera, that's how you get to that type of 6% number. Now obviously, things could change quite dramatically to produce a different number, among other things. You'll recall that Marianne's slide also talked about a stress scenario with lower rates, which perhaps somewhat non-intuitively would produce actually higher growth as a result of even less yield-seeking flow and a higher consumer savings rate.
But the flip side of that is also true, which is an unexpectedly high rate environment would probably lead to lower balance growth, all else equal in consumer. So we'd like to say, those are all else being equal type numbers, but all else is never equal.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
Michael Mayo:
Jeremy, can you talk about why commercial loan growth was much stronger in the second quarter and any strength by geography? And Jamie, can you address what regulators could do to potentially have banks lend more in the future, consistent with what the Treasury Secretary said is his goal.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. Thanks, Mike. So on loan growth, as you know, it's useful to sort of break this down between what I would think of as like relationship lending that kind of drives the whole franchise, and that we sometimes look at maybe as an indicator of the health of the Corporate sector in some sense, and people like to look at it as a read across for the smaller banks, et cetera. That part of the franchise remains fine, but sort of muted as customers have access to capital markets and revolver utilization is sort of flattish in general.
But as I noted, I think previously, and as you see coming through the IBP performance, there was just quite a bit of deal activity in the second half of the quarter, a lot of which is well known and public. And some of that is on our balance sheet, and we're very happy to have it there.
James Dimon:
And to answer your other question, Mike. So some of the -- I'm going to give you some things that you can actually do. So I think you should do them and reduce risk in the system. I'm only going to talk about how they increase lending for a second. So G-SIFI inhibits, if you look at it, both a little bit of lending and a little bit of market making. LCR inhibits both because it's a very rigid way of looking at the bank balance sheet. It doesn't really give you credit for potential access to window and things like that.
CCAR in some cases inhibits, people -- we talk about CCAR-ness, but there's a lot of CCAR-ness from small business loans and stuff like that, where people kind of hold that back a little bit because it creates too much volatility. And CCAR capital, the FSRT, the fundamental book. And when you look at all these things, I think you can create more lending, more liquidity, more flexibility and reduce the risk in the system. And also just CET, just capital usage, et cetera. So -- and reducing the risk in the system. I think we also make it friendlier for community banks, which we do want to do.
And so if you look at like total loan to deposits, they used to be 100%, they're now 70%, okay? And that's a huge difference that took place over 10 or 15 years. And can you get that back to 85% and have the banking system be just safe and sound? Absolutely.
Michael Mayo:
You didn't mention the cost to make a loan. Is there a potential for streamlining there?
James Dimon:
Yes, and I'd put securitization in that category. We need a more active securitization market and all these things can reduce the actual cost of making loan. I pointed out in the past that mortgages probably cost 30 or 40 or 50 basis points more because of excessive securitization, origination and servicing requirements. Those could be changed and would dramatically help mortgages, particularly for low-income individuals. And we've just have failed to do it for 10 years, and it wouldn't create any additional risk. And we can show you data that shows that.
Michael Mayo:
And last one, when you say inorganic growth, would you buy a private credit firm? Is that something you can at least consider?
James Dimon:
I would say it's not high on my list because we can do it ourselves and buying people and comp plans. And I also think you may have seen peak private credit a little bit. I don't know that. But we already do it. So if it was the right people at the right price, then I'm sure we should look at it. I think, Mike, you should always be open-minded when people come to you with something you hadn't thought about before. And you just get smarter by looking at these things.
Michael Mayo:
Actually, I can't leave on that comment...
Jeremy Barnum:
[indiscernible]
James Dimon:
What?
Michael Mayo:
Peak private credit, I can't leave on those three words.
James Dimon:
Well, I've mentioned that credit spreads are very low. It's grown dramatically over time, and you have to pay up a lot for it. And I'm not saying it's not going to grow some more, but I just -- I would have a slight reluctance depending on who it was. But you might -- your bankers might come to us with something tomorrow that we just hadn't thought about that is a complete natural fit for us, natural fit being product and people and culture.
Michael Mayo:
Sorry, Jeremy?
Jeremy Barnum:
No, I was literally going to say what Jamie just said, so we're good.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.
L. Erika Penala:
Jamie and Jeremy, you've talked about simplifying the regulatory construct. And it seems like based on the progress so far, we'll mostly get there, particularly with Basel III endgame and G-SIB, which impacts you so much. And to that end, if we do get a more simplified regulatory construct that addresses both the capital and liquidity constraints, does that move up JPMorgan's natural ROTCE? You talked about 17% through the cycle a lot. Obviously, perhaps we would optimize the denominator. Why wouldn't that be additive to your natural ROTCE? Or does this get passed back on to your clients in terms of pricing?
James Dimon:
In a competitive world, it is irrational to thing that -- and when it applies to all the competitors that everyone is just going to make a lot more money to keep it as opposed to compete in the marketplace. Hopefully, we'll still have a good competitive position relative to everybody else. But no, I don't think you should automatically say it's going to increase your returns. Remember, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity. That would be a huge opportunity for fintech, private credit, alternative players, et cetera. So you have to be a little careful to think that would happen. I think it's a good thing for the system, though.
Jeremy Barnum:
Exactly. And as we always said, Erika, right, like the market is very competitive, and the returns are high. And you know this, but I would just refer you to the slide that I delivered at Investor Day about how in some cases, it makes all else equal, compared to buying back shares at these prices, doing healthy, well-underwritten, compelling franchise business with a 14% return, we're definitely supposed to do that actually. And if we do a lot of that, it will dilute down the weighted average ROTCE of the company in ways that are nonetheless clearly accretive to shareholders. So...
James Dimon:
And Jeremy showed you a little thing about business units that earn high returns to low returns. Now they should do a low return ones because they fit hand in glove with other stuff, if you didn't do, you might lose the other. But there are some businesses out there with very high returns. That we just -- we deploy capital by adding bankers or branches, or products, not directly by deploying capital. So just think of branches, that does our private bank or things like that.
L. Erika Penala:
Yes, for sure. And I think that's a big discussion point with investors in terms of talking about actually the EPS gains rather than just ROTCE improvement. And the second question I had is you mentioned, and clearly, we saw it in the numbers, a late in the quarter pickup in activity levels. And I'm wondering as we think about sentiment and what this means for the second half, is it -- does activity levels pick up because it felt like we were taking extreme outcomes from tariff policy off the table? Is it the tax bill certainty?
I guess I'm just wondering, has some of the issues that prevented activity levels, or really stunted it in April and early May, have those fully been taken out of your clients thinking as we think about the second half of the year and activity levels continuing from here?
James Dimon:
Jeremy, you might want to -- I'll just answer your question by saying, honestly, we don't know. And you've seen how rapidly pipelines can grow and shrink. And so that lesson we've learned over and over, it may stay wide open for 1.5 years. Something may happen geopolitically that all of a sudden that pipeline slows a little bit. And so I'm always a little cautious to guess what that's going to be. But if it continues this way, yes, you're going to have really active markets.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. And my version of that, Erika, I would be to say that you talked about certain of the tail risk getting taken completely off the table, and that's clearly not true, right? All the tail risks are all still there quite prominently. And in many cases, in the daily news flow, maybe at the margin, the tails are a little bit less fat right now. I think it's also true that in terms of our -- what the things that we've said about our Investment Banking pipeline have been consistently quite cautious. And at a certain point, when you have the type of outperformance that you have this quarter, starts to make your cautiousness, seem less credible.
So we wanted to take a hard look at ourselves and say, what do we really think. And it's like, yes, the sentiment is better. But as Jamie says, like that can change overnight, and there are a lot of risks.
James Dimon:
I do think that extending the tax bill for business to know what their taxes are going to be is a positive going forward. And that does reduce the risk that the bill didn't get done. I also think when it comes to tariffs, I think the initial Liberation Day, now there's more talk as more things getting done, a couple have been announced, a couple have been delayed, that reduces that risk a little bit. And hopefully, they'll get done. So there's still risk out there, but I am hopeful that some of these frameworks are completed soon, at least before August 1.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.
James Mitchell:
Maybe just on, Jeremy, if I look at your 10-Q and 10-K rate sensitivity disclosures, it looks like you guys have done a lot to reduce your asset sensitivity to the short end of the curve. So can you talk about what you've been doing to change the positioning of the balance sheet, whether extending duration or hedges? And is there more you can do to desensitize the balance sheet before rate cuts begin to kick in as, I guess, the markets expect later this year?
James Dimon:
Before he goes on, look, what the market expects almost never happens.
James Mitchell:
Fair enough.
Jeremy Barnum:
All right. So it's a good question, Jim. But yes, as Jamie points out, just remember that to the extent that the market is sufficient, which maybe it's not, but you can't really hedge ahead of cuts that are already priced in, right? So that's what I'm saying out loud. But I mean you can decrease volatility, but it's just a question of now or later.
But having said that, on the question of decreasing volatility, we did, in fact, add some duration this quarter with the usual mix of instruments and strategies, but primarily in the front end of the yield curve, which was designed to essentially balance out the tails a little bit so that we were a little bit less exposed to a classic recessionary type scenario with much lower rates in exchange for accepting a little bit less good outcomes in like higher rate scenarios, at least narrowly through the lens of NII. As we've talked about a little bit over time, though, I like the way you framed it in terms of like having the capacity.
And I think the way to think about it there is that in general, it's almost impossible to get your assets -- for a bank like us, it's almost impossible to get your asset sensitivity, your actual asset sensitivity down to 0, because you wind up constrained by other things. So we're in the corridor, and we're okay with where we are right now.
James Mitchell:
Okay. And maybe just one more on the regulatory front. I think regulators looked at reducing the SLR as a way to encourage banks, or open up an avenue to expand your balance sheet into lower-risk assets. Do you see that -- is it really just a supply issue? Or how do you think about the demand/supply dynamic? And is there really opportunities for you to grow? I would imagine, I guess, with an SLR not being constrained, maybe it's better return in lower-margin areas? Just your thoughts.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. It's a good question. You may recall, I actually got a version of this question at Investor Day, so I'll more or less repeat my answer here, which is that as we know, fixing SLR has been on the list for a long time. It behaved very much not the way it was designed in the moment of big QE when it became binding and it had bad impacts on the system. It's the opposite of what we want from these backstop measures. And so we don't want regulators to need to make unusual corrections amid crises. It's just not the right way to run the railroad. I think everyone has agreed on that for a long time.
And in that context, it's been sort of disappointing that something as obvious as this has taken as long as this to get fixed. But it's a good sign that it's now out there, and we certainly support the proposal. There are some nuances that comment have been requested, but at a high level, it's a good proposal. It's the right thing to do. And it's the right thing to do from the perspective of the resilience of the system for the next time that we've got that type of expansion in the size of the system that could make it binding in the wrong way for the wrong reasons.
But yes, as you noted, and as we've said, we're not really bound by it. I think other actors in the market may be a little bit more bound by it. There are also some nuances about impact on portfolio activity, which I would expect to be very small, versus impact on low-risk intermediation in the market-making businesses, which is maybe where you would hope to see the effect. So it's a good thing. Hopefully, it will help. Obviously, it's pretty fully priced in at this point.
So I don't think you're going to see a big pop one way or the other as a function of it's eventually being finalized because I think everyone is assuming it will go in roughly in its current form.
James Dimon:
And I'm like a broken record. It's not SLR, it's LCR, it's G-SIFI, it's CCAR, it's Basel IV, the gold-plating. You really got to step back and look at all of them, and how you use the discount window, et cetera. And even how you measure liquidity, which is different in one measure than it is in resolution recovery. They should look at all of that. If they really want to fix the system.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Ken Udsen (sic) [ Ken Usdin ] from Autonomous.
Kenneth Usdin:
First question is I just wanted to ask you about the recent Sapphire price changes and just what you're seeing in terms of initial response, and just how that fits in strategically with the competitive landscape on Card and your growth opportunity?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes, sure. So let me dispense with the question on how it's going...
James Dimon:
So far.
Jeremy Barnum:
Going fine. We're happy. In terms of strategic aspects of this and the competitive landscape, I think the way we think about this is as a normal course refresh of one of our important products in the way that all of our products get refreshed periodically. Obviously, this is a relatively high-profile product. Many of us have the Card. We see the ads everywhere. So it sort of punches above its weight in that respect in terms of visibility. In terms of the competitive landscape, I think the thing that we feel really great about is the dramatic increase in the customer value proposition associated with the Card.
And in particular, one of the things that we look at is the ratio of the customer value to the annual fee, which is clearly market leading at this point. So...
James Dimon:
I've got a lot of comments that people -- from friends and my kids and stuff like that, that ""Man, you're going to raise the Card, but you have to keep it for the LaGuardia lounge.
Jeremy Barnum:
And then some, there's a lot of value added...
James Dimon:
Stuff, yes, exactly.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. Yes. So yes, and obviously, I mean, we're not going to talk too much about competitors. But as you know, the Card space is very competitive and very dynamic. So this is -- we exist in a competitive landscape, and this is our best foot forward on this product at this moment in time.
Kenneth Usdin:
Got it. It is a quite nice lounge. On the trading side, I'm just wondering how much the strong results this quarter, the quarter changed a lot from April to June. And I'm just wondering how much do you think that was environmental? Has it calmed down at all? And also how much is just your ability to kind of use the balance sheet to boost results also, could that make it more sustainable regardless of what the environment is doing?
Jeremy Barnum:
It's a good question. Honestly, I think it's kind of all of the above, basically. No question that the tone shifted. Obviously, it shifted in Investment Banking. I think I personally was a little bit surprised by the resilience of the Markets revenues in the second half of the quarter because I was sort of expecting a little bit of an offset between the two.
James Dimon:
I was not surprised.
Jeremy Barnum:
Okay, there you have it. But it's not like I thought it would do badly, but it sort of did quite well in the volatility in the first half of the quarter and then it got quiet. But despite that, we still did nicely. And I think the point actually, sort of to your question is that, yes, we are seeing opportunities to deploy capital and other resources. And yes, maybe at the margin, that does contribute a little bit to durability. We've talked over time about the Markets revenues and the dramatic increase. I mean, obviously, 2019 is a long time ago at this point, and we expect those revenues to grow with GDP anyway.
But we worried a lot in certain moments about the revenues dropping back to some old run rate. And then we kind of stopped worrying about that. And now of course, they've gone up to new highs, so maybe we should be worried again. But the thing I'd like to remind myself of to your point, is that while the revenues have gone up a lot, the resource usage has also gone up a lot. So we are deploying a lot of capital and all the resources in this business, and we're earning good returns on it. But the revenue growth is not coming for free. So it's us running the place, basically.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew O'Connor:
Some regional banks have pointed to...
Jeremy Barnum:
Matt, you've got some major static on the line. I don't know if we're going to be able to hear you. Just give it a shot.
Matthew O'Connor:
Can you hear me better now?
Jeremy Barnum:
Not really, but let's try.
Matthew O'Connor:
I just wanted to ask about any pressure from Commercial and Corporate customers to try to offset the tariff impact from regional banks have pointed to deposit pricing pressure on the commercial side, and if you're seeing any signs of that or more broadly speaking?
Jeremy Barnum:
I think if I heard the question correctly, you were asking...
James Dimon:
What's the tariff pressure with pressure on loans or debt. The answer is no.
Jeremy Barnum:
The answer is no. Yes. I wish we could say more about it, but we think the answer is no.
James Dimon:
No, I mean. There's always pressure in some of those.
Jeremy Barnum:
It's a competitive market, right? There is ongoing -- our deposits are very, very competitive and there are always pricing conversations as there should be. Hard to know in any given moment what's driving it, but I haven't heard anything to support a tariff-linked narrative.
Operator:
Next, we will go to the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Glenn Schorr:
Just two quick follow-ups. On the conversation about the noticeably upbeat robust pipelines. I know we've been here before and markets can give us and take it away. But there is a time value in there, meaning corporates, and more importantly sponsors, need to get stuff done. There is a ton of dry powder. So I'm curious if that -- if there's a higher level of confidence, meaning if the market doesn't take from us, is it really happening this time? We've been kind of waiting for these pipelines to come through in fuller force for a couple of years now.
Does it -- is it feel more doable as long as the market doesn't take the rug out from under us?
James Dimon:
I think it separate sponsor-owned companies from IPOs. There are companies going public. They're in the pipeline. They want to go public, et cetera. Sponsors are still, at least from what I can tell, anecdotally still reluctant to use the public markets. There may obviously be maybe more of it, but it hasn't been a mount of stuff coming out.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. I think that's right in the IPO space, at least for now. But I have heard some things to support some elements of your narrative, Glenn, to the effect of that there is pressure to kind of recycle capital and get things done. And yes, sure, after the initial shock of the tariff policy changes, everyone kind of went on hold. But as we've noted in our comments a few times today, at a certain moment, you just have to move on with life. And it does feel like some of that is happening just because you can't delay forever.
Glenn Schorr:
I hear you. The follow-up on the capital conversation. Obviously, impressive to see big returns on even higher capital basis. But there's more to come. And I think trend is your friend on D Reg. So the question is, you keep making a lot of money, your capital base keeps rising. You've talked about arresting the growth of CET1 in the past. But I guess my blunt question is, is there any valuation limitation towards that arresting of CET1?
Jeremy Barnum:
Okay. I want to say a couple of things, and then I want to clarify an aspect of your question, Glenn. So first, on arresting the growth, what I actually said, not to nitpick on you, but I said arresting the growth of excess capital, which I agree is reasonable to interpret as keeping a roughly constant CET1. As it happens this quarter, you see the CET1 actually dropping about 40 basis points, and that was in no small part a function of significant late quarter growth in RWA usage, which we were frankly like very happy to see, in fact. So that's all to the good in some sense.
Now the other part of your question, can you just repeat it? I want to make sure I understand it.
Glenn Schorr:
I'm just curious if there's a valuation limitation the thinking? Meaning as valuation goes up, are you just going to -- do you keep buying back stock...
Jeremy Barnum:
So meaning would we go back to a moment of reducing buybacks and starting to build again if the stock gets even more expensive? I mean, I think that's the question for the boss. But I don't know, I guess we always reserve the right to do whatever we want on buybacks basically.
James Dimon:
Reserve the right. We're not going to tell you. But obviously, the stock pricing -- I mean I don't like buying back the stock at almost 3x tangible book. No one is going to convince me that's a brilliant thing to do, but it is wise to use our balance sheet for customers, which we're doing. And we can maybe possibly do more. And it is probably wise to not increase the excess capital anymore since we have plenty, and it's going to be going up. But look, I'm completely convinced if you take out of your mindset 12 months. We will use the capital wisely for shareholders.
And the best way is organic growth, which I wouldn't rule out that we can find more ways to grow clients, basically.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
Gerard Cassidy:
I'd like to circle back to the return on tangible common equity topic that you guys have discussed. Obviously, you had a very strong number this quarter, 20% when you adjusted for the onetime effect. And you go back to your Investor Day and you pointed out 17% is what the targeted level is. And if you turn back the clock and go back to 2020, you had the same 17% goal for the ROTCE, but your CET1 ratio back then was guidance -- guidance was 11.5% to 12%. So my question is, has the business for you folks changed so much that now it's just inherently a more profitable business?
James Dimon:
Jeremy, you can answer this one. I just might add really be an important point. The value to shareholders is that we cannot just earn 17% ROTCE is that we can reinvest money at 17% ROTCE. That's the value. If you're just going to earn 17% you're a bond, then you will trade at 3x tangible book, but that's it for the rest of your life. And so the goal is to find opportunities to grow and expand your franchise, which we are doing. If you look at it, we are doing that with branches and bankers internationally. And when we look at the mid-cap business we're doing in Europe is it's been great. Innovation economy has been great.
We're gaining shares in a lot of places, Chase Wealth Management and the Private Bank, the international -- payment systems, we're investing in all those things to grow our franchises, and that's the best way to use your capital. And forget the timetable of that is the best way to use it.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. And Gerard, I guess, on your other question, it's an interesting question. I don't think the answer is really knowable. And I feel like it's kind of all of the above. And let me say what I mean. Like on the one hand, I think if you look at the current market environment, it's hard to imagine a set of conditions that would be any better for us, right? Rates are at a good level for us. Deal activity is high. Capital markets are very strong. Consumer credit is excellent. Wholesale credit is excellent. Wealth Management, Asset Management. I mean essentially every part of the company is firing.
We're essentially firing on all cylinders with some very minor exceptions of certain businesses that are extremely rate sensitive, like Home Lending, where they're still doing a great job in what is a very tough market. So when you see that, you're like, well, that's not normal. Normally, you would have some pockets doing a little better, some pockets doing a little worse. And that's part of what makes you think that some aspects of this are maybe not sustainable. On the other hand, it's also true that core elements of the strategy are working very well.
And we've been investing for a long time very successfully and kind of leaning in even in moments where from the outside, there wasn't that much appetite for us to be investing in all of the things that Jamie is talking about. Some of those investments in various ways are paying off. So...
James Dimon:
You have all of our major bank competitors are back, rolling and expanding. Then you have the fintech folks, who are quite capable and quite smart, who you don't want to take big chunks of your business. Everything we do is kind of competitive around the world. So the notion is that somehow we're not going to deal with tough competitors, right, which protects JPMorgan Chase, if we don't get complacent, we don't get arrogant, we don't get bureaucratic. And we keep on realizing -- you keep on finding that you got to have to fight for it every day. And so we're quite cautious to just declare victory, like somehow we're entitled to these returns forever.
I also pointed out, if you could compound at 17%, because I had Jeremy do this number one point, if you compounded at 17% for 20 years, you probably would have a good chunk of the GDP of the United States of America -- for 40 years maybe.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. I always have to go put new batteries in my HP 12c, when you ask me that question. All right. Yes...
Gerard Cassidy:
Jeremy, I'm glad you're still using HP 12c. That's good. Just as a follow-up...
James Dimon:
He just uses his big brain. He doesn't need the 12c.
Jeremy Barnum:
[indiscernible]
Gerard Cassidy:
As a quick follow-up, Jeremy, you touched on...
James Dimon:
[indiscernible] 40, but it's not true because we not do that.
Gerard Cassidy:
Just as a quick follow-up, Jeremy. In the Markets comment that you made, you said that there were fewer opportunities in Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing. Can you expand upon that or give us any color there?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes, sure. I mean it's just normal diversification inside the Markets business. Those businesses are doing great. But like at the margin, in the second half of the quarter, well, stuff was a little quieter relative emerging markets and the macro space, which was a little bit better. But nothing too dramatic.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC.
Saul Martinez:
Just one for me, I just want to follow up on Ken's question about sales and trading. And I think you kind of addressed this, Jeremy. But I just -- you had another strong quarter there on the back of a pretty exceptional Q1 on the back of really strong 2024. I mean how are you thinking about how much of this is the result of an exceptional trading environment versus something that's more durable? And presumably less volatility, good for Investment Banking, but do you see -- would you see some sort of normalization in sales and trading as a result? Or do you think there's still opportunities to grow certain businesses and take share?
Just curious how much -- how you think about what's exceptional versus what's more durable here?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. I mean one thing I'll say is that there's no like weird exceptional thing happening in this particular quarter are driving the results. So it's pretty broad-based. And it's not like particularly lumpy. And as I said, I think it is true, and I think we've shared some of this in different ways including in my slide at Investor Day, that we are deploying quite a bit of capital and other resources like G-SIB capacity and liquidity in some cases, to generate that revenue. And we're happy with the returns. But it's sort of -- it's not just like growing without any inputs essentially.
So I guess, on the one hand, you might say that, that's a bit more durable for that reason. But it is important to realize that it's coming with that use of resources essentially. So I mean, we've gotten over time, a little bit more relaxed about talking about the Markets business as something that has relatively uncorrelated and reasonably recurring revenues. It's obviously extremely client-centric. There's a lot of financing of various types that's being supplied. And it seems to, if anything, more often than not be countercyclical rather than procyclical. But it's still Markets, right? Things can happen. It's volatile, there's risk taking involved.
That's part of the point that -- sorry to hedge the answer, but that's kind of how we think about it.
Operator:
Our final question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Christoph Kotowski:
Kind of an old-school bank analyst question. After a long time of kind of bemoaning slow C&I loan growth, you had this extraordinary growth this quarter, $33 billion on average and more than 6% quarter-over-quarter. But then when we look at the P&L in the Commercial & Investment Bank, net interest income is down 2% and lending income is down 4%. And I know there's hedges and other complicated things, but it just kind of doesn't compute that you'd have such strong loan growth and not have revenue growth associated with that.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. I mean the hedges are definitely part of it. And a lot of the assets came on the balance sheet quite late in the quarter. So I don't know, I might be missing something. And there's probably some Markets NII piece of it, too. So I don't know Mikael can follow up with you, but that -- I think the loan thing is part of it, Markets NII is part of it, and late quarter -- balance sheet, and the hedges for sure.
Operator:
We have no further questions.
Jeremy Barnum:
Thanks very much.
James Dimon:
Thank you.

Risks
Jeremy Barnum stated that ""where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge,"" indicating material risk to the card segment should regulation proceed.
Management described the integration of the Apple Card business as requiring ""two years for a reason,"" with substantial technology adaptation, implying both operational risk and higher near-term expenses related to integration.
Elevated advanced RWA from the Apple Card transaction is flagged as temporary, but the near-term increase to $110 billion signals interim pressure on capital ratios.
Summary
J.P. Morgan Structured Products B.V.
(
JPM
+0.53%
)
reported quarterly revenue growth of 7% to $46.8 billion, with the Apple Card acquisition increasing both reserves and risk-weighted assets. Asset and Wealth Management achieved record client asset net inflows of $553 billion, supporting growth in management and performance fees. Management reaffirmed 2026 guidance for net interest income at $103 billion and adjusted expenses at $105 billion, citing ongoing investment across technology and business lines. The firm also outlined plans to continue capital deployment, emphasizing returns through the cycle rather than annual efficiency targets. Strategic outlook includes measured deposit and card loan growth, but signals moderation compared to prior year levels.
Jeremy Barnum highlighted that CCB's net checking account openings and client asset growth have not fully translated into proportional deposit growth due to persistent, though moderating, yield-seeking flows.
Advanced RWA associated with the Apple Card deal is anticipated to decline from $110 billion to $30 billion in the near term, but capital distribution outpaced net income this quarter, temporarily reducing CET1 ratio.
Jamie Dimon observed that macroeconomic tailwinds and deregulation support a positive short- to medium-term outlook, but stressed heightened geopolitical and fiscal risks that could eventually impact the industry.
Management reported persistent competitive pressure in consumer deposits and persistent optimism for AWM driven by adviser and banker hiring, product innovation, and continued inflows.
Barnum addressed regulatory capital questions by refraining from a set “management buffer,” emphasizing that capital numbers are already set to handle maximum stress, and Jamie Dimon noted, ""There's no scenario where capital is gonna be the issue.""

Full Conference Call Transcript
Jeremy Barnum:
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, the firm reported net income of $13 billion and EPS of $4.63 with an ROTCE of 18%. These results included the previously announced reserve build of $2.2 billion NCCV related to the forward purchase commitment of the Apple Card portfolio. Revenue of $46.8 billion was up 7% year on year on higher markets revenue as well as higher asset management fees and auto lease income. The increase in NII ex markets was primarily driven by higher firm-wide deposit and revolving balances in card, largely offset by the impact of lower rates.
Expenses of $24 billion were up 5% year on year, predominantly driven by higher volume and revenue-related expenses and compensation growth, including from office hiring, partially offset by the release of an FDIC special assessment accrual. Turning to the full year results, I'll remind you that there were a few significant items in 2025 which are listed in the footnote. Excluding those items, the firm reported full-year net income of $57.5 billion, EPS of $20.18, revenue of $185 billion with an ROTCE of 20%.
And in terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of 14.5%, down 30 basis points versus the prior quarter as net income was more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's higher standardized RWA is driven by increases in lending across both wholesale and retail including the Apple Card purchase commitment, which contributed about $23 billion of standardized RWA partially offset by lower market risk RWA. You'll see that sequentially, the advanced RWA is up more significantly than standardized. And as you know, our SCB is now at the two and a half percent floor which makes advanced RWA more relevant, so we have added it to the page.
The Apple Card transaction's advanced RWA contribution about $110 billion based on the sum of expected drawn balances and undrawn lines on closing. The elevated level of Advanced RWA is temporary and is expected to reduce to approximately $30 billion in the near term. Moving to our businesses. DCP reported net income of $3.6 billion or $5.3 billion excluding the reserve build for the Apple Card portfolio. Revenue of $19.4 billion was up 6% year on year, predominantly driven by higher NII on higher revolving balances in card, and a higher deposit margin in banking and wealth management. A few points to highlight. Consumers and small businesses remain resilient. We continue to monitor leading indicators for any signs of stress.
And despite weak consumer sentiment, trends in our data are largely consistent with historical norms and we are not currently seeing deterioration. Cross income groups, debit and credit sales volume continued to perform well, up 7% year on year. For the full year, we had strong growth in our franchise with 1.7 million net new checking accounts, 10.4 million new card accounts, and record households in wealth management across digital and advised channels. Next, the CIB reported net income of $7.3 billion. Revenue of $19.4 billion was up 10% year on year driven by higher revenues in markets, payments, and security services.
To give a bit more color, IB fees were down 5% year on year, reflecting a strong prior year compare and the timing of some deals that were pushed to 2026. In terms of the outlook, we expect strong client engagement and deal activity in 2026, supported by constructive market dynamics which is reflected in our pipeline. Markets, fixed income was up 7% year on year, with strong performance in securitized products, rates, and currencies in emerging markets. Largely offset by lower revenue and credit trading. Equities was up 40% with robust performance across the franchise, particularly in prime. Turning to asset and wealth management. AWM reported net income of $1.8 billion with a pretax margin of 38%.
Revenue of $6.5 billion was up 13% year on year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows as well as higher performance fees. Long-term net inflows were $52 billion for the quarter, $29 billion for the full year, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $105 billion for the quarter and $183 billion for the year. And we saw record client asset net inflows of $553 billion for the year. To finish up the fourth quarter results, Corporate reported net income of $3.7 billion and revenue of $1.5 billion.
Before I go over the outlook, I want to make a few points on nonbank financial institution lending given the attention it received last quarter. When we look at NVFI lending internally, we use a narrower definition than what the call report uses. Our definition focuses on exposure to nonbank financial institutions that is collateralized by the loans the NVFIs are making to end borrowers. At the top of the page, we've provided a reconciliation of the regulatory definition to our definition. And as you can see, that results in excluding, for example, subscription lending to private equity funds resulting in about $160 billion of exposure as of the fourth quarter.
We've also given you categories of the exposure that we believe are a bit more intuitive and map to recognizable industry categories and business models of the MBF. Now looking at the bottom left, you can see that even though our narrower definition produces a smaller absolute number, the growth over the last seven years has been quite significant no matter how you look at it. And the drivers of that growth are well understood in terms of market dynamics, and regulatory pressures. In terms of risk, on the bottom right of the page, we've given you some detail on the structural features associated with different versions of this lending and the different asset classes.
Even the significant amount of credit enhancement involved in this activity as well as the absence of a traditional credit cycle during the period it's not surprising that when we look at the loss history since 2018, we've only seen one charge-off. One related to apparent fraud. Stepping back, in light of the growth and the novel elements of some components of this activity, we are quite mindful of the risks. But given the structural protections, you would generally expect losses in this NVFI category to appear either as a result of additional instances of fraud-like problems or as a result of a particularly deep recession erodes all the credit enhancement.
In that scenario, losses associated with traditional lending to end borrowers would likely be the greater concern for the industry. Now turning to the outlook for 2026. We continue to expect NII in its markets to be about $95 billion. The drivers we explained last quarter remain largely the same, so I'll cover them quickly. Usual, the outlook follows the forward curve, which currently assumes two rate cuts. Offsetting that is the expectation for continued loan growth in card, was slightly less than last year as the REVOLVE normalization tailwind is behind us as well as modest firm-wide deposit growth.
For completeness, we expect total NII to be about $103 billion for the year as a function of markets NII increasing to about $8 billion due to lower funding costs from the rate cuts, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR. On expense, as we told you at an industry conference in December, we expect 2026 adjusted expense to be about $105 billion. Broadly, the expense growth continues to align with where we see the greatest opportunities across our businesses. The details of the thematic drivers are listed on the page and are broadly consistent with what we told you before.
On the slide, we've shown you 2024 and 2025 as well as 2026 and called out the foundation contribution and the FDIC's funding assessment. And adjusting for those, the 2026 growth looks a bit more in line. So 2026 in isolation clearly represents meaningful expense growth in both dollar and percentage terms. And that growth reflects our structural optimism about the opportunity set for the company. When we look through the cycle, as well as some optimism about the near-term revenue outlook. More generally, the environment is only getting more competitive, and so it remains critical that we are making the necessary investments to secure our position against both traditional and nontraditional competitors.
To wrap up, on credit, we expect the 2026 card net charge-off rate to be approximately 3.4% unfavorable delinquency trend driven by the continued resilience of the consumer. We're now happy to take your questions. Let's open the line for Q and A.
Operator:
Thank you. Please standby. Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.
Glenn Schorr:
Hi, thanks very much. I wanna ask on the stablecoin issue. This week, we're gonna have some markings up and talk in congress. I saw the ABA letter this week talking about the immediacy of the issue and whether or not they can close the loophole on interest on Stablecoin. And I think they've estimated that or treasury estimated that it's, like, $6.6 trillion of bank deposits could be at risk if they don't close that loophole. So my question is, it was written from the ABA standpoint, the Computing Bank standpoint. Is there any reason why it wouldn't be all banks, you specifically?
And then how big of a deal the banking system if they're not successful closing that hold? Because it does put people at risk of not having insurance and all that stuff. So I'll let you all pine. Thanks. Right. Okay. Thanks, Glenn.
Jeremy Barnum:
I'll start by saying you probably know more about this than I do. And I think Mary Anne is really the expert at this point, and she did give some comments about this at a recent industry conference. But I'll give you my brief take broken into a couple of pieces. So one, you know, it's worth saying, although it's not directly responsive to your question, that as a company, we've been quite involved in the whole blockchain technology space for some time. And through our Connexus offering, are doing a bunch of kind of really cool stuff across both wholesale. As you know, we launched the first our first tokenized money market fund.
And so a capability that we've developed over a long period of time. We have really cutting edge inversion there, and we're kind of using that kind of across the whole company as we engage more in that ecosystem. On a related point, also, I think in CCB, know, we're plugging in a little bit more to the crypto ecosystem and you know, we have an agreement with Coinbase, and it's gonna know, be possible to buy crypto up in the in the CCB ecosystem too. So I say that all my way of saying that, like, we see the interesting developments in the space, the technological innovation, we're engaged. We're watching. We care.
Glenn Schorr:
On How would you how would you do it?
Jeremy Barnum:
Add one quick thing. That letter was signed by the ABA, the FSF, the ICBA. It was all banks. It wasn't a handful of banks.
Glenn Schorr:
Okay.
Jeremy Barnum:
Didn't actually know that, so helpful. And I think that what I was gonna say narrowly about that point is there I think it's a two-part answer to your question. One, I think it's very clear, and it's in the spirit of the Genius Act legislation and everything that we're advocating for, that, you know, the creation of a parallel banking system that is sort of you know, has all the features of banking, including something that looks a lot like a deposit that pays interest without sort of the associated credentials safeguards, that have been developed over hundreds of years of bank regulation is an obviously, like, dangerous and undesirable thing.
And so that is the core of our advocacy. Your narrow question of, like, if this doesn't turn out the way we're arguing it should, what is the risk in banking system deposits? I actually think that's a pretty complicated question, and it involves a lot of nuances about does the money come from, where does it go, what securities are purchased from whom, what is the impact on system-wide deposits, And how does that sort of move between consumer and wholesale? But, clearly, there is some risk for some firms, maybe for many firms, and some version of a threat to the business model I think, you know, we always embrace competition.
So this is not about saying that don't wanna compete, but it's about avoiding the creation of a parallel ecosystem that has all the same economic properties and risks without appropriate regulation. And so you know? And the final point to say, I guess, is that in the end, all of our thinking around this from a customer perspective and from an investment and from a franchise perspective, is organized around the question of what actual benefit does the consumer get. So as much as like, the technology is cool and there's interesting stuff there, in the end, you have to ask yourself, how does this actually make the consumer experience better?
And in the cases where it does, you know, we either need to get involved or improve our own service offering. In the case where it doesn't, you sort of sometimes it's a little bit of a solution in search of a problem. So I think the question of the quote, unquote, risks to existing business models and banking system deposits needs to be looked at through that lens. But it's always an important question, and our CCB folks are spending a lot of time on that.
Glenn Schorr:
I appreciate that. I have a very short, narrow follow-up. You noted the 1.7 million net new checking accounts opened for the year, and deposit growth is small, but I also noted the 17% growth in client investment assets. Is that all of it? Or are there other things at play that's limiting deposit growth despite all this great checking account growth?
Jeremy Barnum:
Oh, interesting. So I think what you're saying implicitly is, like, is the reason that growth in checking account balance is relatively muted. That sort of investment flows are competing that away in some sense. Good question. I would say partially, but not really. I guess the broader narrative is about sort of attention between the very robust franchise growth, which you've alluded to, with the 1.7 million net new accounts, offset against the systems, albeit at a much lower level of yield flows. So to the extent that you consider flows into investments, yield-seeking flows, I think there is a relationship between the two.
But I would probably put more traditional yield-seeking flows you know, higher up the list relative to investments, but it's clearly both. And so, yeah, as we talked about over the prior few quarters, like, the level of yield-seeking flows dropped off a lot. But it's not zero. And so as we talked about last quarter, when you combine that with a slightly lower savings rate and a couple of other dynamics, that sort of moment where we were expecting the balance per account number in CCB to start growing again, has just been pushed out a little bit.
And so that's the reason, you know, that we talked about previously, I think, last quarter, that our expectations for consumer deposit growth in 2026 are lower than they had been in our scenario analysis. At investor day, and that remains the case.
Glenn Schorr:
Alright. That was awesome. Thank you. Thanks, Glenn.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous. Your line is open.
Ken Usdin:
Thanks. Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, you mentioned when you were talking about the expense outlook that there's obviously part of the investment cycle there. You mentioned that the revenue growth outlook in there also looks pretty good. I was just wondering and we can see that in the volume-based parts of the growth. But I'm just wondering, have your NII outlook, we have your expenses. Just what parts of the fees are you expecting to be strong? You mentioned some deals pushed out in IB.
If you can kinda just help us flavor you know, kinda understand, like, just where the biggest drivers of fee revenue growth are gonna be as you look across the businesses to help us kind of, know, fill in a little bit? Thank you.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes, good question. So and I sort of chose my words carefully there because I think there are two versions of this in terms of expenses and investments in terms of, like, short term versus long term. So narrowly, when you look at 2026, we do show you there volume and revenue-related expense which what we traditionally describe as good expense. And, certainly, that is a driver of the overall growth in expenses. We do also note in there's a significant chunk of that as auto lease depreciation, which is, you know, essentially, it should be thought of as primarily a counter revenue item or whatever. So, you know, there's some optimism about the fee environment embedded there.
So to answer your question directly, breaking down 2026, I obviously don't wanna kind of break our tradition of not guiding on fees slash an IR given how market dependent they are and volatile they are. But, you know, you won't be surprised to hear that we're obviously optimistic on investment banking fees generally. I would say on markets, we're very optimistic about the franchise, and the environment is quite supportive, but it was an exceptionally strong year this year. So as we always say in markets, the number will be whatever it'll be, and we'll fight to make it as big as possible.
And on the rest of the kind of fee items, the sort of broad wealth management, asset management across both CCB and AWM, again, you know, we're very optimistic about know, the position of the franchise there and the associated implications for fees. But we're a little bit cautious about sort of market appreciation drivers given kinda where we're launching from and given the type of year that it's been this year. So it's a little bit of a balanced scenario, I would say, in terms of fee outlook for 2026, not for any particular negative reason, but just because, you know, 2025 was so exceptionally strong.
And then just to briefly pivot to the larger point, the distinction I'm drawing too is the relationship between 2026, you know, projected expense growth and the associated 2026 revenues versus the broader category of investments in long-term growth of the franchise, kind of the top bar of the page, across, you know, bankers, branches, product capabilities, etcetera, which is also a reflection of optimism about long-term optimism that, you know, this is a franchise that rewards investment across all of its parts.
Ken Usdin:
Excellent. Thank you for that, Jeremy. And, you know, the follow-up, that balancing act also is I think you guys have been more than fine not counting on positive operating leverage every year. How do you balance where your efficiency ratio versus your ROE outputs are given that you're still on this really strong upper teens zone that is obviously still generating tons of capital and allowing you to do a lot with the company.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yeah. I mean, I guess I would sort of anchor my answer on that one on the word output that you used. So on a couple of dimensions. So if you remember, my Day presentation, we talked a little bit about, you know, the way that we think about capital deployment sort of across the descending stack of marginal return opportunities. And the fact that we will very much deploy large amounts of capital below 17% because the alternative is to buy back stock at implied returns that are much, much, much lower than that. And that's a good thing, and we don't apologize for that, and we think it's shareholder accretive.
So for that reason, we really are starting to pivot much more to really discuss the through the cycle ROTCE target as simply an output of, like, our overall business strategy and the intelligent deployment of our financial resources and our investments, across the entire opportunity set. And in some respects, that's also true about the efficiency ratio. You know? In the end, we do what we need to do to compete. We're gonna invest what we need to invest to secure the future of the company and to drive the revenue growth that we need to drive.
And, you know, as long as what we're doing is still expected to be long-term profitable, in some sense, you know, the efficiency ratio is a bit of an output, Jamie always says that, you know, perennially expanding know, the notion of you know, constant operating leverage mathematically implies perennially expanding margins, which is an obvious impossibility a highly competitive business that we operate in.
So it is a good sanity check, you know, when that number drifts high, maybe you have to look a little harder at your expenses and make sure that everything that you're doing is you know, what you want it to be with the maximum possible efficiency, but we sort of do that all the time anyway. So that's what I would say in response to that. I would just say the capital is invested to get a good return through the cycle. You know, which means sometimes you have a better efficiency ratio, sometimes you have a worse efficiency ratio. It's kind of more of an outcome of the decisions you make.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
John McDonald:
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about credit card business. I mean, guess, first, in terms of the Apple Card acquisition, maybe you could talk about the attraction of that business to you guys, both the actual book and also what you're hoping to get out of the co-brand partnership. And the platform more broadly?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes, absolutely. So let me start by pointing out what I think is obvious but is worth saying. In light of you know, how much attention this deal has gotten, which is that as you say, like, from a narrow perspective, just in terms of the portfolio and the transaction, this is, you know, an economically compelling transaction for us. As a co-brand deal. I think someone described it, you know, as a win-win-win for all three parties, and I think that's very much how we feel about it. So that's a good starting point.
And then in addition to that, you know, obviously, you're talking here about a partnership with Affirm, Apple, that is, you know, a leader in, you know, payments innovation, and user experience and then obviously, like, a very compelling distribution channel for card. And so what's gonna be challenging for us you know, the integration is gonna take two years for a reason. We feel confident that we'll get it done successfully, and I think the process of getting it done in a narrow sense is gonna make us better. Just generally accelerate and challenge our modernization agenda and the user-friendliness of everything we do in the card business. And beyond that, you know, we'll see.
We'll see what comes out of the partnership. But, obviously, you know, anyone should be thrilled to be in a partnership with Apple.
John McDonald:
Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then maybe you, or Jamie could provide some thoughts on the idea of regulators putting caps on credit card APRs, just potential impacts on the industry and how you would think through strategic reactions as a big issuer?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yeah, thanks John. And I appreciate the way you framed the question because the thing that I'm sort of trying to avoid doing is spend a lot of energy or time speculating on the probability that this does or doesn't happen in whatever form it does or doesn't happen. So I think for the purposes of this call, and, obviously, you can assume that institutionally, we'll be doing all the well-relevant contingency planning.
But for the purposes of this call, given how little we know at this point, the way I would prefer to talk about it is just assume for the sake of argument that something in the general mode of price controls on credit card interest rates goes through. What would be the consequences of that? And I think the first thing to say, you obviously know very well, is that the card ecosystem is an exceptionally competitive ecosystem. It's among the most competitive businesses that we operate in, and that's true for all levels of borrower credit score from a high FICO to low FICO.
And so in that context, when you just basic economics, when you start with that as your starting point, you know, the right assumption about what the response of the system is going to be to the imposition of police controls is not that you will simply compress the profit margins, which are already at their sort of competitively optimal level, and thereby pass on benefits to consumers. What's actually simply going to happen is that the provision of the service will change dramatically. Specifically, you know, people will lose access to credit. Like, on a very, very extensive and broad basis. Especially the people who need it the most, chronically.
And so that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers. And, frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now. I don't wanna let this without saying that I think it should be obvious that would also be bad for us. I'm not gonna get into quantifying, but in a narrow sense, this is a big business for us. It's a very competitive business, but we wouldn't be in it if it weren't a good business for us. And in a world where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge, clearly.
Beyond that, you know, the way we actually respond would have a lot to do with the details, and I just don't think we have enough information at this point.
John McDonald:
Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks, John.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Okay. So I just one follow-up to the last question is does it impact how you're thinking about the co-brand cards you have, the rewards card, is because I think one of the media narratives here is that it would impact only revolvers. And I'm wondering if that's a view that you share, or is this an impact on the entirety of the card book?
Jeremy Barnum:
Right. Can I just look at this? There obviously, it would impact prime less than subprime. It would be traumatic on subprime. And some of those co-brands are a lot of subprime, etcetera. So you really have to go co-brand by co-brand. But you would have to adjust your model for the added risk by this and ongoing price controls and things like that. So you know, if it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic. You know, if it happens in a way which modified quite a bit, it would be less.
Betsy Graseck:
And we don't know the number yet, but it would be very dramatic if it was just a cap. And then on the Apple Card, two years to bring on. Jeremy, you mentioned for good reason. Is this primarily a function of the technology that Apple Card was built on. Right? Like, so as far as I can I'm aware, the current offering had a built-for-purpose technology stack. And I understand you know, I guess my question is for you.
Are you building out a whole new technology to enable that same interface with the users of Apple Card or are you able to take are you able to enhance your current system to enable the users to come on to your current system, or is it under a whole new tech stack? And or are there other reasons why it's a two-year process?
Jeremy Barnum:
There are no other reasons. It is if it was a traditional credit card thing, we can fold it in rather quickly and just put it in our systems. But it's not. They actually built a completely different integrated into iOS tech stack, and they did a good job. So it's good stuff. But to but we have to integrate that inside our system. System. And to do that, it's gonna take two years and cost a bit of money to meet the terms and standards. Those terms and standards are actually quite good. We looked at them and said, no. That's good. They Apple wants to take very good care of those customers.
And a lot of those things will be built directly into our system we could obviously apply some of that customer service stuff in other places. And we wanna do it right. And that's all it is. We have to rebuild what their tech stack is, embedded into our system.
Betsy Graseck:
Excellent. Thank you.
Jeremy Barnum:
Thanks, Betsy.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.
Erika Najarian:
Hi, good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, investors were feeling quite optimistic about the fundamental macro opportunities for the banks in 2026, paired with deregulation, of course. And I think this weekend sort of shook their confidence given the, you know, social media post, by about credit card rate caps and, of course, additionally, the DOJ subpoenas to chair Powell. And, you know, investors kept saying over the weekend, we can't wait till hear what Jamie has to say about the 2026 outlook. So if you could start there in terms of how you're seeing the macro backdrop unveil in 2026 for the banking industry.
And how you're considering, the risks, whether it's executive overreach or the geopolitical, situation at the moment.
Jamie Dimon:
Yeah. So I mean, I'll answer the question, but I think when you're guessing of what the macro environment is gonna be, if you ask me, in the short run, call it six months and nine months and even a year, you know, that's pretty positive. You know? Consumers have money. There's still jobs even though it's weakened a little bit. There's a huge there is a lot of stimulus coming from one big beautiful bill. Deregulation is a plus in general, not just for banks, you know, but they banks will be able to redeploy capital. But the backdrop is also important, but the time tables are different. Geopolitical is an enormous amount of risk.
I don't have to go through each part of it. It's just a big matter of risk that may or may not be determined the state of the economy. You know, the deficits in The United States and around the world are quite large. We don't know that's gonna bite. It will bite eventually because you can't just keep on borrowing money endlessly. And so you know, early on fine, you know, who knows? And so and, you know, of course, we have to deal with the world we got. Not the world we want. And, you know, I've never you know, we don't guess about the outcome. We serve clients.
Serve them left and right, and we'll deal and navigate you know, with the politics and the issues that we have to deal with you know, around the world and stuff like that, and we're comfortable we can build our business. I do think if you look at things, you know, the rising tide is lifting all boats a little bit. I'm quite conscious of that. And how I look at the numbers at least. But it doesn't mean it's not gonna it does not mean it's gonna stop this year.
Erika Najarian:
Got it. And my follow-up question is for you, Jeremy. Underneath the $95 billion of NII ex markets for the year. Could you give us a sense of what kind of balance sheet growth you think, is underpinning that? And maybe some commentary on how you're thinking about you know, deposit growth in, you know, two thousand and twenty-six relative to your earlier commentary about yield-seeking flows. And how those statistics would compare to balance sheet growth of 8% in '25 and average deposit growth of 5% in '25.
Jeremy Barnum:
Sure. So, I mean, not to be pedantic here, Erica, but I'm gonna pivot away from balance sheet growth per se and just talk about, you know, loans and deposits recognizing that you know, some non-trivial portion of balance sheet growth is coming from inside of markets these days. And the name on that stuff is you know, variable and also not part of the NIIX markets. But taking a step back in terms of the big sort of balance sheet drivers and know, growth and mix drivers of the NII. Number one, you know, as the slide says and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, card, card loan growth is still a driver.
You know, I think we're expecting something like six or 7% car loan growth for 2026. So that is lower than we've seen recently, obviously, but we've been talking about that for some time. As a function of the normalization of the revolver account. So that as tailwind is largely behind us, and what we have now is just growth from overall system growth and consumer balance sheet growth as well as our optimism about share and client engagement, customer engagement across the card ecosystem. So that's one important loan driver. On the deposit side, you know, starting with wholesale, 2025 was an exceptionally strong year for wholesale deposit growth.
So as we look to '26, we're still pretty optimistic about the wholesale deposit franchise and the payments franchise know, products, offerings, customer engagement, growth opportunities, etcetera, but it's gonna be tough to beat. The 2025 performance in wholesale deposit growth. So we have a more modest for 2026 wholesale deposit growth.
And then I touched a little bit on what we're thinking about consumer deposit growth earlier, but just to reiterate, you know, the narrative there is the balance between what is very robust engagement and franchise success manifested through the 1.7 million new accounts that were originated this year, and the fact that the balances per account are sort of not growing quite as fast as we thought earlier in the year. As a function of yield-seeking flows, that are much, much lower than they were at the peak but are still not exactly zero. So there's a kind of tension between those two things.
And at this point, we're sort of expecting that inflection in balance per account to kick in the 2026, at which point you would start to see kind of a reassertion of the consumer deposit growth, which would get us to you know, modest deposit growth for CCB in 2026, but certainly lower than that 6% scenario that we talked about at Investor Day, which is stuff we already told you about last quarter and that Mary Anne has discussed.
Jamie Dimon:
Can you just ask one more can you add one more factor? Which the Fed you know, they don't call it QE. But they're talking about doing $40 billion a month of buying t bills. That adds $40 billion a month into bank all things being equal to bank reserves. And most of that initially shows up in wholesale deposits. And then, you know, maybe gets redeployed. So we'll see how that plays out too. But it does create more liquidity in the system which I should have mentioned as another tailwind for you know, No. That's exactly right.
And I think in our in our sort of crude framework, we, as Jamie says, would initially tend to assume that growth in system-wide deposits would accrue to extremely high beta wholesale deposits and is therefore not gonna tend to be a big driver of the NII story year on year. But it's significant in terms of the system and the functioning line.
Erika Najarian:
Does that conclude your question, Erica?
Erika Najarian:
Yes. Thank you. Yes. Thank you.
Jeremy Barnum:
Thanks, Erica.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Gerard Cassidy:
Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jimmy. Jeremy, thank you for the you for the data around the MBFI portfolio. Can you share with us an expansion you talked about the growth over this last seven years has been significant. And the drivers of the growth are, you know, the market dynamics and regulatory pressures. Can you expand upon that to give us a little more color of, know, what's behind that?
Jamie Dimon:
Yeah. Oh, you wanna take that? Go ahead, Jamie. Well, I'd look. Look. We it is. We obviously do things that we think are safe and proper and stuff like that. But it is arbitrage. We participate in that. We're better from regulatory capital holding know, AAA piece of something on top of something else. As opposed to doing the direct loan itself. That's what it is. It's also arbitrage between banks and insurance guys and stuff like that. And that has been some of that growth. Of the things I would tell the regulators is when you see arbitrage, it should you should look at it.
I always ask the question why and ask you're better off doing it that way as opposed to another way. Yeah. Exactly. There's nothing mystical about the loans that all these MBFIs are making. This stuff has been going for a long period of time. It's just bigger now.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yeah. Exactly. On the point of nothing mystical, my version of that, Gerard, and part of the reason that I chose those words in the prepared remarks is to ask the question, well, like, what's the narrative here if you go back in terms of regulation and you know, competitive dynamics with the private credit ecosystem in particular and what has led to what and how is that all evolved. And I think you know, it's well understood that in addition to the regulatory capital factors, were also the leverage lending guidelines, which really did meaningfully constrain bank lending into this type of space. When those were released.
And I there's an argument to say that seeded or accelerated the growth of this ecosystem in ways that otherwise might not have happened. But at some level, that is what it is. And I think as we've been talking about for the last couple years, there's no reason that we can't compete head to head in that space. So the whole, you know, direct lending initiative and the realization that in many cases, what sponsors want is, like, a quick execution of a unitranche structure where they don't have to negotiate with a syndicate. But other times, they wanna go through the syndication process.
And that's why we really leaned in to this whole product agnostic strategy that we talked about. And at the same time, in the cases where we don't wind up being the lender, yeah, sometimes we're competing with these folks. Sometimes they're our clients. Sometimes they're both. And, you know, done properly, as we talk about on the slide, we're very happy, you know, to be to be lenders to them. So it's all part of a you know, competitive partner ecosystem, and you know, yeah, we just wanted to frame it out a little bit given all the questions last quarter. No. That was very helpful. Appreciate it.
And as a follow-up question, you guys obviously have given us the guidance for NII with and without markets. And when you go back to the markets number in 2024, I think you guys put up about a billion dollars in revenues. You show us '25 at 3.3 in market conditions, of course, that will impact your guidance on the $8 billion. But what's the strategy of growing that business from where it was in 'twenty-four to where we are today? Yeah. Good question. So a couple of things about this. So number one, broadly speaking, over short periods of time, that markets and AI number is gonna fluctuate primarily as a function of rates. And is liability sensitive.
So in other words, at higher rates, the number is lower. So what we saw if you sort of and we would we show the number every quarter. If you plot the evolution of that number as function of the policy rate, you're gonna see that relationship very strongly. It's also true, I pointed out in different moments, that probably the reason that we deemphasize it is that if there are particular mix changes in any given moment, know, Brazilian futures versus cash or something, you know, high-interest rate countries, you can get pretty big swings in the number in ways that have essentially no bottom line impact. Which is the reason we deemphasize the change.
But third piece, is just that you know, as has been noted, the market's balance sheet has grown a lot. Over time. And so as we extend more financing to clients, the size of this effect gets bigger. Which is all the more reason that we find it useful to carve it out and make it clear that in general, short-term fluctuations don't have any bottom line impact. And Jamie wanted to something. Yes. We don't run the business at all trying to grow NII in particular because we just look at the revenues created by the trade. Sometimes NII, sometimes it's a net revenue. But growing the business is important.
We have you know, the best FIC business in the world, one of the best equity business in the world. Have extraordinary people around the world. We grow the business by building technology adding research, adding cells, sales know, doing a better job in parts of the world where we don't have a great share, but someone else is doing better than us. So we're gonna grow that business. We're quite good at it. It's critical to the capital markets of the world. And, you know, the capital markets of the world are gonna grow. Dramatically. Over the next twenty years. So, you know, we're that's that's how we build a business. NII is just an outcome.
On itself, almost irrelevant.
Gerard Cassidy:
Very good. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Mike Mayo:
Hi. I think I get it. JPMorgan spends for growth. You're getting growth. Up 7% year over year in the fourth quarter, and you're willing to sacrifice returns for more growth. I guess, because that increases SBA. But like, it is a wow the $9 billion increase in expenses, your guide year over year. And I get it. That some of that is simply because revenues are likely to come in higher than expected. But if we could please have some more details on the rest, this is the first time we have a chance to address that $9 billion increase in expense guide. So maybe some areas.
Jeremy, as far as tech spending, I think went up $17 billion to $18 billion last year. Went up even more after you include the savings that you achieved and especially since you're past peak modernization. Where do you expect Textpend to be in 2026? And as it relates to AI, what was your spend last year, and where do you expect that to go, and what sort of payoffs? And then, Jamie, since you're upping the bar, upping the stakes with the $9 billion of investments, the degree of your confidence that you're going to get the desired returns and outcomes from that. Thank you.
Jamie Dimon:
So can I just we're not going to give Mike, we owe you all as shareholders as much information we can give you? But we're not going to give you information which I think puts us at a competitive disadvantage. So we've been quite with you guys. First of we try to put everything in there. Everything. So even the Apple spending was in there. Inflation is in there. The expectation that revenue might go up is in there. So if revenue don't go up, that number won't be as big. You know? And but for the most part and tech is gonna go up.
We but the good news is when we look at the world, we see huge opportunity. And we're opening rural branches, which we think will be good. We're opening more branches in foreign countries. We're building better payment systems. We're adding better personalization in consumer banking credit card. We're adding AI across the company, and those are all opportunities. You know? And I understand your issue of concern about the $9 billion, but I think you should be saying if you really believe that they're real, you know, you should be doing that. That's the right way to grow a company.
And you look at the complexity of the world, the amount of capital requirements, the our SRI initiative, I think that SRI initiative you know, may be far bigger than we thought. You know? And that's in there. So you know, we're gonna we'll you'll be justified by the results, but we're not gonna be giving, you know, detail on every single thing, every single quarter. And you got to just part of to trust me. I'm sorry.
Mike Mayo:
Alright. Well, I guess I could probably just leave it there. I do have a couple, a little bit more color if you want, Mike. I would also point out we do have company updates. Coming, so that's an opportunity to talk in a bit more detail on this. I do think we highlighted you know, the vast majority of the major thematic drivers on the page subject to Jamie's caveat about not giving away too much competitive information. Maybe I'll just do one minute of, like, a little bit of additional context. I think one thing that's notable is that we did do a big kind of living within our means thing last year, and we did that.
And we're gonna continue to do that. So I think as a company, we still, generally speaking, want to make sure that when someone needs to get something done, whether it's in technology or elsewhere, their first reaction is not hire more people. Having said that, you know, the process of you know, emphasizing that a little bit more last year did give us some confidence that, you know, we were actually using resources optimally. And now as we look ahead, a lot that we wanna get done. There's a lot that we need to get done. The Apple Card is part of that, but there's other stuff too.
And so at the margin, we are allowing ourselves to at least plan for some additional hiring and technology in order to support what Jamie's saying, like the long-term investment initiative, in particular, in the businesses. Where we need to, develop prod develop and deliver products and features. And, yeah, AI is a little bit of that. But there are other things too. There's maybe one other thing I would say, which I don't think is competitively sensitive and is important, which is that you know, if you think about what's happened to the headcount of a company over, say, the last five or six years, it's grown a lot. And that happened during an obviously complicated period.
There was the whole return to the office. Hot desking, remote work, all this stuff. The end result of that is that the amount of real estate square footage over that period grew a lot more slowly than the headcount. At the same time, as we've decided as a company to be an in-office company, we realized it's obviously the case that we need to provide employees a reasonable in-office experience. And that, in some cases, means a little bit of dedensification and catching up on some space renovations around the world. Now we're not just talking about Midtown Manhattan here. For all of our 320,000 employees, they were a little bit overdue.
So I would call that a little bit of catch up to the headcount. Jeremy, don't scare them. It's not a big driver the call. Small number. It's a small number. Okay. But I think it's thematically Health care is three hundred million dollars. You know? And I just you can go item by item, but everyone's gonna have health care in place. Inflation. Real estate's a very small number, so we shouldn't bounce Yeah. I don't wanna overemphasize it. I just thought it was. Thematically interesting and not, I would say, competitively sensitive. So that's what we got. We may give you a bit more color. That company update. Alright. Well, if I could just yeah.
I guess, as you know, for any analyst, it's trust but verify. Right? So if I could just try one follow-up, just bloody think about your tech spending? Or AI spending for 2026?
Jamie Dimon:
It'll it's gonna go up a bit, but know, Mike, we have we're building more payment systems. We're building more AI systems. We're building more we're connecting more branches, which means you have the higher network expenses. You know, we're doing all the things you want us to do, You know? But the tech spend is always one of the harder ones to measure and evaluate. That's been true my whole life. You can imagine we're pretty detailed out of what we're doing, why we're doing it, are we delivering it on time, But there isn't an area where you if you dug into it, that you wouldn't say, yeah.
You wanna be you better be the best in the world in tech. But we spend money on trading. We spend money on payments. We spend money on We spend money at asset management. We spend money in corporate. We spend my we need to have the best tech in the world. That drives investment. It drives margin. It drives competition. A lot of it is consumer-facing, digital, personalization, travel, offers, all these things. We think are wonderful things. And I like the fact that we have these organic opportunities.
I'm I think it's something I'm looking at and saying, I'm looking at and saying it's a good thing that I can point out that we have in every single area, in every single part of the company, we can grow. In some areas, it's like trench warfare. Think of, you know, certain trading. And investment banking. In other areas, we're kinda out front, and we wanna build the next generation of technology. But you know, investment the thing about you've heard me talk about this before. A lot of businesses, you build a new plant, you capitalize it, and then you expense it over to twenty years. A lot of our business, everything gets expensed up front.
It doesn't mean it isn't a good return.
Mike Mayo:
And you're studying more AI?
Jamie Dimon:
We will be setting more in a we will I think that AI we will be spending more, but it is not a big driver I do think it'll be driving more efficiency down the road. I also point out about that. You know, efficiency because other banks have to do it too, will eventually be passed on to the customer. This is like, you know, you're gonna build three points of margin and get to keep it. You don't. So you need to you need to build some of these things just to keep up. And, you know, we have Thank you.
You know, we look at we and we look at all of our competitors, but those competitors include all the fintech. You have Stripe. You have SoFi. You have Revolut. You have you know, you have Schwab. You have everyone out there, and these are good players. And we analyze what they do and how they do it. I would stay up front. And we are going to stay up front so help us God. We're not gonna try to meet some expense target. And then, you know, ten years from now, you'd asking us the question, how did JPMorgan get left behind?
Mike Mayo:
Alright. Thanks. You're welcome. Thanks, Mike.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Ebrahim Poonawala:
Hey, good morning. I guess maybe, Jeremy, quick one to a follow-up on this whole credit card interest rates. I think you said understandably, this would be very bad for the credit card industry. And JPMorgan. Given that the president put out a timeline for Jan twentieth. Is it fair for us to conclude there's been no communication from the administration to the banks or the industry on how they plan to implement this, and are you expecting anything over the coming days?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yeah. I guess I just this has happened so quickly, and there's just so little flow of information, at least that I'm aware of, that I just think it's better to not answer those questions. I mean, it's entirely possible that in the last twelve hours, someone spoken to someone. I don't know. But this is happening very quickly in a sort of unconventional way starting with a you know, social media post. So I understand why you're asking the question, but I just don't have anything for you.
Ebrahim Poonawala:
Got it. And just very quickly on capital, when we think about more updates coming on GSA, Basel and game probably over the coming months. When you think about the right level of capital, just in your seat, do you think two, 300 basis points of excess capital wherever the regulatory minimum shakes out is the right place to be given all the, risk that Jamie talked about, geopolitics, competitive landscape, etcetera? Or do you have a view on where in a perfect world you would want to operate the bank relative to where capital requirements shook out?
Jeremy Barnum:
Okay. So I wanna be very precise in my answer to your question here, and there are a few pieces to it. So let's start first with the fact that rules aren't done yet, and there are some things that are still out there. And then there's pro you know, periodically reference to a discussion about the right level of capital for banks or for the system. And our answer to that, which we said frequently, but I'll just say it again, is that the answer to that question is do every part of the methodology, across RWA G SIB, and stress testing correctly supported by data to get the right answer for that individual thing.
And whatever the sum of those things is, for the system, for any individual bank is what it is. And it should very much not be a sort of goal-seeking exercise or some arbitrary number at the level of the system or for large banks or for small banks and certainly not for any given firm. I think the good news is that from what we're hearing and from what we understand, that is in fact the direction of travel from the agencies, and so that's encouraging. Let's see what happens.
But you know, in that context, obvious example that we always talk about, but it's really just worth saying out loud again, is G SIB where, you know, at some point, you really have to ask yourself, you know, what is the right difference between the amount of capital that we should be required to hold and, for example, a very large American regional bank, especially given the enormous amount of progress that's been made over the last ten or fifteen years on resolvability and all other aspects of the framework. So, I won't give you the long speech about why g SID is completely poorly conceived.
Hopefully, that gets adjusted in a way that's reasonable, but should be done correctly.
Jamie Dimon:
Wanna jump in, Jay? Hey. Look. We'd end up with $30.40, or more billions of dollars of excess capital. Yeah. We have tons of capital. There's no scenario where capital is gonna be the issue. I think it's very important that you gotta look across the full spectrum of capital, liquidity, stress testing, and all these things about what can you do to make the system safer. For a lot of these banks, it's not capital You know? It's interest rate exposure or it's liquidity or it's resolution-related type of stuff.
And so I think there's overly focused in capital and so you're gonna get to see as people respond to all the Fed you know, APRs they put out, whatever the NPRs they put out, know, what people think about capital. But I actually believe and this is the important fact, that you could make the system with less capital change liquidity, and make it safer. That's what we should be focusing on. Make it as safer so that you all don't have to worry about bank failures. And it isn't just capital.
Jeremy Barnum:
Yeah. Very much so. Do want to go back and answer your actual question. Does for the avoidance of doubt because you talked about kind of the right level of capital for us and where we wanna run the company, and you referred to, like, a few 100 basis points. And I think there, it's very important to draw the distinction between what we think is the right amount of excess capital for us to carry now given the risk that we see now in the short to medium term, We obviously have a lot of access right now relative to basically any version of final rules.
And, you know, that feels more appropriate than ever, I would argue, given, you know, what we see out there in terms of the risks and potential opportunities to deploy in the event of a disruption. There's another version of your question which is implicitly a question about long-term buffers, and I that's what I'm sort of wanna steer away from because in the end, like, we're gonna run the company at the right level of capital and capital requirements are requirements. There's a larger discussion about buffer usability. So I'm I just wanna not leave any doubt about a sort of implicit 300 basis point management buffer, which is very much not the way we're thinking about that.
There should be no buffers. And the fact is these capital numbers are already set to handle maximum stress. That's how they're set.
Ebrahim Poonawala:
That was very comprehensive. Thank you both.
Jeremy Barnum:
Thanks, Ibrahim.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.
Jim Mitchell:
I just want ask about loan growth. Jeremy, as you pointed out, a lot of the growth has been driven by NDF and cards. But we've seen three rate cuts in September. We have a few more expected. Deregulation is beginning to have an impact in areas like leverage lending, with more to come. So are you seeing any sort of I guess, number one, are you seeing any early signs of a broadening out of demand across other categories like traditional C and I mortgage, or auto? And what are your expectations for '26?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yeah, Jim. So things about that. You know, I did actually hear that it was a pretty busy day. The home lending business on the back of, what happened in the mortgage market. So you know, maybe we'll actually start to see some pick up there. But, you know, obviously, there are still some larger dynamics in the housing market. That will be a challenge there. So at a high level, when we look out to 2026, I still think that for CCB, know, the story is really about card.
I think in wholesale, if you set aside sort of markets lending for the sake of argument, I actually think we have a what I would describe as a moderately optimistic outlook for loan growth in terms of traditional C and I. And CC and CIB. Now obviously, you don't need to hear my speech about how NCIB you know, C and I lending is an output, not an input. It's kind of a loss leader or whatever. But still, it does give you some indication of the level of client engagement and optimism maybe in c suites.
And I think the way that outlook of ours is built up for sort of like modest C and I loan growth outside of markets is a combination of the generally optimistic outlook for frankly, the global corporate environment as a whole as well as some optimism about our growth and expansion strategies, and that's space, are significant and is one of the areas in which we're investing. And, of course, as we acquire new clients, while we don't acquire them for the sake of lending, the new clients often come with loans, and that's very much part of the strategy. So I would say broadly, nothing that dramatic.
As a function of the lower rate environment in particular, but you know, a modestly optimistic outlook.
Jim Mitchell:
Okay. And maybe just a follow-up on credit. You had some more charge-offs this quarter that seemed a little elevated. But NPAs came down in commercial. So just trying to think what's your view there? Do you feel like with rates coming down and the outlook pretty solid, do you feel like, still steady Eddie? Any improvement or any concerns out there on the corporate credit side?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yes. Good question. I guess a couple of nuances there. So the charge-offs this quarter were largely already provisioned actually, which is part of the reason that we sort of explained the wholesale credit cost narrative through the lens of the net provisions. If you do charge-offs and allowance, it's a little bit nonintuitive. But when you do that and you look at the drivers of the provision, I think it's fair to say that at the margin, and it's a very small margin, I would point out, but it's more negative than positive, meaning downgrades are exceeding upgrades. By a little bit.
And we did make some, you know, parameter updates to assume slightly higher loss given default, in the wholesale lending portfolio, which drove a little bit of an increase in the allowance. I don't wanna make too big a deal out of that stuff. It's pretty small in this scheme of things, and I definitely would not say we're saying anything concerning in a broader sense. And, also, it's worth noting that when it comes to wholesale charge-offs, you know, the numbers have been running at exceptionally low levels for a long time. As the portfolio has also grown. So simply bringing that back to slightly more normal through cycle charge-off rates would still involve some increase in charge-offs.
So in other words, it's a wholesale version of the whole, like, normalization versus deterioration story that we were talking a lot. About in card as the cycle normalized. With the caveat being, of course, that in wholesale, tend to be a lot more lumpy. And, you know, any given moment, you don't know whether something is idiosyncratic or the a sign of a larger trend. But at a high level, I would say nothing that concerning. And it's not particularly in my mind, driven by rate one way or the other.
Jim Mitchell:
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Jeremy Barnum:
Thanks. By the way, we lost Jamie. He had to go to another meeting, but you still have me for any remaining questions.
Operator:
Thank you. Our last question will come from Chris McGratty with KBW. Your line is open.
Chris McGratty:
Great. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jeremy, my question is on consumer deposit competition. As rates come down, and we talked about loan growth showing some signs of life. I'm interested in your thoughts on incremental competition by market, product, peer, more or less competitive. Anything you could add?
Jeremy Barnum:
I mean, space is always very competitive, I would say. Has been, you know, throughout this entire cycle. I wouldn't I haven't heard anything recently to change that narrative one way or the other. You know? I mean, I think the larger point, of course, is that all else being equal, with a lower policy rate, you would expect yield-seeking flows to abate even further. Again, they're already at very low levels, but as we discussed previously when talking about consumer deposit outlook, there's currently a little bit of this sort of standoff between those low level of yield-seeking flows. And the pending return to growth of deposits per account.
And one thing that you might expect all on SQL is that when the headline policy rate drops, it incrementally decreases the amount of yield-seeking flow pressure. Aside, obviously, from the direct translation into lower CD rates, which is just straightforward. But at a high level, I would say I haven't really heard anything interesting or new beyond the background ever-present factor of a very competitive marketplace?
Chris McGratty:
Great. Thank you. And then a follow-up on AWM, the flows and margins. Remain very, very good. Interested in your thoughts about sustainability and opportunities for the pieces of growth in the medium term?
Jeremy Barnum:
Yeah. I mean, AWM is one of the businesses where we're investing. I think we've been optimistic there for a long time. We've been investing there for a long time. We've had a bunch of, you know, product innovation in the asset management space. That's worked out very well and led to AUM growth. And, yeah, I mean, specifically, you know, hiring advisers. And bankers, in the private bank has been a source of you know, it's been very successful, and we're continuing to lean in there quite aggressively. So our franchise is doing great. Flows have been exceptional. And it's one of our areas of optimism for the future.
Chris McGratty:
Great. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. We have no further questions.
Jeremy Barnum:
Okay. Very much everyone. See you next quarter.

Chief Executive Officer
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge last night's tragic air collision in Washington, D.C. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this terrible event, particularly the families and friends of the victims.
Turning now to our results. We had a strong start to our fiscal year with $9.5 billion in net revenue, up 10% year over year, and EPS up 14%. Our key business drivers improved from the fourth quarter. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 9% year over year.
U.S. payments volume grew 7% and international payments volume grew 11%. Cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, rose 16% in constant dollars, and processed transactions grew 11% year over year. Our strategy across consumer payments, new flows, and value-added services continues to resonate with our clients and is reflected in our business results.
Back in February 2020, when we articulated our strategy, our total first-quarter volume on our network had just crossed $3 trillion. Just five years later, our total quarterly volume was above $4 trillion. At the same time, CEMEA and Latin America had more volume from people using their cards to get cash than to make payments. Five years later, as a result of double-digit constant dollar payments volume growth in both regions, the situation has flipped, and we now have more than 60% of our volume from digital payments.
I'm looking forward to our Investor Day next month to discuss our strategy and our plans for future growth. For now, let's look at some of the quarterly highlights that have helped to deliver this impressive progress. In consumer payments, we now have 4.7 billion credentials, up 7% year over year, and 12.6 billion tokens, up 44% year over year. We continue to grow our credentials in an increasingly digital world.
Interest in our Visa flexible credential continues to grow. We have now launched with the Affirm card in the U.S., expanded the funding options with SMCC in Japan by adding small business cards, and announced a multicurrency solution with fintech Liv in the U.A.E. Tap to add card is now live in the U.S. for nearly 60% of all Visa consumer credit and debit cards.
Since the launch, millions have added their cards to their wallets by tapping, eliminating the overwhelming majority of provisioning fraud as compared to manual entry into a phone. And 74% of all face-to-face transactions are now tap to pay. A few countries I would like to call out, Japan, where tap-to-pay penetration grew 20 percentage points since last year to 44%; Argentina, where tap-to-pay penetration was up 22 percentage points to 78%; and the U.S., where it was up 13 percentage points to 57%. Several key initiatives contributed to the growth in these countries, including targeted marketing campaigns, the launch of transit acceptance in certain cities, and increased issuance of tap-to-pay-enabled credentials.
Finally, tap to phone is now live in 118 markets. And in the last year, the number of phones enabled has more than doubled and the number of transactions has more than tripled. Now, let me turn to a few deal highlights from across the globe. First, in Mainland China, we renewed our partnership with ICBC, the largest bank in the world in terms of assets and the biggest credit card issuer in Mainland China in terms of number of cards.
In India, we renewed our long-standing credit agreements with ICICI Bank, SBI Card, and Kotak Mahindra Bank, three of our largest issuers in the country with a focus on growing affluent and cross-border volume. We also renewed our debit agreement with Kotak Mahindra Bank. Also, in our Asia Pacific region, we signed a long-term renewal with Bank of New Zealand, one of the largest banks in the country across consumer debit, consumer credit, and business credit. In Argentina and Uruguay, we renewed our portfolios with Santander for a long-term agreement with a focus on growing affluent.
Also in Latin America, we have deepened our partnership with BAC to grow acceptance with a goal to enable 300,000 nano and small merchants and to grow in new verticals. We also won the issuance of their largely cross-border credit portfolio, Millas Plus, offering our expertise and value-added services. Similarly, in Brazil, we extended our partnership with digital bank Neon, which includes the launch of a new credit portfolio. We are also pleased to have renewed a pan-European agreement with BNP Paribas, which also includes the winning of additional portfolios in France and Belgium.
When we talk about the total addressable opportunity in consumer payments, we often talk about the opportunity to win share from domestic networks, and we are continuing to have success converting credentials from domestic networks to Visa. In Bangladesh, we secured nearly 6 million credentials with Dutch Bangla Bank from their closed-loop system. And Banco Popular Puerto Rico, the largest issuer and acquirer in Puerto Rico, renewed a multiyear credit and debit partnership with Visa that aims to expand digital penetration in the country through the launch of new products, including a co-badge card with the local network. And we've renewed our business with RBC Royal Bank in 10 countries across the Caribbean, and we also expanded our relationship to include the transfer of debit credentials in the Dutch Caribbean to Visa and are supporting the development of new credit and commercial products.
And co-brand cards remain a key area of strength for us, and this quarter was no exception. In India, we launched two very important cards. First, the Times Black ICICI Bank credit card, catering to high-net-worth individuals with travel and lifestyle benefits. Second, the HSBC Taj credit card, India's first premium co-branded hospitality credit card.
In our CEMEA region, we signed with real estate developer, investor, and manager, Aldar for a co-brand card for its Darna Rewards by Aldar loyalty program in the U.A.E. with issuing bank Emirates NBD. We also launched a new co-brand card in Saudi Arabia with Alrajhi Bank and Marriott Bonvoy, the global travel program by Marriott International. In the airline category, we won the portfolio for EGYPTAIR, Africa's second-largest airline.
We also expanded our business in the SWISS card Miles & More program. And in the retail segment, we signed with Casas Bahia, one of the top retailers in Brazil for co-brand cards; and with Volt, a leading ride-hailing and food delivery operator in Ukraine. So, through traditional issuance, winning share from domestic networks, and leveraging our brand products and innovation to secure important co-brands, our consumer payments business is strong. Now, to new flows, where revenue grew 19% year over year in constant dollars.
Visa Direct has now crossed the $10 billion transaction mark over the last 12 months with nearly 3 billion transactions this quarter. We continue to expand Visa Direct in several ways, one of which is building and deepening partnerships directly with issuers and fintechs. We are excited to partner with X Money for their much-anticipated launch of the X Money account, including P2P payment functionality set for later this year. Through the partnership, X Money will utilize Visa Direct to enable secure and instant funding of their X wallet with a user's debit card.
Users will also have the option to instantly transfer funds back into their bank account via the same debit card. This quarter, we signed an agreement with OnePay, a fintech company with more than 3 million monthly active users for Visa Direct as the engine for wallet loads. In Ecuador, Banco Pichincha, one of the country's largest issuers, will begin using Visa Direct for cross-border remittance payments. Our broad and deep cross-border capabilities continue to be important differentiators.
And this quarter, Libra Internet Bank in Romania launched a real-time multicurrency FX service for their business customers utilizing our Currencycloud solution. In Asia Pacific, OCBC has launched a cross-border P2P solution on the OCBC app, allowing their customers in Singapore to send money to Chinese wallets using Visa Direct. All they need is the recipient's China national ID name and mobile number. Now, moving to Commercial, where volumes were up 6% year over year this quarter in constant dollars.
We had some notable progress in specific verticals. First, in the food and grocery delivery vertical, we had two recent wins. In the U.S., we are pleased that DoorDash's shopper card program will soon be using Visa virtual commercial credit cards to enable Dashers to pay for customer orders at physical merchant outlets. This is in addition to our Visa Direct relationship with DoorDash in the U.S., Australia, and Canada to enable Dasher payouts.
In Brazil, we signed a commercial business card deal for commercial customers of iFood Pago, the fintech for the largest food delivery platform in the country. In the healthcare vertical, we reached a virtual card agreement with an insurtech company in France, mySofie, offering medical policyholders an easy way to pay for their healthcare. In the T&E vertical, we recently renewed and deepened our partnership with Airwallex, a global financial platform enabling more than 150,000 businesses to manage payments and money movement across borders. Today, Visa and Airwallex have live card programs in Australia, Hong Kong, the U.K., United States, Canada, Netherlands, and Singapore to enable businesses to easily make digital card payments around the world.
And soon, we will be expanding to new geographies across our use cases in expense cards and B2B travel. In both Visa Direct and Commercial, we continued to develop innovative new solutions and use cases that helped us retain and secure business. Now, to value-added services, where in the first quarter, revenue grew 18% in constant dollars. Across our solutions, we continue to grow revenue as we enhance Visa payments, enable services for all types of payments, and go beyond payments.
We often partner with acquirers who utilize Visa's Acceptance Platform to offer their merchant clients compelling solutions. When this happens, we generate revenue on both Visa and non-Visa transactions. Three examples this quarter are European acquirer emerchantpay, Guatemalan acquirer NeoNet, and Paraguayan acquirer Bancard, who will all offer CyberSource to their merchants. We are also partnering with Fiserv to include our CyberSource gateway as a solution for their acquirers and merchants in Europe and Asia Pacific.
This is in addition to Fiserv expanding their use of cardholder authentication from CardinalCommerce to further extend our global partnership into additional Fiserv platforms. In our risk solutions, in 2024, we launched Visa Protect for A2A payments with plans to expand to 10 new RTP networks in 2025. Powered by AI-based fraud detection models, this new service provides a real-time risk score that can be used to identify fraud on account-to-account payments. We are now piloting the solution with five significant players in Brazil, who represent more than 20% of Pix transactions.
We are also very pleased to have closed our acquisition of Featurespace, enabling us to provide an expanded set of fraud prevention tools to our clients and protect consumers in real time across various payment methods. In advisory services, we continue to see strong demand. One example of a recent project is with Alrajhi Bank, where we are expanding our advisory relationship into risk, digital enablement, and data analysis across their portfolios. So, across our value-added services portfolio, we are innovating with new solutions and deepening our partnerships with clients to drive growth.
To wrap it up, we began our fiscal year with strong performance, an ever-growing obsession for our clients, and a focus on continued innovation as we build the future of payments. I look forward to seeing you in February at our Investor Day. And now, over to Chris.

Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflected improving underlying drivers and effective execution of our business. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year over year; and cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, was up 16% year over year.
Processed transactions grew 11% year over year. Fiscal first-quarter net revenue was up 10%, higher than our expectations, primarily due to strong international transaction revenue and value-added services revenue. Net revenue was up 11% in constant dollars. EPS was up 14% year over year and 15% in constant dollars, higher than expected, primarily due to revenue outperformance and a lower-than-expected tax rate.
Now, let's go into the details. In the U.S., total payments volume grew 7% year over year, up two points from Q4. Credit grew 7% and debit grew 8%. The U.S.
benefited from a strong holiday shopping season, which is the period from November 1 to December 31, and the lapping of the impact of Reg II implementations, which had a modest drag in Q1 of last year. In the U.S., consumer holiday spending growth was in the upper mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. The consumer categories with the strongest growth were discretionary categories such as retail, travel, and entertainment. Focusing on retail, holiday spending growth was a couple of points higher than last year and retail spending growth on key shopping days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday was several points higher.
E-commerce was a higher share of retail holiday spending versus last year. In key countries around the globe, we saw similar trends, with consumer retail holiday spending growth improving from last year. Moving to international markets. Total payments volume was up 11% in constant dollars, up from Q4.
In most of our regions, payments volume year-over-year growth rates in constant dollars were strong for the quarter, with Latin America up 22%, CEMEA up 18%, and Europe up 13%. Asia Pacific payments volume growth saw a slight improvement from Q4 in constant dollars to just above 1% year over year for the quarter, reflecting a still somewhat muted macroeconomic environment. Now, to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Total cross-border volume was up 16% year over year in Q1, three points above Q4.
E-commerce measured as card-not-present volume ex travel and cross-border travel volume were both up 16% year over year for Q1. E-commerce volumes continued to benefit from the strength in retail, in part due to the strong holiday shopping season. Travel volumes performed well across our regional corridors due to broader strength in both consumer and commercial spending. Outbound Europe and Asia Pacific travel volume growth also benefited from solid performance of client portfolios.
For the U.S., both outbound e-commerce and travel volume growth were also helped by the strong dollar. Now, let's review our first quarter financial results. I'll start with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 8% year over year versus the 8% growth in Q4 constant dollars payments volume.
Data processing revenue grew 9% versus 11% processed transaction growth due largely to the back half-loaded 2025 pricing impact that was included in our initial guidance. Had pricing been more evenly spread across the year as in the prior year, these two growth metrics would have been more in line for the first quarter. International transaction revenue was better than expected, benefiting from higher cross-border volumes and higher currency volatility than we expected. Year-over-year growth was up 14%, below the 16% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, due primarily to foreign exchange and lapping higher currency volatility from last year.
Other revenue grew 32%, primarily driven by better-than-expected consulting and marketing services growth and select pricing modifications. Client incentives grew 13%, reflecting a strong renewal quarter. Now, to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue growth was driven by improving payments volume, cross-border volume, and process transaction growth.
New flows revenue grew 19% year over year in constant dollars driven by better-than-expected commercial cross-border performance across all regions and Visa Direct transaction growth. Commercial payments volume rose 6% year over year in constant dollars, mainly driven by favorable days mix impact as well as strong cross-border volumes. Visa Direct transactions grew 34% year over year, helped by growth in Latin America for interoperability among P2P apps. Value-added services revenue grew to $2.4 billion, a growth rate of 18% in constant dollars, led by strong growth in consulting and marketing services, Issuing Solutions, and Risk and Identity Solutions.
Operating expenses grew 11%, in line with our expectations, driven by increases in personnel and general and administrative expenses. In our GAAP results, we had $213 million in severance costs related to changes to our workforce, reflecting our efforts to focus investment on the highest growth opportunities for our business as well as accelerating our innovation to better serve our clients. Our tax rate was 17.7%, better than expected due to various items, including a change in our geographic mix of earnings. EPS was $2.75, up 14% over last year, with an approximately one-point drag from exchange rates and an approximately half-point drag from acquisitions.
In Q1, we bought back approximately $3.9 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders. At the end of December, we had $9.1 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now, let's move to what we've seen so far in Q2. Through January 28, driver trends have remained strong.
U.S. payments volume was up 8%, with debit up 9% and credit up 7% year over year. Processed transactions grew 11% year over year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, we saw total volume grew 17% year over year, travel-related cross-border volume grew 17% year over year, and cross-border card-not-present ex-travel volume grew 16%.
Now, on to our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted net revenue growth to be in the high single digits to low double digits.
I would note that the primary difference between Q1 and Q2 adjusted net revenue growth is the lapping of leap year. We expect second-quarter adjusted operating expense growth to be in the high single to low double digits. Nonoperating income in the second quarter is expected to be negligible. And our tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be around 17.5%.
As a result, we expect second-quarter adjusted EPS growth to be in the high single digits. We have now closed the acquisition of Featurespace and lapped the impact of Pismo in January. For acquisition impacts, we expect a minimal impact to net revenue growth, and approximately 1.5-point contribution to operating expense growth, and an approximately half-point headwind to EPS growth in the second quarter. Now, let's cover our full-year expectations.
We now expect full-year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low double digits. There are no material changes to our adjusted operating expense growth and nonoperating income expectations for the full year. Based on our lower-than-expected tax rate in Q1 and an updated view for the rest of the year, we're lowering our expected tax rate to be between 17.5% and 18%. Taking all of this together, we now expect adjusted EPS growth to be in the low teens.
Featurespace and Pismo are expected to have a minimal impact on full-year net revenue growth and approximately one-point contribution to operating expense growth and an approximately half-point headwind to EPS growth. In summary, we're off to a strong start to the year. We remain focused on the execution of our growth strategy for the rest of 2025 and look forward to Investor Day in a few weeks. And now, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.

Hey, guys, I appreciate you taking the question. I also wanted to follow up on some of the stronger spending results that you've seen. You called out the strong results. That's been pretty evident in some of the prints so far this quarter.
I just wanted to know if there's anything kind of when you peel back the onion in some of the data that you guys have, if there's anything obvious that you would attribute this acceleration over the past couple of months toward? I know you called out some things around holiday spending. And obviously, there's been a lot of days mix things going on. But we spent, I think, a year talking about ticket size being a headwind. So, I'm wondering how much of this is sort of a new run rate and lapping kind of tougher comps over the last couple of years versus kind of an outright acceleration and kind of spending above trend.
Curious if you have any thoughts on that. Thanks.
Chris Suh
--
Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks for the question, Will. Well, let's try to break down, unpack a little bit a few things in there. We talked about strength in the U.S.
and international markets. The strength in the U.S., we did have a strong holiday. I gave some of those numbers in the prepared comments that you heard about. It also helped discretionary categories, retail, travel, and entertainment, and then the lapping of Reg II.
That was really the step-up that we saw in the U.S. We feel really good about that and then like we talked about as well across the regions. And so, from a payment volume standpoint, I feel really good about that. Cross-border, maybe the added commentary on cross-border was, if you look at e-commerce, e-commerce was up one point from Q4, cross-border e-commerce benefiting from the stronger retail and holiday.
And then travel, though, did step up by four points from Q4, and not just Q4 but maybe the last two quarters, which had been around that same level. We're seeing strong travel results across all the regions. And so, again, we feel really good about that. But all that said, it's a quarter into the year, and we're going to obviously wait to see how Q2 plays out, but we feel pretty good about the outlook into the second quarter.

Thank you. Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Darrin Peller

Guys, thanks. Just a couple, two parts to a question. But first one is really to do with the underlying trends we're going to see through the year with regard to the moving parts on some of your easier lapping given that there were some business, as you talked about, that had come off last year that lapse. How does that impact your volume trajectory in the U.S.? As the year progresses, we can think about that.
Obviously, Reg II started to help already. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on rebates incentives. I know you talked about this being the higher quarter that we were going to start the year off at. Maybe just if you could help us, was this in line with your expectations in terms of the results that we saw? Or is anything changing around timing on it? Or did it really come in as expected? Thanks again, guys.
Chris Suh
--
Chief Financial Officer
OK. Let me try to tackle all three of those things, Darrin. In terms of the full-year guide, you are recalling correctly. When we started the year, we talked about sort of the dynamics in Half 1 and Half 2 and why we anticipated growth to be accelerating throughout the course of the year.
Incentives was part of that story. As we said before, as expected, this is going to be a big year for renewals, with more than 20% of our payment volume impacted and starting really meaningfully with that renewal cycle in the first half of the year. That has occurred. You saw incentives grow 13% in Q1 versus the 6% we saw in Q4.
That will continue. We anticipate Q2 incentives growth will continue to reflect that renewal cycle. You mentioned Reg II. I think we've covered that.
We are lapping what was modest impact from a year ago. And then there are some lapping benefits from portfolio as well that are more centered toward the second half of the year as well. That all said, again, I have said it before, to the last question when Will asked, it's a quarter into the year. We reflected the Q1 upside and adjusted our Q2 outlook to reflect that, and we'll certainly talk about Half 2 as we get closer to it.

I apologize for that. I'm sorry. I wanted to ask on value-added services given the recent closure of Featurespace and I think some emphasis in Pismo. Can you talk, Ryan, has there been a philosophical change, or a change in emphasis perhaps, in Visa's value-added services initiatives? And going forward, as we think about greater opportunities in that area, should we think about Visa maybe emphasizing some more security offerings versus processing and gateway? Just trying to frame that up.
Ryan McInerney
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We continue to be very excited about the progress that we're making in value-added services across the board. There's no change in emphasis as it relates to the priority or the prioritization of kind of the areas where we've been building products and serving clients. So, we continue to be very focused on delivering solutions to merchants and acquirers, very focused on delivering solutions to issuers, very focused on delivering fraud and risk solutions broadly across the ecosystem as well as our advisory business.
I talked about some examples in my prepared remarks. We have had some great acquisitions. The way that we think about acquisitions is we're constantly kind of looking for companies around the world that we can bring into our ecosystem, accelerate their growth, accelerate our kind of products that we're bringing to our clients. And Pismo and Featurespace are two great examples of those.
In terms of Pismo, we're having real good success kind of with our sales pipeline all around the world. We're having conversations with clients that I don't think Pismo ever would have had, certainly not this early in their evolution. And the reason we're able to do that is we're bringing kind of the amazing capabilities that Pismo offers together with the deep relationships and partnerships that we have as well as kind of our long track record of delivering resilient solutions to our clients and partners. Featurespace is early, but we're already having a ton of success.
I got a ton of great client and partner feedback once we closed that acquisition. We've known Featurespace for many, many years. We partnered with them. We also competed against them.
We know their capabilities really, really well. One of the things that you're seeing from us is that we're continuing to take the amazing capabilities that we have at Visa, whether that's our fraud capabilities, our network capabilities, our processing capabilities, we're unbundling those from the Visa stack, we're enhancing them, and then we're delivering them to a broader array of clients and partners many times unrelated to Visa transactions or the VisaNet platform itself. So, we continue to focus on all those areas in value-added service. We continue to have good success, and you'll continue to see us kind of move down this kind of program of unbundling our capabilities, enhancing them, and delivering them to a much broader set of clients.

Good afternoon. So, Ryan, I want to follow up on your comments on kind of this unbundling of the capabilities and ask about Visa A2A. You talked about 10 new RTP network partnerships. What are you hearing from your issuer and merchant customers? Bill Pay is probably an obvious use case.
How should we think about the road map of use cases, monetization models, and also the dynamics vis-a-vis debit in terms of cannibalization? Thank you.
Ryan McInerney
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. You're right. Kind of this notion of unbundling our capabilities is very relevant in the value-added services space for some of the reasons that I mentioned. It's also very relevant in the consumer payment space.
And Visa account-to-account is a great example, a great example where we've unbundled kind of our brand and acceptance, our rules in terms of charge-backs, disputes, and returns and how things work, as well as kind of our risk management capabilities. We've unbundled that from the Visa stack, and now we're delivering that to our partners initially in the U.K. with Visa A2A and then more broadly across Europe and other places over time. We still are on track to launch Visa A2A in early 2025.
After we announced it, we've done what we always do, which is have a bunch of great conversations with clients and partners and regulators in the U.K. As you mentioned, the initial use case is targeted at Bill Pay. And what we found through those conversations is there's a real need. There's a real need to add the types of processes and rules and the trusted brand that we have to account-to-account payments, starting in Bill Pay, to give consumers more confidence to use it, merchants more reason and confidence to offer it.
And we're excited about it. I mean, obviously, Bill Pay in U.K. is just the start. But we think that the power of kind of taking some of these Visa capabilities into the account-to-account space is going to be a great benefit for our clients and our partners in the ecosystem.
You mentioned Visa account-to-account. It's a similar story kind of on what we've been doing in account-to-account protect, where we've taken our kind of decades of risk experience, our data, our scoring algorithms and unbundled that from kind of the Visa stack, and we're delivering that to, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're targeting up to 10 RTP networks during the course of this year. I mentioned the banks we're now working with in Brazil to reduce fraud on Pix transactions. We've had great success with Pay.UK in the U.K., reducing fraud on account-to-account transactions.
And you're going to hear a lot more from other partners and other networks around the world. These two examples are both driven by client needs. I mean, that is what drives our innovation agenda. That's what drives our product delivery agenda.
We've been hearing from clients all around the world that they're looking for Visa to help them with these types of challenges, both driving safe and secure account-to-account payments around the world. So, very excited about it, and you'll continue to hear more from us on it.

Great. Thank you. I want to dig a little bit into the mix components of the cross-border business. So, you said in the past that roughly about 60% of it is travel and the other roughly 40% is e-commerce.
And I know that evolved a little bit throughout COVID and now into the recovery period. But when we think about the e-commerce component, I believe that some of the Visa Direct-related pieces are sitting there, so whether it be the remittances that are cross-border or the marketplace payouts. I was hoping you could dig into those two or that broader bucket, if there's any rough growth rates or growth contribution or sizing. And if not, just any general comments around that aspect of the cross-border business.
Chris Suh
--
Chief Financial Officer
Thanks for the question, Tim. Yes, let's unpack that as well. We've been doing some unpacking here. In terms of e-commerce, the mix that you've shared is the mix that we've shared in terms of travel and e-commerce, with e-commerce having sustained slightly better over the last few quarters.
Obviously, this quarter, the two growth rates converged. That was good to see. And within that, Visa Direct does have a cross-border component. We talked about Visa Direct transactions growing 34%.
The cross-border portion of that is growing much faster. It's obviously a small portion of the total transactions. It's growing much faster than that. And so, we continue to appreciate that.
Visa Direct in total, the momentum is great and continues to be a really good opportunity. But yes, when you add it all together, we're seeing great growth across e-commerce and cross-border. And as you know, the yields are accretive as well.
Ryan McInerney
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The only thing I'd add is that in the very big scheme of things, with all the success we're having in cross-border Visa Direct, which is great, and we are having great success, it's still a very small portion of our cross-border transactions and payment volume around the world in the big scheme of things.

Hi. Thanks. I wanted to just follow up a little bit on the cross-border question. In the past, we've seen different periods when cryptocurrencies have done well, but that's also helped the cross-border kind of e-commerce component.
I'm wondering how much of an uplift you saw from that. And I guess, tied in with that, as we've seen kind of growth rates decelerate a little bit here in January, what's your current visibility on particularly travel? And what are you seeing around bookings there? Any color you could provide on those two things would be great. Thanks.
Chris Suh
--
Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Hi, James. Crypto, so how and where does crypto impact our business? Well, there are a few ways that crypto can show up in our underlying drivers. But typically, when we see an impact, we do see it in our cross-border e-commerce volumes.
I talked about some of the drivers of that this quarter relative to Q4. But obviously, given the recent demand and sort of activity around crypto, it is a modest benefit, I would say, to our cross-border e-commerce, but it's one of the smaller benefits, I talked about sort of the other things that impact that. And so, that's where we do see it typically.

Thank you, guys. I wanted to touch on tokenization for a minute. I think you said number of tokens were up 44% in the quarter. Obviously, a pretty robust number.
So, if you can just give us a general update on tokenization strategy and any potential timing or magnitude of actual monetization opportunity from tokenization, obviously, understanding the benefits of it from a fraud and security perspective. But just wondering if there's any direct monetization we should be thinking about.
Ryan McInerney
--
Chief Executive Officer
Happy to talk about tokens. You did get the number right, and we agree that it's significant. Let me just step back and maybe put the whole token kind of road map in perspective. Visa network tokens have been and will be one of our most important investment priorities across the company.
In many ways, we led the wave of token innovation and adoption. I think it's been about a decade since we issued the first Visa token. I remember, I think in 2020, we got to 1 billion tokens. And that was a big milestone.
But in hindsight, like we were really just approaching the beginning of the steep part of the S curve. You go back to what you said about 44% growth, so we've now got more than 12.5 billion tokens across the ecosystem. We got 8,400 issuers around the world that are issuing them in 200-plus markets around the world. And we've got a third of all Visa transactions that are now tokenized.
We did 21 billion, 22 billion token transactions in the last quarter. And as you alluded to, the adoption is proliferating because the performance improvement is meaningful. If you just look at e-commerce, on tokenized transactions, we have six percentage point higher approval rates, that is significantly higher sales for our merchant partners; and 30% reduction in fraud rates, which is good for everybody in the ecosystem. Tokens have become one of our most important platforms for enabling innovation.
For example, I think it was last quarter, I talked about in Europe, we're using tokens to simplify the e-commerce checkout experience. We've embedded FIDO passkeys via Visa tokens into click-to-pay, and we're making e-commerce checkout as easy as it is that you and I unlock our phone with our face or fingerprint. So, that's an example of tokens being a platform to drive innovation around the world. They're also a critical enabler of our value-added services.
And those, we deepen relationships with our partners, and we also grow revenue. To your question around monetization, what would be a couple of examples? We've got merchants that are using our token credential enrichment service. So, we embed this in Visa tokens so that we continually update Visa credentials for merchants that subscribe to this service. And then they don't have to worry about consumers updating their credentials when their cards expire, so they don't miss a subscription renewal or a sale, and we have revenue for that service.
We also offer a service, if you think about on the issuer side, that allows our issuers to create a heat map of all their consumers' tokens across the entire ecosystem. And they pay for this service from us so that they can enable their customers to add, view, and manage their Visa cards across merchants that they use in their daily lives. So, we have a vast array of services that we both ship and that we're building and plan to ship built on our tokens. And the revenue that we generate from these token-enabled services is meaningful, and it will be even more meaningful going forward.

Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Ryan, I just want to ask about X Money. How long does a project like that take for you guys to implement with X? Any kind of idea on how fast and how much volume that might ramp? And any thoughts on economics? I assume it's just kind of Visa Direct type transactions.
Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think the X partnership is a great example in what's been a kind of long list of fintech and big tech, crypto, digital wallets, social messaging apps, and the like that have looked around at their options and concluded that the Visa platform, the Visa network and the Visa network of networks is kind of the best, most reliable, biggest money movement platform that's really engineered to enable their developers to quickly implement the types of solutions that they're looking to implement. And it's another great step in that journey that we've been taking. As you said, the partnership is built on the Visa Direct platform.
It's going to allow the 600 million or so active monthly users of X to fund their X Money accounts, so they move money into it. They're going to be able to transfer funds back to their bank account instantly from their X Money account. There's going to be creators on the X platform that can now get paid much faster when they use Visa Direct to move money back into their bank accounts. So, it's a great credit to the partnership between our team and the X Money team and I think building out those use cases, and we're just excited to continue to expand the number of use cases on our platform.

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on commercial.
So, I think I got 6% growth, so a one-point improvement there quarter on quarter. Can you talk more about the trends in commercial spend in 1Q and further improvement expected or, I guess, sustainable here in the '25 outlook relative to what you saw in '24?
Chris Suh
--
Chief Financial Officer
Thanks for the question. You got the numbers right. Commercial volumes were up from Q4, a little over one point. And that Q1 growth was aided by a couple of things: favorable days mix in the U.S.
and internationally, which was the inverse of what I talked about in Q4 where days mix was a little bit of a headwind. I also referenced stronger commercial cross-border volumes as well. And maybe the third one, it's small, but there was less of a drag from ATS as it continues to evolve. I also referenced strong results from client portfolios that helped cross-border volumes in Europe and AP.
That also benefited commercial. This all contributed nicely to our strong new flows revenue performance. That is a trend, in terms of commercial volumes, that is embedded into our expectations, are embedded into our Q2 guidance. We anticipate they remain steady, stable, and strong through the remainder of the year.

Thanks. I was wondering if you could just speak to the point around the strength of the dollar and really like the purchasing power parity associated with that. So, I guess, it plays into cross-border, obviously, for outbound U.S., but it's higher for people to come into the United States. But also, just in terms of just spending patterns, I mean, obviously, this is going to be a strong period for a little while and I'm just wondering to what extent there's a proportional benefit to your business.
Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, clearly, the dollar has strengthened meaningfully and quickly. You got it right, which is, all else equal, with a stronger dollar, you have stronger purchasing power for Americans outside of America. In kind of historical periods where we've had a stronger dollar, we have ultimately seen that lead to some travel patterns outbound from the U.S.
The opposite of that is, obviously, it's more expensive for people to travel to the U.S. In kind of, again, historical periods of relatively stronger dollars, we've seen some shift in travel patterns of people who might otherwise have traveled to the U.S. going to other places around the world. Having said that, it's still early.
This particular situation, we're going to have to monitor. And even though in past times, you have seen some changes in travel corridors as a result of a strengthening dollar, we typically have seen the travel spending overall remain consistent. People just plan their holidays in different places around the world, but that takes time. We're a pretty short period into this stronger dollar period so far.
So, assuming we stay at this point, we'll be able to give you more insight next quarter and future quarters.

Hey, Ryan, hey, Chris, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the regulatory environment in the U.S. Obviously, a new regulatory regime here. Wondering just your view on that and just conversations maybe you've had with issuers or other parties.

Yeah. We're optimistic. Our clients are optimistic. I think what we've heard so far is that the administration wants to move quickly to reduce and simplify regulations, and they're doing it kind of with a goal of spurring economic growth, efficiency, innovation, all very good things.
So, we're optimistic that these changes are going to reduce the regulatory burden for businesses in general in America, which is good for America and ultimately should be good for Visa. We're optimistic as our clients are that they're going to reduce the regulatory burden, specifically in the financial sector, which will in turn help our FI clients accelerate digital payments and in general, run their businesses more efficiently and more effectively, which is very good for them, which is, in turn, good for us.

Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to some of the big deal renewals you discussed early in the call and ask about the interplay of the different revenue lines in these renewals.
What I'm trying to understand is you're obviously making pricing concessions when you enter into these large renewals or deal expansions. To what degree are you able to make up for that with other revenue or VAS being sold into these issuers? And I know this is complicated, but how much is that accounting for the expansion we're seeing in some of the other revenue? Thanks.
Ryan McInerney
--
Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. First, just reflecting on this quarter, the last quarter, as you've seen, we've just been having great tremendous success with clients all over the world. And they continue to choose Visa because of our brand, because of our products, because of our innovation, because of our people, but increasingly because of our value-added services and because of our CMS or new flows capabilities. And I guess I would answer your question this way.
When we engage and our teams engage with partners on these types of renewal, extension, new business deals that you're talking about, it is vastly different than it was three or four years ago. The types of conversations that we're having with our clients are much more multifaceted. They're very rich conversations about a broad array of services that we can provide them, one of which is, of course, network services for their debit cards and credit cards. But in a much more significant way, we're having conversations about processing, about services, about fraud and risk services, about ways that as part of a multifaceted agreement, we can expand from historical relationships in consumer payments to small business cards, commercial cards, specific priorities around fleet, for example, or around agricultural verticals or different types of B2B verticals.
It's a very different sales motion. It's a very different type of negotiation. But importantly, as you alluded to, it involves a lot of different revenue levers than we historically would have had. So, it varies from client to client and market to market and what's important to them.
But our teams are increasingly having success building on deep relationships historically in consumer payments and taking the opportunity of these renewals to really expand our partnerships, especially into new flows opportunities, into VAS opportunities, deepening our relationship with those partners and creating new revenue growth opportunities.

Thank you. Jeff Cantwell with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Great. Thank you. Does the news this week on DeepSeek influence how you're thinking about your business strategy, possibly in terms of whether you're thinking about stepping up the usage of AI to help with managing internal costs or maybe in terms of whether you're thinking about using AI as a tool to support your growth and unlock new revenue opportunities. Because it does appear from an outsider's perspective, AI potentially could help improve operating efficiency.
It might even perhaps support some of your revenue areas like authorization or fraud prevention. So, I wanted to ask you for your view on what DeepSeek and the rise of AI generally means for Visa as far as strategy and where you see opportunity going forward. Thanks.
Ryan McInerney

Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we agree with you. Everything that's happening in the world, whether it's DeepSeek or the many, many things that have happened before and will happen after it, all are examples of opportunities for us broadly across Visa. We were very early adopters of artificial intelligence, and we continue to drive hard at the adoption of generative AI as we have for the last couple of years. So, we've been working to embed AI and AI tooling into our company's operations, I guess, broadly.
We've seen material gains in productivity, particularly in our engineering teams. We've deployed AI tooling in client services, sales, finance, marketing, really everywhere across the company. And we were a very early adopter of applied AI in the analytics and modeling space, very early by like decades, we've been using AI in that space. So, our data science and risk management teams have, at this point, decades of applied experience with AI, and they're aggressively adopting the current generations of AI technology to enhance both our internal and our market-facing predictive and detective modeling capabilities.
Our product teams are also aggressively adopting gen AI to build and ship new products. I think I talked last quarter about data tokens. That's a great example. And just as the Internet itself fundamentally changed the way that we all shop and buy and the way commerce works itself, we deeply believe that AI is going to be a driving force that is going to change the way digital commerce works.
And we have an amazing team of people that are working really hard to ensure that Visa plays a central and sustainable role in the next version of digital commerce. And I think we'll have more to say about that in future quarters.

Hey, thanks. I'll close it out with a question and a clarification if you don't mind. Just on the question with Asia Pac, it looks like that's the only laggard again as a region. Otherwise, growth is really good.
Any change in outlook for Asia Pac? And the usual macro versus structural question there, just curious if there's any change in thinking in the region. My clarification was just on the restructuring. Was that contemplated in your prior guide? I presume that the savings that you get from that will be reinvested pretty quickly. Sorry if I missed that.
Thank you.
Chris Suh

Chief Financial Officer
Great. OK. Let me quickly get to it. Maybe the latter one first, just to clear it.
Restructuring, we recorded a charge this quarter. It's reflected in the guide for the full year. It's really focusing on expenses. We don't expect another charge this year.
And sorry, remind me your first question again.
Ryan McInerney

Chief Executive Officer
Asia Pac.
Chris Suh
--
Chief Financial Officer
Asia Pacific. Yes, sorry. So, AP growth, I think you characterized it right. It is moderately up from Q4, about one point, a little bit more than one point, but it still reflects a somewhat muted environment.
So, it's growing at 1% in total, moving in the right direction but still quite muted.

RISKS
Macau Market Share
: Chairman and CEO Goldstein said, ""We have underperformed in this market. We did not address enough as it relates to customer reinvestment. We believe our buildings would be enough. We were wrong."", indicating that prior strategy did not keep pace with competitive dynamics, driving a necessary shift in approach.
Macau EBITDA Margin Compression
: President and COO Dumont reported, EBITDA margin for the Macau portfolio would have been 31.3% in Q2 2025, down 80 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2024.""

Marina Bay Sands (Singapore) EBITDA
: $768 million at a 55.3% margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2025; $107 million of EBITDA attributable to higher-than-expected hold in the rolling program.

SUMMARY
Management directly acknowledged underperformance and the need for more competitive customer reinvestment in Macau, shifting strategy mid-quarter and noting initial positive impacts in May and June. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands set an unprecedented single-building EBITDA record of $768 million (non-GAAP) in Q2 2025, primarily driven by mass gaming and supported by high-value tourism and product investment, with leadership expressing confidence that an annualized $2.5 billion EBITDA (non-GAAP) is now achievable. The Londoner Grand’s full suite availability led to a meaningful ramp in annualized EBITDA, with further upside tied to ongoing ramp-up and high-end segment penetration. Shareholder returns remained a capital allocation priority, evidenced by significant buybacks and sustained dividends, while ownership in Sands China Ltd. was further increased. Macau’s retail recovery, especially in non-luxury segments, points to broad-based recovery, though hotel inventory constraints may limit overnight visitation growth.
CEO Goldstein said, targeting a $2.7 billion Macau EBITDA run rate in the near term, subject to sustained market acceleration.
Macau GGR recovery in Q2 2025 benefited from both improved citywide visitation and an active event calendar, with sequential growth in base mass and premium segments supported by the Greater Bay Area.
Competitive intensity in Macau remains elevated; management made clear that reinvestment levels will continue to be market-driven, without targeting a fixed EBITDA margin.
Upcoming Marina Bay Sands expansion construction is not expected to disrupt current operations or financial performance since the building site is adjacent and independent of the existing structure.
Singapore’s remarkable performance is attributed to completed renovations, a diverse premium mass patron base, and continued government support for tourism, with expansion initiatives expected to reinforce the long-term investment case.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Las Vegas Sands Corp. Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call.
Operator:
At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode.
Operator:
And we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Las Vegas Sands Corp. Sir, the floor is yours. Thank you. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and CEO, Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Wilfred Wong, Executive Vice Chairman of Sands China, and Grant Chum, CEO and President of Sands China, and EVP of our Asia operation. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making those statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws.
The language on forward-looking statements included in our press release and 8-K filing also applies to our comments made today. The company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website, and we will refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those participants to please pose one question and one follow-up so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Goldstein:
Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. Las Vegas Sands Corp. had a historic quarter with an EBITDA of $768 million. We had forecasted MBS could do $2.5 billion annually, and that may just happen this year. All the pieces are in place for this property to continue to perform. Mass gaming and slot win did $843 million, reflecting 97% growth in Q2 of 2019, percent higher than last year, same quarter. We are in the right place at the right time. Singapore is a very desirable destination. Our product is as good as it gets. It is difficult to find the superlatives that describe the magnitude of this result.
It is unprecedented for a single building to perform like this. Macau did $566 million of EBITDA for the quarter. We have underperformed in this market. We did not address enough as it relates to customer reinvestment. We believe our buildings would be enough. We were wrong. And so in the middle of the quarter, we changed our approach to enable us to increase market share and EBITDA. We will, however, be market sensitive. Our assets remain the strongest in the world. London is open and moving towards our goal of $1 billion in annualized EBITDA. This new approach will create higher market share and EBITDA. At the same time, Macau's GGR accelerated this quarter, a very positive sign.
Our goal is to even now those in accounts increase GGR, and our strong assets will enable us to deliver improved results in the future as a turn to path for more family.
Patrick Dumont:
Thanks, Rob. The Macau EBITDA was $566 million. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been lower by $7 million. When adjusted for higher than expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin for the Macau portfolio properties would have been 31.3%, down 80 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2024. All 2,450 rooms and suites at the Londoner Grand were available for the last two months of the quarter. We are focused on delivering revenue and cash flow growth at the Londoner across the portfolio.
The margin at the Venetian was 35.6%, while the margin at the Plaza of Four Seasons was 34%, and the margin at the Londoner was 31.9%. We expect growth in EBITDA as revenues grow as we use our scale and product advantages together with targeted reinvestment to better address every market segment. Now turning to Singapore. MBS's EBITDA for the quarter was $768 million at a margin of 55.3%. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been lower by $107 million. There will naturally be fluctuations in hold rate in any specific quarter driven by game mix and player preference.
The record financial results of Marina Bay Sands reflect the impact of high-quality investment, market-leading product, and the growth in high-value tourism. We believe we are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of our investments in Marina Bay Sands.
Patrick Dumont:
Turning to our program to return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $800 million of LVS stock during the quarter. We also paid our recurring dividend of $0.25 per share. In addition, during the second quarter and in July, we purchased $179 million worth of SCL stock, increasing the company's ownership percentage of SCL to 73.4% as of today. We believe repurchase of LVS equity through our share repurchase program will be immediately accretive to the company and its shareholders over the long term. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's share repurchase program to increase returns to shareholders. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now let's take questions.
Operator:
Please press star one on your telephone keypad now. Also, we ask each participant to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.
Stephen Grambling:
Hey. Thank you. Starting with Macau, I appreciate the acknowledgment of the shortfall somewhat there, but perhaps remind us of how you are thinking about turning the tide from a competitive standpoint and what KPIs or timing investors should maybe be thinking about in terms of seeing some of the market share going the opposite direction?
Rob Goldstein:
I will take that, Stephen. Thank you for the question. I think around late April, we started to implement a more aggressive customer reinvestment program. And I think we are seeing some encouraging initial results from those increased levels of reinvestment as we get into May and June. The performance of SCL did improve. And I think we will be continuing to adjust to the market conditions as and when necessary. We are also looking at opportunities for us to perform better from our smaller properties. Parisian and Sands, so overall, reception to London has been phenomenal. I think we are getting exceptional feedback from customers. And that is obviously growing nicely.
But obviously, this quarter is still just the start. All of the rooms, as Patrick referenced, were available from late April, and we intend to continue to yield better at London and Macau so that property has much further to go. And then the rest of the portfolio, we have to adjust our reinvestment levels according to the product and according to the individual product mix within the property. And I think this process has only just started, and we will continue to see, I think, improvements in our results as we have done since May and June already.
And as you can see, we have a sequential improvement in our mass GGR market share of 8% for the quarter, and we intend to drive better improvements and also hopefully recapture that market share in the coming quarters.
Patrick Dumont:
So I just want to say one thing, which is we are not where we want to be in Macau. We feel like we have made great investments, we have great products, and we believe we can grow EBITDA from here. We are very focused on it. We realize we have work to do in our reinvestment programs. We have things that we think we can do to be more competitive, and we are going to take some action. And we think we have an approach that we hope in the long run will create growth for us, both on the revenue and EBITDA side. So maybe one quick follow-up there just on Macau.
Stephen Grambling:
You said you are not where you want to be. What does that mean for capital allocation in that market? You know, you used to have a pretty healthy dividend payout in that market as a percentage of free cash flow and earnings. If you go, I mean, should we be waiting for that turnaround to see you go back down that path? And you start, you know, paying out a dividend, is that prior kind of ratio the right way to think about it going forward?
Patrick Dumont:
Yeah. So I think the key thing is that, you know, we have always been focused on return of capital, typically with the dividend at the SCL level. You know, I think as we see the CapEx roll off from the Londoner, which was a very meaningful investment that we feel will generate cash flow over the long term, and we are happy to make it. But that being said, hopefully, our CapEx profile looks better in the future, as you can see from our CapEx expectations that we publish. And so when that happens, we will look to return to increasing the dividend over time with the support of the SCL board.
But for us, we think that the best use of free cash there, other than investing in growth projects, is to return it to shareholders. And you have seen how we have handled it in the past, and we will look forward to doing that again in the future. And I think the levels will be based on our expectations of cash flow production going forward.
Stephen Grambling:
Great. I will yield to the floor. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is live.
Shaun Kelley:
Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. You know, for Grant or whoever wants to take it, maybe we could just start in Macau. We did see across the market a bit of an improvement sequentially as the quarter went on in sort of overall market GGR. We have heard some mixed views about how either promotionally driven or VIP or event-driven that was. So hoping to get a little bit of color on just what is driving that improvement, how sustainable you think it is, and just broader health of the macro in the market right now?
Grant Chum:
Sure. Thanks for the question, Shaun. I think the market clearly accelerated from May, and June obviously was a standout performance, I think helped by the calendar of events that prevailed in June. If you look at the segment breakdown, clearly, as you can see from the DRCJ data as well, rolling the VIP segment performed very well during the quarter and was up 26% year on year, up by our estimates. But the non-rolling and then slot win also improved, and we are still in the high single-digit growth region for the quarter. So I think there are some very encouraging signs.
I think a mix between improved city but also the calendar of events and the offerings by the operators helping to drive the increased patronage as well.
Shaun Kelley:
Thanks for that, Grant. And then maybe just to switch gears as a follow-up on Singapore. Rob, obviously, incredible performance on the numbers. I mean, over $700 million from a single building in a single quarter is kind of hard to wrap your brain around. Can you give us your best stab at how we should think about, you know, maybe a run rate or level of productivity for this property moving forward? Are we sustainably above $600 million of EBITDA a quarter?
I know what we have a good sense of what your stretch goal here is at $2.5 billion core, but just help us think about it to level set expectations given it was not a fairly easy comp on the mass market. And obviously, VIP, you know, it can be volatile quarter to quarter on the handle side. Thanks.
Rob Goldstein:
It is hard to predict, is it not? I mean, I do not think we forecasted a $770 million quarter. I do not think we have a clear view of it. If this is sustainable, this go forward. You know, it is proving that it would be an amazing market, and we have the best assets by far in the market. So how high is up and how deep is that well? I do not know. The truth is it would be very difficult to dismiss these results and say, we are now heading through $2.5 billion. Do we need to get to $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion? Can I continue? It is showing it is very hard to predict.
It is not an easy market. There has never been anything like this in the history of gaming anywhere. You know, you realize this thing this run rate is a $3 billion asset. We do not expect to do that now, think, yeah, $2.5 billion is realistic and doable. But I would not want to venture a guess. I would not want to dismiss the results because I want to overhype them and say, every quarter is $750 million. I think that is unfair. But could we do $600 million plus or $650 million? Possibly. Yeah. It depends on how strong the economy remains over there and the super high end the markets there. And we dominate it.
And we are kind of low in that place as far as the super high end. So it could be that we are looking at a whole new world of Singapore, and we will have to wait and see. Time will tell. We just do not know. We did not see this coming this early. We have only come later. That is here. So deal with it.
Shaun Kelley:
Thank you very much.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Dan Politzer from JPMorgan. Your line is live.
Dan Politzer:
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back and circle on Macau. Right? It seems like you guys are, you know, going to be more promotional. You are, you know, going to get, you know, be focused on generating that EBITDA level. Is there a targeted EBITDA share that we should think about that kind of gets you to where you want to be just looking at the historical 33% to 35% EBITDA share you have had in that market, or, you know, how should we kind of assess, you know, your strategy there and when your KPIs for getting back to a level you think is appropriate?
Rob Goldstein:
I think we should take this one step at a time. Our goal we acknowledge our failure in believing our assets were so strong we could overcome this very different environment we are used to. We have now jumped at the water. We are not leading the market. We are simply in the mix. And that is a good thing. I believe our assets our short-term goal in your quarters is to get we believe the Londoner and Venetian can generate $2 billion between them. We believe that the Four Seasons will do $300 million plus IT operation do $300 million plus. We need to stand to do $100 million more because things are changing down to pencil.
Our short-term goal, my goal I hope the team shares that, is that we can get a $2.7 billion run rate and come off the bottom here. I think at $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion, we are just not performing well enough. We have the best assets, so three things, acceleration of GGR is very helpful. The most important thing by far is that. Second thing is we have the best the biggest assets in that town. The most rooms, the best product. And third thing is we have come off our thinking. We changed our thinking.
So I am hoping that Grant and team can see near future, you know, $600 million plus $650 million down the road and get us on the back to the $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion range. That is our short-term goal. Beyond that, wait until the market matures. Let us face it. If this market turns on the accelerate to this rate, we might see everyone doing much better. That would be a best in all Macau. I think it is very possible that happens in 2025, even 2026, 2027. So this is just our acknowledgment that we did not do a good enough job in that environment, and we are doing it now.
And we are full phase, and our team over there, our assets perform and get us back in the game.
Dan Politzer:
Got it. Thanks. That is helpful detail. Just to follow-up on Singapore. You know, is there any way to kind of wrap our heads around that sudden acceleration in those gaming volumes? Because it does seem like those it is pretty concentrated on just the gaming side. And, I mean, we are trying to parse this out if there were new customers, maybe reception for the property improvements and new suite product. Anything in the event calendar? Just trying to make sense of what is obviously, you know, typically the seasonally softest quarter of the year here to be so strong.
Patrick Dumont:
I think a lot of it has to do with the product. You know, we spent the last couple of years reinvesting there significantly. Not only in the physical product, but also in the service levels, the experience we can provide to people. And the type of customer we have coming through the property and the nature where Singapore sits today, the growing economies are well created in Southeast Asia. It just it is all working. We have a very strong view on the future of Singapore. You can see by the type of customers that we have coming in, that it is not only a very strong market, but it is very deep.
And so for us, yes, there are new customers coming in. They are attracted by what we have on offer. They are coming to Singapore to do business. They are coming to Singapore for leisure travel. And they are showing up on renter-based ads, and they are consuming. So it is great. It is a tribute to the team there and the investment that we have made and the way we execute. But really there, it is just a reflection of who is coming into the market and the fact that we provide experiences that are pretty unique and they are really taking advantage of. We are a different building than we were five years ago.
If you come and visit and you see it, you will see the differences and realize that we attract a very high level of patron.
Rob Goldstein:
I think you also have to give credit to the government of Singapore, which allows us to train and excel. And Patrick referenced that building there last week for the groundbreaking November of the second building. It is an amazing place, but the market is also four billion Asian people at the very top and looking for an extraordinary experience and assets we have in space over there. I think the truth is that building the system is desirable, it is super high end. And there is lots of a lot of people to Singapore. And propensity to gamble, as you know, is high in that part of the world. So we are just in a very fortunate position.
I do not see it changing. I think we are in a very privileged position and hoping this long for a long time. So we are not one to forecast that it is $600 million, $700 million, $800 million a quarter. But we know we are in the right place, right time with extraordinarily strong assets. And excellent government support, and a very strong market in terms of Singapore visitation.
Patrick Dumont:
Like, one other thing that is important to note is we started to see some inklings of this as we started finishing the renovation. But now everything is pretty much done. And so we are starting to see the results as we build customer experience and as they get to experience the property and see how it is to be there and the different things that we offer, in this new format. It is starting to show results. I mean, this is really just a direct result of the completion of the renovation and the type of customers that we can attract. With the products that are there now.
Dan Politzer:
Got it. Thanks. It is nice to see the investment there for Thanks.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Your line is live.
Brandt Montour:
Good afternoon or good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is on Macau. I think from where we sit, it is sort of hard to we see we see clearly a strengthening of the Chinese consumer in your market and gambling propensity. I was wondering if you could flesh that out a little bit and talk about spend per visit improvement sequentially across either base mass or premium mass. We all kind of thought it would be a premium mass sort of recovery here in May and June, but I look at your slides, it looks like base mass upper table actually did better.
So maybe you could just provide a little more color on who is spending more where.
Grant Chum:
Hi, Brandt. Maybe I will take that question. I think overall visitation has been very strong. You see results for April and May are up by over 20% year on year. Obviously, a lot of that is driven by the data visitors from the Greater Bay Area. But nonetheless, I think that is helping to drive some of the base mass recovery. But no question, I think, the acceleration GGR is still primarily driven by the premium segments. I think this quarter in particular, the market benefited from some big rolling play. But also at the high end of the premium mass. So I think that those dynamics remain similar to previous quarters.
But we are beginning to see also increased level of visitation, albeit more from the Greater Bay Area. In terms of patrons. And then, of course, from our results as well, sequentially, I think you alluded to it. Clearly, we grew quite significantly in the base mass on rolling wind against Q1. And that is partly driven by the opening of the Londoner Grand.
Brandt Montour:
Okay. That is super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. On Macau. You know, the Londoner results clearly had a nice bounce here in the second quarter. And you alluded to in your prepared remarks that some of the other properties did not do quite as well. Am I to read between the lines that the Londoner is the property that has received the most incremental reinvestment activity and the other properties have not, and that is kind of mixed up in terms of your, sort of blueprint or game plan here, or is that not the right read through?
Grant Chum:
No. That is not entirely accurate. In terms of high reinvestment levels, that just went into the portfolio across the board. I think what we are referencing earlier remarks is that we may need to further and we have been further adjusting our reinvestment levels during the quarter towards the end of the quarter for some of our smaller properties. Because we think those products, given the size of the product level, may need recalibration in the reinvestment levels versus the natural patronage that is flocking to Londoner. And also the strength of the property like Venetian continues to be able to attract customers at all segments.
Brandt Montour:
Great color. Thanks, everyone.
Operator:
Thanks, Brandt. Thank you. Your next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is live.
Robin Farley:
Great. Thank you. Just going back to the acceleration you talked about in June in Macau, it seems like, you know, it driven at least a fair amount of it by the events calendar. And so how do you get comfortable that it is sustainable as you get past, you know, some of the July events and the calendar not being as sustainable in terms of events.
Grant Chum:
I think, Robin, the calendar is being filled literally every week, every month by all of the different operators, us included. The change from before the pandemic is really every operator is contributing to the event calendar. And, of course, the big events brought in whether by us at the Venetian arena or by our competitor is beneficial to the entire market. When we have significant acts. And that will obviously not be a consistent pattern, because acts come in different times of the year and different length, duration of play and so on. But you can be sure that the calendar will continue to be filled with great entertainment content.
And I think Macau has really been successful in establishing itself as a regional center for entertainment, be it from Greater China artists, Asian artists, even international artists.
Rob Goldstein:
Robin, I would just add to Grant's comments that I think it was last year I would not give us credit in Singapore because Taylor Swift made the whole thing happen. She was not available this quarter, but still did pretty well. I think the truth I think she was could not get her to come. She was busy. But the truth is we have in Macau, yes, lots of events. But I have learned over the years that events rearrange the customer visitation. You do not necessarily create new much as the rearrange will come and go. And I think that market is showing strength, the strength in June results. I think you just see a building.
And, yes, there is no question we have a Jackie Chung in somebody's high-end entertainer health. But again, I think you have to look at the strength of the market overall, and I believe it is there. I have not been there last month to look the first time it looked like pre-pandemic Macau. Very strong, a lot of people at tables. Do not believe the entertainers even special events, that should create more business. We arrange when you come. But so I would not be that concerned with the event count. Although, it is chock full of events, everyone has entertainment these days and terrific restaurants, etcetera.
But I think you have to look at the beautiful results the last few months to be very encouraged when the calendar year is we had.
Robin Farley:
Okay. Great. Thank you. And for the follow-up, just a quick one. Are you thinking about revisiting what you can a normal hold percent in Singapore? And I know you just raised it in Q1, but I am wondering if you are thinking about whether that 3.7% was high enough for normalized hold. Thanks.
Rob Goldstein:
I would not let one quarter drive your thinking. I think you have to stay focused on. Again, this is a very, very difficult thing for us and other competitors because as you know, whole percentage is a moving target these days, driven by who bets what. How. And so it really does move. As you go to smart tables that enable us to see much more clearly. Great insight into how the market should perform. I am going to move our whole percentage right now. Until we see more evidence, but it does change with the market and visitation. Types of best customers make. In the old days, it was No. 2.85, 3.25. That is no longer in Vowel.
It is now very much a moving target. Depending on who is coming, what they are betting, side bets versus top bets. I think we will come back to you in the future if we need to reassess right now, and we are fine where we are at.
Robin Farley:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Joseph Stauff from Susquehanna. Your line is live.
Joseph Stauff:
Okay. Thank you. Afternoon. In Singapore, you know, maybe a different attempt to ask, you know, a similar question that we have heard earlier on the call, but can I ask about just sort of mass gaming revenue and how strong it was? You know, is that simply a function of, you know, better hold, is it increased visitation? You know, it is admittedly another question that just tries to have a bent, you know, try to benchmark with the newer product that you have in Singapore, you know, how strong this number could be? Obviously, VIP is, you know, a separate category.
Different level of volatility, but, you know, how much is there any way to disaggregate this number a little bit more for understanding?
Rob Goldstein:
Hey. Just say this. Not going to lie to answer, but it is very difficult for us to do it. As long as you do $843 million up 97% pre-pandemic. And 40% higher year on year. It is hard for us to get our hands around it. But there is a whole lot of people show up. In all these segments, and getting the outsized amounts of money. And your question is a fair one. I wish we had better answers. How deep is the well? How wide can this thing go? We are confused ourselves by it. Because we expected $2.5 billion, and now I think we can say we can achieve it this year.
And I think it is a combination of incredible market, incredible access to, you know, people who get there, the Visa situation is helpful, and I think you are seeing the results of very, very superlative results into the building. Building is just unique and special, and there is lots of product. So I know it is difficult to I hear your frustration. We share it. We got over we do not exaggerate this and say we will run $3 billion. We also do not want to underplay. We want to accept the fact it happened, and it has happened now two quarters of really strong results. Hoping for a similar second half of the year.
And it is hard to model. I would be blunt with you. Think one thing I would say you say, Masp gave me premium mass gaming is alive and well in those numbers. You know, these are non-rolling very high rolling. Do not consider people betting $1,000 a hand. This premium mass segment which is in that $847 million or $843 million, there is a lot of very, very high-end non-rollers, you know, which is different than past Macau. So I appreciate the commentary of your question. It is very fair. I wish we had more insightful answers, but we keep watching this thing and saying, you know, we lost a quarter with amazement. But just kept coming.
And I think, oh, just keep coming in Singapore. Whether we beat the customer is a different issue, it was 3.7, 3.3, we never could know. But the volumes look strong, and to me, it appears like we are at a run here that they last for a long time.
Joseph Stauff:
Gotcha. And then maybe a follow-up. You know, Formula One is pushing the fourth quarter in Singapore this year. Versus September last. What is the right way to think about, you know, whether or not the rest of the building can absorb the, you know, that normal activity or, you know, do you view that as, you know, a bit of a headwind?
Patrick Dumont:
Formula One is always a great event for Singapore. It is something that we fully support. We are an integral part of. And we always welcome it. And I think our patrons really enjoy it. You know, a lot of visitors show up in Singapore because of this event. And for us, whenever it happens, it is great. So if it is third quarter, fourth quarter, we are happy with it. You know, we do our best to support the initiative around it because we think it is great for Singapore. It is great for Marina Bay Sands and the type of customers that show up are always very helpful.
But in terms of being able to accommodate customers in Q3, during Golden Week with Formula One, it is fine. Either way, it works.
Joseph Stauff:
Understood. Thanks a lot.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is live.
Chad Beynon:
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to go back to Macau, Rob. You mentioned $2.7 billion as the near-term, you know, NorthStar and hopefully that eventually moves kind of back to $3 billion. But wanted to approach it from a margin standpoint. So Londoner had nice improvement in margin, you know, the collective was down 80 basis points as you guys called out. And the flow-through was obviously negative here for the quarter.
But does margin matter as much in terms of how you are thinking about running the business or given maybe we should not have a margin some of the commentary that we have spoken about with promos, target in mind just because of simple inflation. And a different approach towards promo, or is that still the case to get to, you know, closer to a 40% margin long term? Thanks.
Patrick Dumont:
So I think the key thing about Macau is that there is a very large fixed cost base in our property portfolio. And so our margin is going to be determined by how much revenue we can push through these buildings. And so if our promotional activity, if our customer reinvestment makes us a little less competitive and we have less revenue, our margins will be impacted. So I think for us, x hold. Right? If you ignore the impact of hold, if we continue to have the best properties where we have great offerings for our customers, and great experiences, and then we reinvest in a more market competitive way.
We think we will still have the ability to drive revenue at an appropriate margin. And so if you look at the margin regime where we are today, that is okay for now. But then we grow revenues, grow the business over time, there might be some opportunity for some upside. But I do not think we are looking at a specific EBITDA margin in terms of our reinvestment guidance. Our reinvestment guidance is going to be based on the market, hopefully, we will grow revenues based on our product portfolio. We put a whole lot of new products into the market this last quarter. Right? The Londoner Grand is a whole new building.
And the casino performance there is great. We have tremendous spot performance coming out of the Londoner. Total portfolio. And I think for us, as you heard Grant, as you heard Rob mentioned before, we have some work to do. That being said, I think there are opportunities in the creation. I think there are opportunities in the Four Seasons. And even downtown in the Sands, we think there is opportunity. So while we keep pushing the Venetian to Londoner, our segmentation had different reinvestment requirements. And we are going to keep looking at it and evaluating the segmentation across different properties to ensure that we can optimize for revenue growth. And cash flow growth.
And so we are not targeting a specific EBITDA margin, but we believe over time as we have the opportunity to grow revenues, the margin will fall.
Rob Goldstein:
And, Chad, margin does matter. But EBITDA matters more. And in any business, you have to be sensitive to the environment you are playing in, and the environment there has changed. We were sensitive enough. So now we are going to adjust that coupled with our strong asset. We add that to a growing surge in GGR. I think you have a good formula, but obviously, we always want to be margin sensitive. We want to be EBITDA. Sensitive too. So it is a combination. It is not a simple question to answer. Each building performs differently.
Chad Beynon:
Great. Thank you both. And then the news that we have seen in terms of the movement from the Thai cabinet, you know, with withdrawing the bill at this point for legalized casinos. I guess there is probably no update from your end because we are probably reading the same information, but anything to talk about there or any other potential developments that you guys plan to pursue outside of the two markets that you are in?
Patrick Dumont:
Thank you. I think we are constantly looking at new development growth opportunities in new jurisdictions. We are evaluating them as they come along. You know, it is something that we feel like in Thailand, there is a great opportunity there. If the legal framework and the regulatory framework is appropriate, something we will definitely look at and consider. As of right now, as you just mentioned, there is not a whole lot to think about.
Rob Goldstein:
Thailand is the greatest opportunity in Asia. What is left of those countries. It is so hard to tell us how to do day-to-day changes, but it certainly is for anybody in our industry. A very important place if it ever actually comes to fruition.
Chad Beynon:
Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next is coming from Lizzie Dove from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.
Lizzie Dove:
Hi there. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned earlier that the goal of the Londoner is to move towards the goal of a billion dollars in annualized EBITDA. Curious, you know, timing of that, how much more reinvestment, gonna promotions are needed to get there, and, yeah, more so just the cadence to get there.
Grant Chum:
I think we are only just started, ramping up the property. I mean, if you think about the Londoner Grand, it really only fully launched in May onwards. So we are still in the very early innings of the ramp-up in London. And we are already running, you know, close to $800 million annualized. So we do see opportunity to yield higher and higher across all of the hotels in London Macau, but especially London and Grand. I think Patrick just referenced there with we are seeing exceptional slot in EDG performance out of London already way surpassing what this building was achieving in 2019. And I think we are seeing high levels of non-rolling table performance as well.
And so as all these segments continue to grow, and we put higher quality customers into the suites and the rooms. We will get to that $1 billion annualized that Rob referenced. That is the goal. We do not know the exact timing, but we are pretty clear only at the very start of the ramp-up.
Lizzie Dove:
Got it. Makes sense. And then just going back to the promotionality side of things, obviously, it is something you have been kind of ramping up over the last couple of months. So I am curious what you have seen from other players and how the competitive environment has evolved whether they have responded with, you know, the same level of promotionality, whether there has been a rash.
Grant Chum:
The market continues to be very competitive. I do not think the intensity is dropping at all. Each operator is fighting for a greater share of the pie. I think the main difference, of course, this quarter is that we also are in the mix now in terms of reinvestment levels. Back to the customer. And we see the response we see the initial signs are encouraging. And, of course, it is more biased towards the high-end segments where the levels of customer investment are shifting the players back to our properties. Or gaining new customers, especially through the Londoner.
So that process will continue and we will continue to evaluate, but we do not expect the competitive dynamics to ease off. I think that will continue to be intense. But, of course, a high level of GGR and acceleration in the market growth will help all of us like Rolf mentioned, that is still the single biggest factor. In determining the results of not just our performance, but of the whole market.
Lizzie Dove:
Got it. Thank you.
Grant Chum:
Thanks, Lizzie.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Choi from Citigroup. Your line is live.
George Choi:
Thank you very much for taking my question. So over the past several months, we have seen you guys took the side desk from Marina Bay Sands and introduced them to your Macau operation. And just recently, we saw you guys added a progressive jackpot to your background music account, and we believe that all those also run-in from Marina Bay Sands. So my question is, do you still have any best practices at Marina Bay Sands that your Macau operations can learn from?
Rob Goldstein:
It is a work in progress, George. We obviously trade information back and forth based on best practices, and we saw a lot of success in Singapore with side bets. I think we will see it in Macau, and we continue, as you know, ahead of us. You are over there. You are so on top of this. It is frightening. But congratulations. I think the truth is we are learning as we go. I am a firm believer that these markets are not that different in terms of customer activity. I think in the end, you will see a lifetime result in the calendar time. It is newer to the Macau market. It is a longer it approved there.
But really confident that this new era of smart tables, side beds, which is increasing whole percentage for everyone all of our competitors as well. Is highly positive for the industry. And exciting for the customers. So time will tell how long it takes to see the increased toll percentage and how much they move towards side beds, but we are big believers in this. As long as we are trying to be very innovative as you alluded to in your comments. And how we view the markets and gambling is changing every day. We want to be leaders in that evolving process.
George Choi:
Thank you very much for the great color. I will jump back to the queue.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is live.
David Katz:
Afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start with Singapore. Where there is obviously significant investment coming, you know, for further expansion. And, you know, things have started to finally really go well in the core building. And, you know, frankly, we have been waiting for it for a few years. I want to make sure, you know, when there is not construction disruption or, you know, what if anything just to make sure, could sort of impact the momentum that you have there in Singapore?
Patrick Dumont:
So just a couple of things. The site is adjacent to Marina Bay Sands. So in the renovation work, we did at Marina Bay Sands, in the prior years that you referenced, it was actually an actively operating building while we were doing it. So it is a little bit like changing your tires in the middle of an F1 race. While you are driving. And so we did that. And so the good news is the building is in terms of suite renovation, interior is complete. Starting to see the benefits of that in the results of this quarter. Our expansion and we actually had the groundbreaking last week. Dr. Adelson was there, Rob was there. I was there.
I was there. Some other members of the LVS management team were there. Anderson was there. There. And most importantly, the prime minister and the minister, Grace Booz, responsible for the portfolio was there. It was an amazing groundbreaking. And we are very happy to have the government support, and we are very fortunate to be in Singapore. And so, you know, this is a very important complex for tourism for both leisure and business tourism in the market. And for us, any disruption is something we take really seriously. And so the good news is we have a little bit more than seven to eight per site directly next door. And it is its own site.
And so when we build this, ultimately, there will be connections to activate the fans. But during the construction, it is not going to impact our ability to conduct operations. So unlike the renovation we just did, it is something separate into state. And then we will bridge over to it during the construction process, but it will not be disrupted.
David Katz:
Perfect. And if I can ask one quick follow-up on the strategic, you know, evolution in Macau. You talked about reinvestment rates, but I wanted to ask about credit and whether that is, you know, a tool that you would be using and how that starts to show up. Does it sort of show up maybe later on in and, you know, on the cost side of the equation? Is there any of that in there that we should be keeping our eye out for?
Grant Chum:
No. I think in terms of the credit base play, it is a very small portion of our overall GGR traditionally, and we have been doing this for two decades. We extend credit to some premium patrons in the direct rolling programs. But it has been a consistent practice of ours, and we are very experienced in it. But it is not a significant part of the GGR.
David Katz:
Okay. Thank you.
Rob Goldstein:
Sure. Thank you.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from John DeCree from CBRE. Your line is live.
John DeCree:
Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask one about your retail mall portfolio, particularly retail sales. We are seeing a little bit of acceleration in Mainland China. It looks like in Macau, you have seen a little bit of lift in the two Q as well. We got a lot of questions about the sustainability of GGR growth, which you have fielded already today, but curious if you could give us some thoughts on what you are seeing in the retail mall, particularly on the luxury side of things.
Grant Chum:
Thanks for the question. The retail mall tenant sales are starting to see a good recovery. In the second quarter. So we were in positive tenant sales year on year basis. We are growing by about 10% across the retail mall portfolio in Macau. And within that, luxury is still relatively weaker versus the rest of the portfolio. But we did start to see within the quarter signs that even the luxury sales were improving. Partly because also we have been introducing some pretty amazing flagship stores in some of the key luxury brands. In the portfolio. So you will continue to see that being a feature of the Four Seasons more into the beginning of 2026.
So there are some improvements that we are making ourselves that should help to lift the luxury sales portion of more. But overall, we are happy to see that Moore is back in a positive sales territory, double-digit growth in the second quarter. Compared to last year.
John DeCree:
Great. Thanks, Grant. If I could follow-up with one big picture question about visitation. So visitation from Mainland ex Guangdong, which you have highlighted in your slide deck, is kind of sluggish to recovery relative to the day trippers in the Bay Area. Pretty big opportunity. So feel curious given your room base in Macau, it seems like this is probably a your views if there is an opportunity and what can be done to kind of help Macau start to penetrate deeper into Mainland and see some of that visitation outside of Guangdong come back.
Grant Chum:
It is a great question. I think Ben and his tech has the breakout of the provinces visitation. As compared to 2019. It is on page 20 of the deck. I think what you see is, yes, you are right. Overall, excluding Guangdong, the recovery of visitation is still lagging. But within that, it is very uneven. So some of the wealthier coastal provinces and the major cities we are seeing recovery beyond the 2019 visitation levels. And some of the other provinces are lagging. Much more significantly. So I agree. It is an opportunity.
And I think Macau and the operators are continuously doing the destination marketing road shows across the different parts of mainland China as well as overseas, and that will continue. Transportation is continuing to improve in terms of pricing and connectivity. And, of course, the availability of hotel rooms and, of course, we have been adding high-quality inventory as have some other operators as well. So we accept all of those factors to drive better penetration in the non-Guangdong. Visitation numbers. Especially helping to drive that overnight visitation, which is clearly the highest spending segment. But that said, the overall hotel inventory in Macau is not significantly growing. So that will continue to add as a constraint.
On the overall overnight visitation. But I think what you see is a continued improvement in the quality of the tourism. Coming to stay overnight in Macau.
John DeCree:
That is really helpful. Thanks a lot, Grant. Thanks all.
Operator:
Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is live.
Steve Wieczynski:
Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered, so just one for me. So Robert or Patrick, I mean, as we think about Singapore and Patrick, you mentioned just you guys just started construction on IR two. But, you know, based on what you have witnessed, you know, over the last six months, eight months coming out of IR one and the kind of the crazy numbers that you guys have been putting up over there out of IR one. Has that changed your internal return assumptions for IR two at this point?
Patrick Dumont:
I do not think so. Look, I think we generally have a view that Marina Bay Sands and Singapore is an investment-driven story. And so the more we invest in high-quality assets, the better service levels we have, the more we are going to have pricing power, we are going to be able to differentiate our products, and the more high-value tourism we will be able to bring in. And of that, we will get more revenue, we will get more EBITDA. So you are seeing that happen this quarter in Singapore. It is the full product, full power of our sweet products. The full power of our food and beverage offerings, our mice offerings. Everything is really coming together.
All the entertainment we do, high level of service, but we have a great premium mass customer base there. Look, the shopping all the other things that we have added, it is really a very unique lifestyle program that we offer to people. And so for us, IR two is just an extension of that. You know, look, our goal is to have the best hotel in the world there. Have the best gaming experience, the best food and beverage, and then have this live entertainment venue the likes of which we have never had before in terms of to be able to drive customer visitation. So feel very strongly about this.
You know, it is a $6 billion investment, $2 billion of a premium that we have to pay the government. And we feel very strongly about the quality of that investment in work and go. So adjustment in models is not where we are at now. It is a very long way away. You know, we have got a couple of years before it opens, but in our mind, this quarter and actually to be fair, what we have been seeing in the quarters leading up to this in terms of the high quality of patron that we have. Just validates the fact that we feel very strongly this will be a high-quality investment.
And so while we have not adjusted our models, in any formal way, I think this just validates long term in our minds. The quality of the market and the strength of Singapore.
Steve Wieczynski:
Okay. Gotcha. Appreciate that, Patrick.
Patrick Dumont:
Thanks, Steve.

Thanks, Jennifer. This quarter, our financial performance once again demonstrated the power of Visa Inc.'s diverse business model, global scale, commitment to innovation, and relentless focus on our clients. We delivered net revenue of $10.2 billion, up 14% year over year, and EPS up 23% year over year. Our key business drivers were strong. In constant dollars, overall payments volume grew 8% year over year. US payment volume grew 7%, and international payments volume grew 10%. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe rose 11% in constant dollars, and processed transactions grew 10% year over year. We are obsessed about serving our clients, waking up every morning thinking about what we can do to help them be successful today and in the future.
We recently completed our annual global client engagement survey where Visa Inc. again received a net promoter score of 76, a tangible sign of how our clients feel about Visa Inc. and our capabilities, services, and products. And as I'm sure you all saw, we hosted our product drop on April 30th. We shared how we are continuing to evolve the Visa as a Service stack and to advance our product developments and lead in a number of areas, including AI and stablecoins, across consumer payments, commercial and money movement solutions, and value-added services. Now let's look at some of the specific innovations and progress across our growth pillars this quarter.
In consumer payments, we continued to grow through a focus on solutions to address both carded and non-carded volumes across the globe. Total credentials were up 7% year over year, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of at least 7% growth. We are nearing 15 billion tokens, and now more than 50% of our e-commerce transactions are tokenized globally, getting closer to our ultimate goal of reaching 100% penetration. As we continue to transform Visa Inc. cards for a more digital future, our Flex credential is an important solution. We have seen interest across various use cases such as buy now pay later, small business, multicurrency, and more.
This quarter, we announced that Klarna will be launching a Klarna card powered by our Flex credential in both the US and Europe. We also expanded FlexCredential geographically with inaugural clients in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Bangladesh, and we have a pipeline of more than 200 client opportunities. Another way that we are advancing a more digital future is with Visa Inc. and which enables consumers to shop and buy with AI agents. It combines a suite of integrated APIs including AI-ready cards with tokenization and authentication, together with a commercial partner program for AI platforms, enabling developers to deploy Visa Inc.'s AI commerce capabilities securely and at scale.
We are excited to announce that we have more than 30 partners testing in our live sandbox, and we will soon enter the live transaction pilot phase with general availability to follow later this year as we see Agentic commerce becoming a reality. In the face-to-face environment, we continue to drive cash digitization and habituation through our tap-to-everything use cases. Tap-to-pay penetration is now at 78% of face-to-face transactions globally. As a result of our efforts to increase issuance and acceptance, especially transit, which drives habituation, we now have 75 US cities at 60% penetration or higher, up from 30 cities just last year, and New York City and San Francisco have now surpassed 85% and 80% respectively.
Tap-to-Phone added a record 3 million transacting devices this quarter, and tap-to-add card continues to expand with more than 275 issuers participating globally, almost doubling from last quarter. For affluent consumers, we are excited to launch Visa Infinite Privilege in Brazil, a new super-premium offering with personalized exclusive experiences enabled by dedicated life managers for each affluent user. Itau Unikred and XP International are our inaugural issuer partners. In Canada, our Visa Infinite affluent offerings for fintech, Wealthsimple, has been their most requested product with tens of thousands of cards issued in just two months and hundreds of thousands on the waitlist. Throughout all these innovations, we have continued to deepen our relationships with our clients across the globe.
We renewed our partnership with Absa, a leading pan-African bank in consumer and commercial issuance, consulting, and CyberSource across nine countries. And in India, we renewed our consumer credit agreements with HDFC and Access Bank this quarter, two of the country's top five credit card issuers. Our consumer payment strategy is also focused on non-carded solutions like Visa A2A in the UK. With this offering, we bring together Visa Inc.'s brand, consumer protections, technology, and risk management capabilities to enable simpler, safer, and more secure account-to-account payments. We released APIs on the Visa developer platform a few months ago, and we now have several partners on board and even more in our pipeline with a formal launch soon.
Also in the A2A space, we're making a very deliberate effort to focus on open banking in the markets that have the greatest potential, such as Europe and Latin America. As an example, in Brazil, we have developed Visa Connecta, a payment initiator that connects with PICS to facilitate open banking payments through Tink technology, both in the face-to-face environment but more specifically in e-commerce where conversion is a challenge due to the current customer experience. Now moving to commercial and money movement solutions or CMS, where we continue to pursue new use cases and verticals, domestic and cross-border flows, and develop unique products.
This quarter, commercial payments volume was up 7% in constant dollars, Visa Direct transactions grew 25%, and CMS revenue rose 13% year over year in constant dollars. In Visa commercial solutions, one of our key strategies is addressing the day-to-day challenges of small and large businesses through our vertical-specific solutions. In the healthcare and benefits vertical, we are very active, including providing solutions for employee benefits to more than half of the top HSA providers in the US. A recent example of our activity in the benefits space is with Sunny, a healthcare fintech that will issue Visa prepaid disbursement cards to their millions of US consumers to spend integrated health benefits and rewards.
In the travel vertical, Checkout.com will begin using Visa virtual cards for online travel agencies or OTAs in the UK and Europe. In addition, client already an important issuing partner across numerous verticals in Europe, will be expanding into the US, bringing their virtual card as a service offerings with spend management capabilities to OTAs, travel management companies, and others in the travel vertical. In the fleet and fuel vertical, we continue to make progress with our Fleet 2.0 solution, providing key Visa enhancements such as EMV chips, digital wallet provisioning, and contactless payments.
In Europe, Octopus Energy, one of the region's largest energy suppliers, selected Visa Inc. as their partner as they start issuing cards to fleet managers seeking a single payment solution to manage mobility expenses. In Visa Direct, we have made some important progress in facilitating cross-border flows to further our positioning as the largest money movement platform by volumes and endpoints. One of the biggest banks in the UAE, with over 60 branches serving over one million customers, ADIB will use Visa Direct to power Remit, their newly launched remittances program by offering access to cards, accounts, and wallets across all corridors.
In Bangladesh, we have signed our first four partners to enable Visa Direct: Magna Bank, Trust Bank, Midland Bank, and BRAC Bank, specifically for outbound cross-border payments. And in the US and Canada, Paysend, who we have discussed before as an important Visa Direct remittance client with ten million customers, is now expanding to add more cross-border use cases such as gig economy worker payouts, payroll disbursements, and accounts payable flows as a reseller to third parties. Before I go to value-added services, I think it is important to touch on a topic that has had a lot of interest lately, stablecoins.
We are supportive of the Genius Act, and we believe that it marks a key milestone on the path to regulatory clarity for stablecoins. We have been active in this space for almost a decade and believe that stablecoins can solve important payments problems for certain use cases. We believe that Visa Inc.'s role is to do what we always do: provide trust, standards, connectivity, billions of endpoints, scale, and interoperability to the payments ecosystem. Beyond capital markets use cases, we see product market fit for stablecoins in two important areas. One, in emerging markets where the local fiat currency is volatile and/or where consumers do not have easy or affordable access to US dollars.
And two, in cross-border money movement, both B2B payments and consumer remittances. Our in-market solutions, partnerships, market activity, and product roadmap reflect our commitment to this space. For example, we have deployed stablecoin-linked cards in many markets around the world with partners such as Bridge, Rain, and Banks. In the emerging market use case I mentioned earlier, consumers and businesses are using stablecoins to save money in US dollars, but they also want easy and safe ways to spend that money. And there's no better way to do that than using a Visa Inc. card. Stablecoin-linked Visa Inc. cards are an extension of what we have been doing in the crypto space for years.
Since 2020, we have enabled crypto users to spend more than $25 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum, an array of other cryptocurrencies, and now stablecoins. We are also enabling cross-border money movement capabilities for P2P and B2B in certain emerging markets, and we are piloting and partnering with stablecoin payments companies who specialize in these markets as we build out our stablecoin treasury stack for settlement and money movement flows. A recent example is with Yellowcard in Sub-Saharan Africa. Together, we are working to streamline treasury operations, improve liquidity management, and enable quick and more cost-efficient cross-border transactions. Additionally, we are also helping banks issue their own stablecoins and realize the benefits of programmable money through our Visa tokenized asset platform.
We offer multichain and multi-coin stablecoin settlement on the Visa Inc. network. We recently expanded our capabilities by adding a euro-backed stablecoin ERC, and through a partnership with Paxos, to additional regulated stablecoins USDG and PYUSD. We are also adding support for two additional blockchains, Stellar and Avalanche, enabling us to support four stablecoins running on four unique blockchains representing two currencies that we can then accept and convert to over 25 traditional fiat currencies across the world for our clients within our settlement infrastructure. There is so much more to come in this space, and we are excited about enabling commercial and money movement flows globally across networks, currencies, and form factors.
Now to value-added services, which had one of our strongest revenue growth quarters, up 26% year over year in constant dollars. Let me walk through some of the highlights in our four portfolios. In issuing solutions, Pismo continues to expand, benefiting from Visa Inc.'s deep client relationships and trusted partner status. We have now entered Europe with ABN AMROZ NeoBank boot in the Netherlands and have also partnered with Lunar, who serves over one million consumers and business users for the first Pismo-powered Visa Inc. card across Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.
This quarter, we signed with EML Payments in Australia to deploy Pismo for their global issuance strategy, enabling them to consolidate their multiple processing platforms to one across Australia, North America, the UK, and Europe. In Acceptance Solutions, we continue to grow through both direct relationships with merchants as well as with acquirers. I'll give two examples of each. First, direct with merchants. We renewed our agreement with Shopee Pay, a leading digital payments platform serving tens of millions of users, and expanded geographically from Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam to include the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, and also expanded with additional products such as tokenization.
Kareem Pay, part of Super App Careem that serves over 50 million customers across the Middle East and North Africa, will utilize several value-added services including CyberSource and account verification. On the acquiring side, in Saudi Arabia, Arab National Bank has selected Visa Inc. as their new partner for our CyberSource and risk solutions to offer to their merchant clients. We also signed with Bak, the largest acquirer in Central America, to provide CyberSource and tokenization to their merchant clients. In risk and security solutions, our feature space capabilities continue to resonate with our clients.
This quarter, TSYS, an existing and important partner of feature space, will begin transitioning their tens of billions of transactions to our next-gen SaaS platform so they can benefit from continued innovation in our advanced AI scoring models in a scalable way. Moving on to advisory and other services, where our payments, consulting and marketing experience, data and analytics capabilities, and sponsorships help us to deepen our relationships with our clients. For example, EON Financial Service, credit relationship and will be and will add consulting managed services and marketing services to help them grow. I'll call out two other examples of our consulting and marketing services at work.
In Brazil, our consulting and technical teams are working with Kaisha to help develop a super app for their over 40 million customers, enhancing digital engagement and loyalty. In the US, FinTech Shine utilized our marketing services capabilities to support their brand campaign during the NBA playoffs this past quarter. With each of these four portfolios growing at strong levels, value-added services remains a powerful engine of revenue growth for our business. In conclusion, our third-quarter results were strong. In Q3 and through July 21st, even with the continued uncertainty, consumer spending remains resilient. Within the US, while spending growth differed among consumer spend bands, all spend bands in Q3 remained resilient and consistent with past quarters.
Within spend categories in the US, we saw relative stability to Q2 when adjusted for leap year impacts. Both US discretionary and nondiscretionary spend growth remained strong, and we see no meaningful impact from tariffs. For cross-border, total volume growth excluding intra-Europe remains strong and above pre-COVID levels, even with continued impacts from currency weakness and travel to specific countries. While we're not immune to macroeconomic impacts, our business has proven to be diverse, resilient, and well-positioned to capture the significant opportunities ahead. We all know that as commerce evolves, so do buyer and seller preferences.
We have proven our ability to anticipate these changes and deploy solutions that enable our expanding network of partners to meet and exceed the needs of their users. Visa Inc. has become a hyperscaler that enables anyone around the world to access the breadth, scale, and resiliency of our network across more than 200 countries and territories, 150 currencies, and nearly five billion credentials. Anybody that wants to be in the money movement business or the payments business can build on top of the Visa Inc. stack.
And as we connect billions of buyers and sellers through seamless, secure digital payments, we're very excited about how that'll help us enable innovative commerce as we drive Visa Inc.'s growth forward well into the future. Now, I'll hand it over to Chris.
Chris Suh:
Thanks, Ryan. And good afternoon, everyone. Visa Inc. reached a record $10.2 billion in quarterly net revenue in our third quarter, up 14% year over year, better than expected, driven by lower incentives, a lower FX headwind, and higher value-added services revenue. Net revenue was also up 14% year over year in constant dollars. Underlying business drivers remained strong. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 8% year over year, and cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe was up 11% year over year. Total processed transactions grew 10% year over year. EPS was up 23% year over year in nominal and better than expected primarily due to the strength in net revenue growth. Let's go into the details.
Total international payments volume was up 10% year over year in constant dollars in Q3, relatively consistent with Q2 when adjusted for leap year. US payments volume driven by the with e-commerce growing faster than face-to-face spend. Credit was up 6% and debit was up 7%. When we look at US payments volume, year over year growth on a monthly basis, April was stronger than March, primarily due to Easter timing and some portfolio loss lapping, that continued throughout the quarter. May was relatively in line with April, and June was softer, primarily due to the impact of both days mix and bill pay timing.
Putting it all together, total Q3 US payments volume growth was generally consistent with Q2 adjusted for leap year. Now to cross-border volume. Which I'll speak to in constant dollars and excluding intra-Europe transactions. You may recall that we expected Q3 total cross-border volume growth to moderate from Q2 and be slightly below Q4 of FY2024, primarily due to the impacts of weaker currencies in certain countries, and the Canada to US travel corridor. In Q3, those impacts generally played out as we expected, with total cross-border volume year over year growth at 11%. E-commerce up 13% and travel up 9%. Even with some monthly variability.
April benefited from Easter and Ramadan timing, and May moderated from April without this timing benefit. In June, we saw the growth step down from May primarily due to further weakening of the US dollar, and a few smaller factors that largely reversed in July. As Ryan said, Visa Inc.'s Q3 total cross-border volume growth was strong, and remained above the pre-COVID trend. With that as a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results. Starting with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 9% year over year versus the 8% growth in Q2 constant dollar payments volume, helped by pricing, card benefits that more than offset exchange rate drag.
Data processing revenue grew 15% versus 10% in processed transaction growth, primarily due to pricing. International transaction revenue was up 14%, above the 11% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding intra-Europe, helped by elevated currency volatility and exchange rates, partially offset by hedging and mix. Other revenue grew 32% primarily driven by advisory and other value-added services, and pricing. Client incentives grew 13% lower than expected primarily due to two factors. First, deal timing, as we saw some expected deals shift out of Q3. Second, we expanded several client relationships, which led to updated incentive terms, and one-time reductions in the associated accruals. Now to our three growth engines.
Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth. Commercial and money movement solutions revenue grew 13% year over year in constant dollars. Commercial payments volume grew 7% year over year, accelerating slightly from Q2 adjusted for leap year, primarily due to the lapping of certain portfolio losses. Visa Direct transactions grew 25% year over year to 3.3 billion transactions with strength in both domestic and cross-border P2P. Value-added services revenue was $2.8 billion with growth accelerating to 26% year over year in constant dollars. This was driven by strength across all portfolios, and pricing.
Operating expenses grew 13% higher than expected, primarily due to a lower than expected FX benefit, and higher than expected personnel expenses. Non-operating income was $191 million, helped by investment income from higher cash balances. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%, in line with expectations. EPS was $2.98, up 23% over last year with minimal impacts from both exchange rates and acquisitions. During the quarter, we issued €3.5 billion of fixed-rate senior notes with maturities ranging between three and nineteen years, and interest rates from 2.25% to 3.875%. In addition, we bought back approximately $4.8 billion in stock and distributed $1.2 billion in dividends to our stockholders.
At the end of June, we had $29.8 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now let's move to what we've seen so far in Q4. Through July 21st, US payment volume was up 9%, with debit up 10%, and credit up 9% year over year. Even when adjusting for lapping the weather and technology outages, impacts from last July, we saw strong growth, primarily due to the timing of July 4th, the days mix impact that I mentioned for June, now helping July, and the timing of promotional shopping events. Processed transactions grew 11% year over year.
For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, total volume grew more than 10% year over year, with e-commerce up 13% and travel up 9%. July total cross-border volume growth accelerated more than a point from June as we saw improvement in both e-commerce and travel, primarily due to strong retail spend in e-commerce, the dollar strengthening versus certain currencies, and the reversal of a few smaller factors that impacted June. Now onto our expectations. Remember that adjusted basis is defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail.
For Q4, when we take the latest trends for business drivers in volatility, as well as our current view of deal timing, our adjusted net revenue expectations are unchanged in the high single digits to low double digits. On a nominal basis, this puts Q4 net revenue growth generally in line with the first half of FY2025 nominal net revenue growth, which was about 10%. Moving to adjusted operating expenses, which we expect to grow in the high single digits to low double digits. Non-operating income in the fourth quarter is expected to be minimal. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be between 18.5% and 19%.
As a result, we expect adjusted fourth-quarter EPS growth to be in the high single digits. For acquisition impacts, we expect a minimal benefit to net revenue growth, and approximately a 1.5-point contribution to operating expense growth and an approximate half-point headwind EPS growth in the fourth quarter. Pulling it all together for the full year, we have no changes to our full-year adjusted guidance except for non-operating income, which we expect to be about $250 million as a result of the third quarter.
However, it is important to note that when you incorporate our performance year to date, with our Q4 guidance, even though the full-year guidance ranges are unchanged, we now expect our net revenue growth and EPS growth to be stronger than previously anticipated. It's also a good reminder of the strength of Visa Inc.'s diverse business model, where in the face of changing conditions throughout the year, we still expect to deliver strong growth and leading profitability.
As we look ahead and plan for 2026, while we're contemplating a variety of economic scenarios, the strength and diversity of our business model that I just mentioned, the resilience of the consumer, and our clear and effective strategy together give us the confidence as we make investment decisions to build the future of payments and drive long-term growth. And now, Jennifer, it's time for some Q&A.
Jennifer Como:
Thanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions.
Operator:
Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one and clearly record your name. You will be announced prior to asking your question. To ensure all questioners are heard, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Once again, to ask a question, please press star one. To withdraw your question, please press star two. Our first question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. You may go ahead.
Harshita Rawat:
Hi. Good afternoon. Chris, I want to follow up on the fourth-quarter guide, if you can provide more color. Can you maybe help us kind of bridge the kind of deceleration from the third quarter? I know you talked about kind of FX volatility to some extent incentives. But anything else to call out also I think with regards to gross margin. Thank you.
Chris Suh:
Hi, Harshita. Yeah. So let's talk about Q4. We're expecting a fundamentally strong Q4 with strong drivers and continued resilient consumer spending. Now the guide reflects reported growth in Q4 that is being impacted by the lapping of some items that we spoke about last Q4. Specifically, there were one-time impacts that reduced incentives. The lowest growth quarter of last year. If you recall, Q4 last year grew 6% incentive. And also we had a very strong VAS quarter related to the Summer Olympics again last Q4. If you normalize for those lapping items, those one-time lapping items for Q4 growth digits. So that's sort of the absolute description of Q4. Now versus Q3, which was your specific question.
Q3 was a very strong quarter. Driven by strong drivers, higher currency volatility, strong VAS, and lower incentives as we talked about. And if I compare the two quarters, really, the big differences are going to be currency volatility, which was high in Q3, especially early in the quarter. Has settled down, and that's our assumption through the rest of Q4. The second one is incentives, where, again, Q3 benefited from one-time incentives that we talked about that I talked about in my prepared comments. And Q4 is anniversaring the benefits that we saw in incentives from a year ago. So normalized for those two things, Q3 is a strong quarter. Q4 is a strong quarter.
And when you add it up, we're going to finish very strong FY2025 higher than we thought entering the quarter.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next caller is Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.
Jennifer Como:
Hi, Tien-Tsin. Are you there?
Tien-Tsin Huang:
I am. Can you hear me, Jennifer? I'm sorry.
Jennifer Como:
Yeah. Now we can. Now we can.
Tien-Tsin Huang:
Okay. No. Thanks. And name is the hard one. Just want to maybe I'll ask on investment priorities if that's okay. I'm curious if that's changing at all given I know, Ryan, you talked a lot about AI and stablecoin to us. You're intro quarter. So I'm just curious if your priorities have changed because it does look like OPEX is running a little bit higher and fourth-quarter reported implies not that much operating leverage. So I'm just curious if you're changing some of your investments given some of the news, Genius Act. Etcetera.
Ryan McInerney:
Hi, Tien-Tsin. Let me talk about your question around priorities. And then I'm actually going to have Chris just talk briefly about OpEx because I think there's a very clear explanation that'll be helpful to you. Sure. In terms of priorities, no change from what I've been talking about publicly. You know, we have a deep and rich product pipeline. We feel great about the products that we put out into the market, both ones that we've deployed and the ones that we announced at our product drop in April. And, you know, we're always nipping and tucking in certain markets and adjusting. You know, kind of where we're going to go launch in this country versus that country.
But, no, overall, priorities remain the same. We feel great about the momentum that we have in the market and continue to drive that forward. But Chris, I think he was teed off a little bit by the OpEx part of his question. You want to just address OpEx?
Chris Suh:
Yeah. Let me address that. So I'll talk about Q3 and Q4. Q3 OpEx did come in a little higher than we anticipated. There was a couple of things. One was the FX benefit was less than expected. Then the second one, which I mentioned on the call, was higher personal costs. And just to click into that, specifically, the overage came from higher costs related to the mark to mark of the deferred compensation liability. But just for clarity, that's EPS neutral because we record the equivalent gain on that mark to market in NOI, and that contributed part to the NOI overperformance.
As far as Q4 goes, as Ryan talked about, we're investing in many things across our broad business to drive growth, and we're anticipating to grow OpEx in the high single digits to low double digits. We're doing all that investment and growing OpEx in line with revenue for Q4.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you. Our next caller is Trevor Williams with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.
Trevor Williams:
Great. Thanks very much. I wanted to go back to the spread between international transaction fees and the nominal cross-border volume. I think this quarter that spread was less than one point even though, Chris, you called out currency evolved being up pretty significantly year over year, and I think hedging and mix were the main offsets that were also mentioned. If you could just expand on both of those and then especially on mix, you guys have been clear about US inbound travel having slowed. I'm just curious how much of an impact that's having overall on the yield dynamic there. Thanks very much.
Chris Suh:
Yep. Sure, Trevor. Let's go into all the different components as you called out. Well, the two numbers that I'll reference is the 11% growth in total cross-border versus the 14% international. And as you point out, the spread shrinks on a nominal basis. So the three factors were higher currency volatility. We've talked about that at length. And then the other two items, hedging, which is in line with our strategy to mitigate cash flow impact of FX movements. And in this quarter, we had a hedging loss that offset a portion of the favorable impact of the weaker US dollar. And then the third one being mix. You mentioned Canada to US. That is a variable in here.
So across our business, the composition of our yields does can and does vary. Different clients, different regions, and that's the example I'll use. US inbound is one of our higher-yielding corridors. And that's being impacted by the Canada to the US volume. So the mix can certainly be an offset to the higher volatility. Those are the puts and takes for the quarter within that line specifically. But, you know, all in all, we're pleased again that revenue, whether it's in international or in data processing or service fee, we're outgoing volumes in all three categories.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Timothy Chiodo with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Chiodo:
Great. Thank you for taking the question. I want to see if we can dig in a little bit to Visa Direct. So on our estimates, it's becoming a more important part of the volume growth algorithm and particularly for debit. I wanted to see if we could hit two topics. One is some of the newer or faster growth use cases. One in particular that you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks around banks signing up to use Visa Direct as their cross-border platform. And then the second item I was hoping we could touch on is some of the pricing dynamics.
At the Investor Day, there was a slide that showed the roughly nine to ten cents yield on Visa Direct. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the pricing strategy there and to the extent that may or may not be evolving to maybe add some ad war room fees and whether or not that might have contributed at all to any of the strength in data processing. Thank you.
Ryan McInerney:
It's Ryan. I'll try to hit the high points of what you're asking there. For the question on Visa Direct. Love talking about Visa Direct. Comments, and we shared this at Investor Day as well. We now crossed the ten billion transaction mark at least on a rolling twelve months. Which we're very excited about. So I think you know, Visa Direct has really scaled in a meaningful way. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is the largest at-scale money movement platform in the world, however you want to measure it, whether it's endpoints or transactions or volumes or partners or what have you.
And, you know, the investments that we've made in that platform over time are what are helping our sales teams and client teams around the world sell into a lot of these new and exciting use cases. You mentioned the banks enabling and embedding Visa Direct as their cross-border money movement platform, that's something we've been very focused on. And we're having, you know, good success. And I believe there's a big opportunity here. I think there's a big opportunity for banks around the world to play a more direct role in money movement.
You know, when we're sitting and talking to our bank partners around the world, they often recognize that a lot of their users are leaving their bank app and maybe going to another fintech or another money movement platform to send remittances, for example. And they view that as a lost opportunity. And so they're using Visa Direct to power a remittance platform and a money movement platform and embed that in their app so that they can deepen their relationship with their users. Their users are getting more value from their financial institution, and ultimately driving more value as well. In terms of the pricing and the yield dynamics, it really differs.
You know, we price to value as we always talk about on this call. The competitive dynamics are different in every vertical and every use case, in every country around the world. We're going up against different competitors in some regions than we are in Latin America than we might be in Europe. And the pricing has different components to it as well. Just because we talked about the yield in cents per transaction, don't necessarily assume that reflects all the different pricing, whether it's the remittance topic that you asked about specifically or just Visa Direct in general.
We talked about it in that way because that's generally the right way that we think to think about the revenue dynamics is kind of what are we earning in cents per transaction. And you know, as we said during Investor Day, it's similar yields to what we're seeing in the debit business globally. So feeling good about all those fronts and the momentum that we have in the Visa Direct business.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you. Gus Gala with Maness Kraskehart. You may go ahead, sir.
Gus Gala:
Hey, Chris. Thank you for letting me on for the call. Street is currently looking for an acceleration in volume transaction for 2026. If we think of the macro kind of persisting from the June-July levels kind of there, and bank activity level kind of staying where it is. Is that kind of a realistic expectation? And then on the comments on the lower, there was a large peer by sort of commented on lower bank activity levels. You mentioned deal timing being moved back in prep remarks.
Any part of the stack or transaction where that's maybe happening within that or parts of that's more acute, and granted you guys still accelerating in the quarter, but just any color around that would be very helpful. Thanks.
Ryan McInerney:
Why don't I take the second part of the question on VAS and then you can address the first part of the question, which I think was a question. You've gone in a little in and out, so sorry to I think it was a question around 2026. We really feel great about the VAS. As you heard in both my and Chris' prepared remarks, you know, firing on all cylinders across all of the different businesses. Maybe just as a reminder in terms of how we're thinking about the overall VAS strategy, I think you're seeing the results of that strategy now. You know, we've been focusing our VAS business for a long time about enhancing Visa Inc. transactions.
Making Visa Inc. payments safer, simpler, easier, more reliable. And you know, that has been historically how we've generated most of the VAS revenue that we generated. Where we've really seen a lot of success is in the two additional strategic levers that we talked about. The second is putting our VAS to work enabling all different types of payments. Other card payments, account-to-account payments, digital wallet payments, partnering with RTP networks around the world and digital wallet players, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the partnership that we have in Brazil to power PICS payments.
So, you know, we're really starting to see a lot of momentum in this second leg of the strategy by putting our VAS to work to enable all different types of payments. And then the third area, which is really going beyond payments, and helping our clients with a whole range of things from marketing to managed services to strategy to analytics to data. And there too, in my prepared remarks, you heard a lot of great examples from all around the world of the success we're having in that area.
So you know, good progress, good momentum, and you're starting to see kind of the strategy that we talked about a couple of years ago really start to come through in the performance and the numbers. And then, Chris, I think there was a question about 2026.
Chris Suh:
Yeah. Let me comment on 2026. Obviously, we're focused on closing Q4 and finishing FY2025 strong, but we are also in the planning phases for FY2026. And broadly, we see tremendous opportunity across our three growth engines, consumer payments, CMS, and VAS. And as we think about 2026, we're evaluating several drivers and parameters, including various macroeconomic scenarios, expected client renewals, and pricing in both the card present and card not present environment. As well as the investments we want to make to build the future payments. Now we'll have a lot more to say about 2026, in our next earnings call.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.

Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Will Nance:
Hey, guys. You got all the way to me here without getting disabled on question. So I'll ask one on the remittance space, which you guys called out as a potential use case. Could you talk a little bit about how you see what the role of stablecoins in that space? Is it on the pricing side, the settlement side? And do you expect the value of the role that stablecoins play to accrue to the service providers in that space, or do you expect it to accrue to the consumers in the form of lower pricing? Thank you.
Ryan McInerney:
Thanks, Will. Lot in there. And as you know, it's early days, but we see a lot of opportunity specifically in remittances. And as I said in my prepared remarks, more broadly in cross-border whether it's, you know, P2P or B2B. So let me hit a couple of points. First is Visa Direct. Visa Direct, as you know, is our remittance platform. And it is a network of networks that enables money movement all around the world in lots of different currencies. You know, we're able to push money and, you know, to I think it's 14 billion different endpoints now, whether it's cards, wallets, or bank accounts.
And for some of those use cases and some of those corridors, the money movement and transactions are near instant. But sometimes, you know, for example, sending money from a Visa Inc. card to a bank account in an emerging market, we're reliant on local banking infrastructure. So in these types of use cases, stablecoins could enable us to have faster cross-border transactions. That's, by the way, that's true for consumers or for businesses. And we've been testing that out and having some good results. You know, we've been testing a series of corridors and putting stablecoins to work directly versus the fiat currency money movement options that we're able to deliver to our clients and their users today.
And at this point, we've got a pretty good sense on which corridors we can provide faster money movement, cheaper money movement, which ultimately is, you know, value, I think, that'll accrue both to end users and to our clients. So, you know, we're working through all of those things. I do think as I said in my prepared remarks, that there is real product market fit for stablecoins in remittances for certain corridors. And, you know, as the largest money movement platform around the world, we're going to be an early adopter of a lot of those things on behalf of our clients and their end users.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you. Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead.
Darrin Peller:
Hey. Thanks, guys. Could we just touch on number one, the pricing dynamic that we're seeing in data processing and the spread between growth on revenue and volume obviously strong. Just maybe explain a little more of what's going on behind it, where you're seeing the value on raising price there and just the timing on it. Is it sustainable? And then just to revisit incentives also on timing also. Because I think this year, fiscal 2025 was supposed to be a higher year of renewals. I think you had talked about 20% of the book something along those lines versus the norm, more like 15%.
So that's still the case, and do we expect that to be more normalized next year? Thanks, guys.
Chris Suh:
I'll take both of these, Darrin. So pricing, you know, again, I'm going to go back to some of the things that we said earlier in this year. When we entered this year, we said the pricing benefit in FY2025 is going to be similar to FY2024. But the timing would be more back half-weighted. And if you recall in Q1 and Q2, when we were having these conversations about revenue versus yield, pricing was less benefit than we might typically see and have one consistent with that timing of pricing. And so now pricing back half-loaded, we're having a more concentrated impact in Q3 and Q4, and that's really sort of what's happening.
And so it's great that we see, you know, revenue outperforming volumes. On data processing and a number of other spots. In terms of your second part of your question, around the amount of volume of deals and deal timing, you are correct. 2025 is a bigger year for renewals than 2024. You quoted the 20% number. We still believe 20% of our PV is impacted this year above the 15% last year. It's just more deal activity. And, you know, as you know, the deals are long in duration, increasingly more expansive, which inherently brings the level of complexity.
These are important deals, and so sometimes they take a long time to get right, and we're going to take the time to get them right. The good news is we feel really good about the success we're having renewing and expanding our client partnerships. But as you can see, the timing can vary a bit from quarter to quarter.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Fahad Kunwar with Rothschild and Co Redburn. You may go ahead.
Fahad Kunwar:
Hi, both. Thanks for all the answers to the question. Super helpful. I had one more on incentives, if you don't mind. If I go back a little further, you know, incentive growth as a percentage of revenue has been going up about a percentage point a year for the best part of ten years. It does feel like in the last kind of year and a half, is it stabilized or at least in the last year 28% level? I know you talk about renewal cycles now, but is this an inflection point?
Now do we think that incentive growth now broadly runs in line with revenues, and that kind of trend line up has kind of inflected to be flat? Or is there something else we're missing or some other change that as to why we might see an inflection, like, upwards to that old growth rate? Thanks.
Chris Suh:
Sure. I'll take this one as well. No. I mean, it's just honestly not the way that we think about our business. You know, this is consistent with the way we've been talking about net rev growth, and that's our focus. We're growing volumes, we're growing net revenues along with our partners. And incentives are simply a tool for us to achieve mutual goals. And it does get impacted, of course, by the volume of expirations and renewals, and it can vary from year to year, but I certainly am not going to comment on sort of the relationship between those two. We're driving net revenue growth and driving volumes, and that's the most important thing.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Nate Spence with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nate Spence:
Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to talk a little more about cross-border trends, especially travel. I know you guys color in the prepared remarks, but it looks like we've had a couple of soft months here in June, maybe a little bit of recovery in July month to date. Hoping you can give an update on what you're seeing specifically in international travel in your book a bit business, maybe what bookings look like, what impact recent FX moves are doing to consumer demand, etcetera. And then anything to call out on specific corridors? I know we talked about inbound US from Canada, but anything like Europe to US or any other changing July month to date?
Chris Suh:
Sure. Okay. Let's talk cross-border. And this one, you know, we'll sort of try to break into a fair level of detail, so bear with me. Just starting from the top just so we have sort of a complete picture, cross-border growth in Q3 as we reported 11% that's excluding intra-Europe and constant dollar. Largely in line with the directional expectations that we had set. At the beginning of the quarter. We did see variation from month to month for the factors that we talked about, holiday, timing of Easter, Ramadan, weakness in currency, US to Canada, all those things that we had anticipated through the to happen in Q3 much of it did play out.
We did see the US dollar weaken further, which have impacted the June month as well. And then obviously, in July, you referenced this as well. We've seen it accelerate more than a point from June. And we've seen that improvement in both travel and e-commerce related, we believe, due to the dollar strengthening again in July versus certain currencies. But, also, we see strong retail spend in e-commerce and the reversal of some of the few of the smaller factors that we referenced in June. So obviously, the growth rates month to month, it's a little bit fluid.
And we're likely to see it continue to be fluid as long as we continue to see currency exchange movements at the speed and pace that we're seeing it. But we also don't believe circumstances like the current Canada, the US corridor are permanent structural changes either. And so we could see some strengthening there. Or we could see further, you know, sort of impact from sentiment around the world. In specific to corridors, which is the second part of your question, I'll give a few examples. We've talked extensively about Canada, the US, that's remaining relatively consistent. US outbound, you know, historically, that's been very sensitive to the strength of the or weakness of the US dollar.
And with the recent weakening US outbound, we believe has been impacted in a correlated way. AP currency has remained weak as well. And has continued to remain weak and across a number of markets in AP, and that's impacting travel there as well. And then, of course, the timing of various holidays, Easter, which had a larger impact in Europe, in Ramadan, of course, had a larger impact in Sumia. Those are some of the things that we're seeing from a corridor standpoint.
But again, if we zoom out of the month to month and we look at cross-border in total, the overall level, the data, the trends, you know, and we understand sort of the currency impacts that can have that can be that can show up, cross-border volume we think in total, has remained strong and above pre-COVID levels.
Jennifer Como:
Last question, please, Michelle.
Operator:
Thank you. Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. You may go ahead, sir.
Sanjay Sakhrani:
Thank you. Had a bigger picture of Stablecoin question. Totally understand that Visa Inc. can add Stablecoins to its suite of payment methods. Link it to its product and services and acceptance network. But I guess if we pull up on the long runway to tap into the large revenue TAM and payments, Ryan, do you think stablecoins dilute that, or do you think it keeps it the same? Does it add to it? When does it become a material contributor in your review? And by the way, those chime ads during the NBA playoffs are pretty good.
Ryan McInerney:
Thanks. Go back to the product market fit that I described. If you agree with that, which clearly I do, I think it's a lot of opportunity for us. And why do I say that? The first, on the emerging markets use cases, the bulk of those markets around the world are very cash-rich markets. The bulk of those markets around the world are markets where we haven't been as successful digitizing cash as we have in more mature markets.
And so to the extent that stablecoins get adopted in a broad-based way by both consumers and businesses, and assuming that we are able to continue to have success with our playbook of making Visa Inc. cards the preferred way for people who have stablecoins in those markets to pay for things, I think that could accelerate our progress digitizing consumer payments and business small business and commercial payments in those markets. The second, you know, product market area product market fit that I mentioned was cross-border.
And as you know, well, the cross-border TAM in terms of whether it's remittances or B2B money movement, those are enormous TAMs that we're still relatively low in terms of our penetration of those well. And so I think to the extent that we can do the types of things I was mentioning in the question that Will asked earlier, for remittances on our Visa Direct platform, you know, that's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to expand and accelerate our growth in remittances.
So, you know, I'm genuinely optimistic about what stablecoins could do to accelerate our progress digitizing flows, whether it's consumer payments or opportunities in CMS and, you know, we'll continue to update you as we learn more.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Ryan McInerney:
Thanks, Jennifer. We finished fiscal full year 2025 with strong financial performance, and an ever-growing obsession for our clients, and a sharp focus on innovation as we build the future of payments. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue grew 12% year over year to $10.7 billion, and EPS was up 10%, resulting in full year net revenue and EPS year over year growth of 11% and 14%, respectively. Total full year payments volume was $14 trillion, up 8% year over year in constant dollars, and processed transactions totaled $258 billion, up 10% year over year.
Our financial performance and growth demonstrate how Visa has become a hyperscaler, enabling anyone that wants to be in the money movement or payments business to build on top of the Visa as a Service stack. You may recall the layers of the stack: the foundation layer, the services layer, the solutions layer, and the access layer. Throughout 2025 and most recently in Q4, we have intensified our investment in innovation. Today, I want to highlight Visa's progress with our clients and the ecosystem at large across the Visa as a Service stack, starting with the foundation layer.
At the foundation of the stack is our global connectivity, our network, and our network of networks that enable global commerce and money movement. In full year 2025, we expanded our network of networks in three important ways. First, more connection points. Visa's network of networks now has approximately 12 billion endpoints. That's about 4 billion cards, bank accounts, and digital wallets each. Second, more settlement currencies. We are adding support for four stablecoins running on four unique blockchains representing two currencies that we can accept and convert to over 25 traditional fiat currencies. And third, we have begun deployment of the next generation of VisaNet.
The core processing platform in our Visa as a Service stack offers a cloud-ready, microservices distributed modular architecture that uses open languages and technologies, enabling easier scaling, configuration, and faster feature deployment. Over half of the new code base was built with the assistance of generative AI, improving development speed, security, and maintainability. We have specific modules in market today, with plans to roll out additional modules and markets. The next level of the Visa as a Service stack is our services layer, which encompasses the building blocks of our core capabilities, including credentials, tokens, authentication, risk management, fraud detection, and more, which we've turned into discrete modular components.
We grew the number of Visa credentials by 270 million this year, and we continued to sign many deals this past quarter to drive further growth. I'll share a few regional highlights. We are pleased to have renewed our nearly sixty-year relationship with Barclays in the UK and the US across their millions of customers in consumer and commercial issuing and acquiring, and enabling increased focus on value-added services utilization. In the US, Visa continues to be the exclusive payment network for the Southwest Airlines co-brand program, and we will soon be expanding our relationship into a co-brand debit offering, providing customers a new way to earn rapid rewards points on everyday purchases.
In Latin America, we won the new Scotiabank Wealth Management credit card issuance with our Visa Infinite product across seven countries. And in Mainland China, one of our largest clients, China Merchants Bank, has renewed their long-standing relationship with us as we continue to upgrade China's MagStripe dual-branded cards to contactless EMV chip cards. Moving to tokens, we now have over 16 billion Visa tokens, up from 10 billion just in May 2024. We continue to increase the amount of Visa tokens globally in pursuit of our ultimate goal of 100% of e-commerce transactions tokenized.
We continue to enhance our risk management capabilities, including Visa scam disruption, which proactively detects scam activity at the network level that no single issuer, acquirer, or merchant could see alone and leverages AI-enhanced merchant monitoring, external intelligence feeds, and our global expertise. Just a year since launch, we have worked closely with our clients and law enforcement to dismantle more than 25,000 scam merchants representing more than $1 billion in fraud attempts. Our stablecoin platform is another key component of our services layer.
Since 2020, we facilitated over $140 billion in crypto and stablecoin flows, including Visa users purchasing more than $100 billion of crypto and stablecoin assets using their Visa credentials, and spending more than $35 billion in crypto and stablecoin assets using Visa credentials. Within this, we see particular momentum with stablecoins. We now have more than 130 stablecoin-linked card issuing programs in over 40 countries, and in Q4, stablecoin-linked Visa card spend quadrupled versus a year ago. We expanded the number of stablecoins and blockchains available for settlement, and monthly volume has now passed a $2.5 billion annualized run rate.
We are starting to enable banks to mint and burn their own stablecoins with the Visa tokenized asset platform, and we are adding stablecoin capabilities to enhance cross-border money movement with Visa Direct. In September 2025, we announced a stablecoin prefunding Visa Direct pilot targeting banks, remitters, and financial institutions seeking faster, more flexible ways to manage liquidity. And there is much more to come in this space. The next level of the Visa as a Service stack is our solutions layer. A comprehensive portfolio of solutions where we have taken the componentized capabilities from the services layer and invested in and enhanced them to create new features and capabilities we deliver to a broader array of customers and partners.
If we look across our growth levers in this layer, I would note progress in a number of areas. In consumer payments, Visa Intelligent Commerce integrates Visa's token technology with authentication and predictive analytics, empowering partners to deploy secure, personalized digital commerce experiences. And I'm pleased to announce that we are now powering live agentic transactions and recently released a merchant agent toolkit to make it easy for developers to embed our solutions into workflows and agentic processes. Just two weeks ago, we announced the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol. A framework that enables safer agent-driven checkout by helping merchants verify agents and avoid malicious bots. And since it's built on existing messaging standards, minimal integration is required for merchants.
Next, our Visa Flex credential continues to gain momentum, enabling consumers to access many underlying funding sources with a single credential powered by Visa token technology. For example, the 15 European markets building on its success in the US, where it had over 1 million sign-ups in less than three months, and they will expand to even more markets soon. Our Visa Flex pipeline is strong, and we now have more than 20 signed clients in more than 20 countries across all regions, including our first Visa Flex announcement in LAC, with Nico. Our Visa accept solution enables even the smallest of sellers to accept card payments with just a Visa debit card and an NFC-capable smartphone.
Our first live launch of Visa except was in Sri Lanka, which represents an opportunity to bring an estimated 7 million sellers onto the Visa network, most of which are informal sellers who primarily transact in cash today. And this is just our first launch. We are targeting 25 countries across several regions where we expect to launch Visa except soon, with even more expansion to follow. Our Visa Pay solution connects any participating wallet to any Visa-accepting seller worldwide, local or international, in-store or online. We are pleased to now be processing live Visa Pay transactions in four markets across AP and CEMEA, including our recently announced market launch in the Democratic Republic Of Congo.
In addition, we have a pipeline with more than 70 clients to expand across more markets in 2026 and beyond. Rounding out consumer payments is tapped to everything. 79% of all face-to-face transactions are taps, up eight percentage points this year, with the US at 66%. Our transit initiatives contributed to this expansion, and this year we enabled more than 100 new transit systems to now total approximately 1,000 systems globally, delivering 19% year-over-year growth in transactions. In Europe, BBVA recently launched BBVA Pay, enabling tapping from an iOS device for all Visa cards within their banking app. They also have enabled customers to use AI to create their own personalized Visa cards, starting in Spain.
Tap to phone, which provides an easy, low-cost method for micro sellers to begin accepting card payments or large sellers to add additional mobile terminals, has now passed 20 million transacting devices, more than doubling since last year, with strong growth across all regions. And tap to add card, launched a little over a year ago, has strong adoption as consumers and our partners see the value of a simplified, more secure customer experience where a simple card tap to a mobile device can add a Visa credential to a digital wallet.
Since Q3, we have doubled the count of issuers participating globally to more than 600 across all regions, resulting in the service being live for more than 1.4 billion Visa credit and debit cards around the world. Shifting to CMS, and starting with Visa Commercial Solutions, our full year 2025 commercial payments volume grew 7% in constant dollars to $1.8 trillion. This was helped by targeting specific segments, including business owners and online travel agencies. In the premium card segment, we supported Chase with the launch of Chase Sapphire Reserve for business on Visa Infinite. An expansion of the Sapphire Reserve product line.
The Sapphire Reserve for Business Card is designed to meet the needs of business owners by elevating their travel experience and offering premium benefits and value toward business services to help fuel their growth. And also in the US, we are excited to have partnered with Truist to launch the Truist Business Premium Visa Infinite Card, a premium credit card designed for small businesses with meaningful annual spend. They are the first super regional to do so in this country. Our purpose-built travel solution offers virtual card credentials, automated reconciliation, and rich data. We recently won trip.com's Global Virtual travel card issuing business, which will be issued through their FinTech Triplink.
In our traditional carded business, our global network-agnostic enhanced spend management capabilities have helped us to expand our partnership with BMO. We recently won new commercial issuance, and BMO will offer our Spend Clarity for Enterprise tool to their corporates in the US and Canada. Our unique FX capabilities enabled us to win a de novo issuing relationship with ICICI Bank for India's first corporate Forex prepaid card, targeting both SMBs and large corporates to meet foreign exchange payment needs for business travel. In fact, in India, Visa SMB cards have doubled since 2020 and now total more than 10 million, helping us to grow total commercial cards to $340 million worldwide.
Moving on to Visa Direct, which reached 12.6 billion transactions in full year 2025, up 27% year over year. Our push to account and wallet funding capabilities continue to help us to expand cross-border payouts. We signed with KCB in East Africa, where they will use Visa Direct to Account for eight corridors across their more than 30 million individual and business customers. Touch and Go e-wallet, the largest wallet in Malaysia with more than 24 million users, will leverage Visa Direct to enable tourists to fund their wallets across eight corridors.
And Al Raji, a leading remitter with the largest branch network in The Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia, expanded on its Visa Direct to card usage to now include Visa Direct to account. And our interoperability capabilities unlocked through our Yellow Pepper acquisition enabled us to renew with Yape and Plin, securing our position as the leader for interoperable transactions in Peru. Now moving to Value Added Services. We have seen our innovations across issuing, acceptance, risk, and advisory continue to power our growth. We've achieved our goal to expand PISMO's offerings to clients in more than five countries across four regions in 2025.
In the fourth quarter, we signed our first PISMO deal for a stablecoin-linked card with Gnosis Pay in Europe. In Acceptance Solutions, our Token Management Service, or TMS, provides a single network and payment service provider agnostic integration to simplify token adoption, access, and management for merchants and acquiring clients. This quarter, we signed with booking.com for TMS and Account Updater across more than 65 markets, deepening our presence in the online travel platform space. Many of our risk and security solutions are also network agnostic. Let me highlight a few points of progress.
Visa advanced authorization evaluates more than 400 unique attributes in a few milliseconds, and this quarter Banco diners in Ecuador deployed our network-agnostic solution to score both Visa and non-Visa transactions, the first bank in LAC to do so. Our award-winning product Visa Protect for A2A is delivering value with AI. Our pilot in Brazil scored nearly $500 billion of our bank partners' picks volume over a six-month period and identified over $90 million of fraud, which could have been prevented. With a detection rate of more than 80%.
We believe Visa Protect for A2A can play an important role in Brazil by providing real-time fraud monitoring on PIKs, helping to reduce fraud for our bank partners and ensure a safer payment experience for buyers and sellers. Our most recently acquired risk capabilities from Feature Space are being sought after by our clients, with more than 100 closed client deals since January. And our advisory services continued to deliver revenue and deepen our client relationships across Visa. In consulting, we estimate that we help clients realize over $6.5 billion of incremental revenue as a result of delivering almost 4,500 engagements during the year, including Gen AI and Stablecoin engagements.
In Marketing Services, our flagship sponsorships include the FIFA World Cup 2026 in the US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in Milano Cortina. We are already seeing significant interest from our clients as they seek to offer unique cardholder experiences and build their brand in addition to helping drive issuance, acceptance, and engagement. One Olympic and Paralympic-related marketing example was our first large-scale campaign created using generative AI tools for Intesa Sanpaolo, which showcased a ski race down the streets of Italy's seaside villages.
We already have over 35 clients engaged with us for marketing services for the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and more than 70 for the FIFA World Cup 2026, with more than 100 already in our pipeline. The fourth and final layer of the Visa as a Service stack on top of the foundation layer, the services layer, and the solutions layer is the access layer. The client entry point to access Visa solutions. We take an open partnership approach, seeking to provide value by enabling access to our Visa as a Service stack through multiple integration methods, including custom integrations, programmatic access via APIs, and structured data exchange through our model context protocol or MCP server.
We remained the payments platform of choice in full year 2025, with more than 700 billion API calls across our more than 3,700 endpoints. And we recently launched our MCP server, providing access for AI systems to interface with our Visa Intelligent Commerce APIs. Our open flexible access layer enables anyone, whether a small business, a tech partner, or a global bank, to build on top of the Visa as a Service stack and operate at scale instantly. In conclusion, you can see our intense focus on innovation is delivering results for Visa and our clients. The Visa as a Service stack has positioned Visa to be a hyperscaler for the payments ecosystem.
Our strong fiscal year 2025 performance is a result of our products resonating in the market, and our commitment to our clients every day. I want to thank our more than 34,000 employees around the world who will continue to obsess about our clients and work tirelessly in 2026 and beyond to deliver value through the Visa as a Service stack to our clients and across our partner ecosystem. We live in remarkable times in payments. As technologies are converging to reshape commerce, and at Visa, with our clients, partners, sellers, and consumers, we are keeping our focus on innovation and product development, positioning Visa to lead this transformation.
Now to Chris, where he will discuss our financial performance and outlook for 2026.
Chris Suh:
Thanks, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Building on the momentum we saw through the first three quarters, we had a very good Q4 to finish the year with continued strong and stable business drivers. In constant dollars, global payments volume was up 9% year over year, improving slightly from Q3. Cross-border volume excluding intra-Europe was up 11%, and total processed transactions grew 10%, both relatively stable to Q3. Fiscal fourth quarter net revenue was 12% year over year, better than expected, primarily due to value-added services revenue, commercial and money movement solutions revenue, and a benefit from FX. Fourth quarter net revenue was up 11% in constant dollars.
EPS was up 10% year over year in both nominal and constant dollars, better than expected, primarily due to better-than-expected net revenue. Let's go into the details. Total international payments volume was up 10% year over year in constant dollars in Q4, generally consistent with Q3. Of note, we saw acceleration in Asia Pacific, of approximately 2.5 points on a constant dollar basis, driven by timing effects and a modest improvement in Mainland China. US Payments volume was up 8%, slightly above Q3, with e-commerce growing faster than face-to-face spend. Credit and debit were both up 8%, reflecting resilience in consumer spending.
When we look at quarterly spend category data in the US, we saw broad-based strength, including improvements in retail services and goods, travel, and fuel. Both discretionary and non-discretionary spend were up from Q3. Growth across consumer spend bands remained relatively consistent with Q3, with the highest spend band continuing to grow the fastest. Now to cross-border volume, which I'll speak to in constant dollars, and excluding intra-Europe transactions. Q4 total cross-border volume was up 11% year over year, relatively stable to last quarter, with e-commerce up 13% and travel improving sequentially to 10%. E-commerce remained strong as it has for the last eight quarters now and still represented about 40% of our total cross-border volume.
Travel spend continued to grow above pre-COVID levels. The slight step up from Q3 was led by a combination of factors, including increased commercial volumes, helped by our efforts in virtual card and some improvement in CEMEA outbound to holiday timing. With that as a backdrop, I'll move to discuss our financial results, starting with the revenue components. Service revenue grew 10% year over year versus the 8% growth in Q3 constant dollars payments volume, primarily due to card benefits and pricing. Data processing revenue grew 17% versus the 10% growth in processed transactions, primarily due to pricing and higher cross-border transaction mix.
International transaction revenue was up 10%, below the 11% increase in constant dollar cross-border volume growth excluding intra-Europe, primarily due to mix partially offset by exchange rates. Other revenue grew 21%, primarily driven by growth in advisory and other value-added services, and pricing. Client incentives grew 17%, in line with our expectations as we lapped one-time adjustments from 2024. Now to our three growth engines. Consumer payments revenue was driven by strong payments volume, cross-border volume, and processed transaction growth. Commercial and Money Movement Solutions revenue grew 14% year over year in constant dollars as we lap the one-time adjustment we saw in Q4 FY 2024. CMS revenue was better than expected, driven primarily by our Commercial Solutions business.
Commercial payments volume grew 10% in constant dollars, three points above Q3 growth and faster than Visa's overall payments volume growth, primarily due to new portfolio wins and the lapping of certain portfolio losses. With strong client performance, especially in cross-border. Visa Direct transactions grew 23% to 3.4 billion transactions, with strength in both domestic and cross-border. Value-added services revenue grew 25% in constant dollars to $3 billion, driven by issuing solutions, advisory and other services, and pricing. Value-added services revenue growth was better than expected, primarily due to issuing solutions, both in network products and card benefits.
Operating expenses grew 13%, above our expectations due to larger-than-expected FX impact and higher-than-expected personnel expenses as a result of deferred compensation mark to market, which as a reminder is EPS neutral. Excluding those two factors, adjusted operating expense growth would have been as expected. Non-operating income was $29 million higher than expected due to investment income from the deferred compensation mark to market benefit that offsets the expense I just mentioned and higher returns on our investments. Our tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, in line with expectations. EPS was $2.98, up 10% year over year with minimal impacts from exchange rates and acquisitions.
In Q4, we bought back approximately $4.9 billion in stock and distributed $1.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. We also funded the litigation escrow account by $500 million, which has the same effect on EPS as a stock buyback. At the end of September, we had $24.9 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. With a strong finish to the fiscal year, our full year net revenue grew 11% to $40 billion, and EPS grew 14% to $11.47. Full year 2025 CMS revenue growth was 15%, and value-added services revenue growth was 23% on a constant dollar basis. In a year marked by a significant step up in uncertainty around the globe, we delivered strong results above our expectations.
As we think about 2026, our guidance philosophy holds. We give you our best perspective based on current information. So let's get into the guidance details. And a quick note, when I referenced 2025 and 2026, I am referring to our fiscal years. First, let's cover our underlying assumptions for net revenue growth. As we regularly say, we are not economic forecasters. So we're assuming the macroeconomic environment stays generally where it is today and consumer spending remains resilient. On key business drivers, we are assuming no material change from the Q4 2025 growth levels in 2026.
On pricing, for 2026, we expect the benefits of new pricing to be similar in magnitude and timing as in 2025, with the majority going into effect in the back half. When you combine that with the 2025 pricing timing, this implies a relatively uniform contribution each quarter, with Q1 seeing the largest contribution. On incentives, we expect around 20% of our payments volume to be impacted by renewals this year, which implies incentive growth generally similar to 2025, with Q3 having the toughest comparable to 2025.
On volatility, we expect volatility throughout the year to be generally consistent with where we exited Q4, which implies a drag for the first three quarters, with Q3 having the toughest comparable to 2025. We pull these assumptions together on an adjusted basis, defined as non-GAAP results in constant dollars and excluding acquisition impacts. You can review these disclosures in our earnings presentation for more detail. In 2026, we expect full year adjusted net revenue growth to be in the low double digits. On a nominal basis, we expect an approximately half-point benefit from FX, which implies nominal net revenue growth that is generally consistent with fiscal 2025, which was 11%.
We have an exciting year with the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Q2 and the FIFA World Cup in Q3 and Q4. I'll speak to expense in a moment, but as far as net revenue impacts, we expect the benefit from value-added services to be spread throughout the year, as our clients will utilize our solutions in the buildup to and during the events. In terms of quarterly variability of net revenue, two items I would call out. First, we expect Q1 to have the highest year-over-year net revenue growth rate, primarily due to the timing impact of our FY 2025 pricing actions.
Second, we expect Q3 to have the lowest year-over-year net revenue growth rate, primarily due to the lapping impacts of strong volatility and lower-than-expected incentives in 2025. Now moving to expenses. We expect to continue our significant investments in our Visa as a Service stack across consumer payments, commercial and money movement solutions, and value-added services in FY 2026. Let me share a few examples. Within consumer payments, we will enhance our cross-border and affluent offerings, scale recently launched products, and expand our stablecoin capabilities. In addition to utilizing our marketing dollars for both the Olympics and FIFA to amplify the Visa brand.
Within CMS, we'll focus our investments in specific commercial vertical opportunities and build out new Visa Direct product capabilities focused on cross-border money movement. And within BaaS, we'll invest in our product development as well as our sales engineering teams to deepen customer engagement and shorten deal cycles. In addition, we're also investing in our AI efforts. In fact, every leader at the company has AI targets to drive efficiencies that we intend to invest back in the business to further our differentiation, competitive advantage, and drive long-term growth. We currently expect to grow adjusted operating expense in the low double digits, consistent with our net revenue growth.
As we think about the cadence of spend, we expect Q2 and Q3 to have the largest year-over-year growth rates as a result of marketing expense related to the Olympics and FIFA. Now moving to non-operating income. The non-operating income we've had for the past three years has been a function of cash balances, interest rates, and one-time items. In 2026, based on current interest rate forward curves, we now expect non-operating expense of $125 to $175 million. Now to our non-GAAP tax rate. You may recall that we've historically estimated our long-term tax rate to be between 19-20%, and this remains unchanged.
In both fiscal 2024 and 2025, our actual tax rate was below 18%, helped primarily by our geographic mix of earnings and certain one-time benefits, such as the resolution of tax matters and positions taken on certain taxes. In 2026, we still expect to be below our long-term tax rate. When we incorporate our current tax planning strategies, we expect the tax rate to be between 18.5-19%, up from 2024 and 2025, primarily due to the absence of one-time benefits. On capital return, the Board has declared an increase to our quarterly dividend by 14%, and we intend to return excess free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks.
All of this results in our adjusted EPS growth to be in the low double digits. Moving to Q1, through October 21, with volume growth in constant dollars, US Payments volume was up 7%, with credit and debit both up 7%. Processed transactions grew 9% year over year. For constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, total volume grew 12% year over year, with e-commerce up 14% and travel up 11%. Now on to our financial expectations. We expect Q1 adjusted net revenue growth in the high end of low double digits. We expect adjusted operating expense growth in the low double digits.
Non-operating expense is expected to be about $15 million, and our tax rate in the first quarter is expected to be around 18%. As a result, we expect adjusted first quarter EPS growth to be in the low teens. When we look on a nominal basis, for net revenue growth in Q1, we expect an approximately half-point benefit from FX. And for our expense growth, we expect an approximately 0.5 drag from FX and a one-point impact from acquisitions, which taken together result in nominal net revenue and expense growth that are more matched at the high end of low double digits.
As always, if the environment changes, and there are events that impact our business, we will remain flexible and thoughtful on balancing short and long-term considerations. Visa's underlying business continues to be healthy, and the growth opportunities are significant, together giving us conviction as we make investment decisions to build the future of payments, to drive compelling net revenue and earnings per share growth. And now Jennifer, I'll hand it back to you.
Jennifer Como:
Thanks, Chris. And with that, we're ready to take questions. Thank you. Prior to asking your question to ensure all questionnaires are ... . Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.
Sanjay Sakhrani:
Thank you. Like the outlook, it's very strong. I guess when I think through some of the assumptions that are embedded in it, I know, Chris, you talked about assuming the macro stable, but we've heard some of your competitors talk about choppiness in the economy, different spending habits, especially for consumers as they've been trading down on discretionary items. I mean, have you guys seen anything like that? And sort of how does that factor into your outlook? Thank you.
Chris Suh:
Hi, Sanjay. Yeah. We have great momentum exiting FY '25, and that's the underlying assumption as we go into '26 for another strong year. Let me address some of the specific points you made about questions you had around sort of, I guess, spend, and the strength of the macro economy. I mean, if I just zoom out a little bit, really one of the real strengths of our business here, Visa, is the diversification of our business. And so we have the broadest exposure to credit, to debit. Our volumes are comprised of everyday spend to special occasion spend, nondiscretionary like fuel and groceries, and discretionary items like travel or holidays, goods, services, consumer, commercial.
And so really some of the broadest spend categories that you can imagine. And what we do is we remain data-driven. And across this broad and diverse set, the growth across our spend bands has remained quite consistent all year, and it was again in Q4, with higher spending cardholders driving more of the growth. And that's consistent with what we see across the US economy. And so that all gives us good reason when we reason over that data to say the consumer has remained resilient. That is what we saw in FY 25, and that is our assumption going into FY '26.
Jennifer Como:
Next question please.
Operator:
Thank you. James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
James Faucette:
Great. Thank you very much. Really appreciate all the work that you guys are doing on new initiatives, etcetera. One that's quite topical obviously is all things agentic commerce. And I know you've had some recent announcements on that topic. Do you know paint a picture for us like the role that you expect Visa to play in agentic commerce transactions and ramp and kind of milestones we should expect to see in its development. Thanks.
Ryan McInerney:
Thanks. We see considerable opportunity in agentic commerce. But just to put it in context, when we had the first wave of digital commerce with e-commerce, we set the standards, we led the product development, and Visa was a significant beneficiary. Then you saw a second wave of commerce, which was mobile commerce. And again, Visa was the leader in terms of standards, terms of product innovation, in terms of the capabilities enabling that to happen. And we've been a big beneficiary. You've seen that both in people buying things on their phones, but also using their phones to buy things, especially with tap to pay.
And now in this third wave of agentic commerce, we've been leading in terms of our role of setting the standards. I think one great example of that is Visa Intelligent Commerce, where we put out a set of capabilities for AI-ready cards leveraging tokenization, AI-powered personalization, leveraging our data token service. We put out a set of standards with payment instructions that are going to allow customers like you and I to easily set spending limits and conditions to provide clear guidance for agent transactions. And also our payment signals, which are going to share those data payloads in real time with Visa, enabling us to help set transaction controls, manage disputes and chargebacks, and those types of things.
So I think that's a great example of the leadership role that we're taking in agentic commerce. You know, and then just two weeks ago, we announced the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol. The Visa Trusted Agent Protocol is meant to really ensure that merchants know when an agent is coming to buy something on my behalf, it is actually a real agent that I have authorized to make purchases on my behalf. And I think what differentiates the Visa Trusted Agent Protocol is two things. One is it's open. It's an open set of standards, and we think that an open framework is critical to drive mass adoption in the way that's needed for agentic commerce.
And the second is it's easy to integrate. We've built it on existing web infrastructure so that it's going to be easy for merchants to integrate into existing messaging standards and get up and running quickly. So those would be two examples. We're very excited about it. We think it's a significant opportunity for Visa and for everyone involved in the ecosystem.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you, Jason Kupferberg. Your line is open from Wells Fargo.
Jason Kupferberg:
Hey. Thanks, guys. I actually wanted to ask a follow-up on agentic commerce. It seems to be the topic of the day. I'm just curious to get your perspective on when do you think we start seeing material volumes across the industry from agentic commerce. Obviously, there's still some important security considerations to be addressed. And we also love your perspective on to what extent you see agentic commerce as more of a substitute for traditional e-commerce versus being additive to the TAM of the overall payments industry? Thanks.
Ryan McInerney:
Hi, Jason. Let me address the second part of your question first and then the first part. On the second part of your question, because I think the base case is it continues to accelerate the adoption of e-commerce and mobile commerce as we all know it. I think there's an upside case on that where you could actually see users buying from a much larger and more diverse set of merchants than they do today in traditional e-commerce, given the power of these agents and their ability to go out and search the world's inventory based on whatever it is that you prefer for your agent.
That might be value, that might be price, that might be inventory, that might be speed of delivery, and so on and so forth. I think that could ultimately result in consumers buying more things from more merchants, which ultimately means more transactions on Visa. I also think there's a significant upside in the delivery and the relevance of our portfolio of value-added services for the entire ecosystem, especially as you said, they have to work through a number of things that involve potential fraud and disputes and chargebacks and things like that. If I go back to the first part of your question, listen, it's still early days.
And I think what you're likely to see in the evolution of agentic commerce is not different or dissimilar to what we saw in e-commerce. I think early on, you're seeing consumers use these agents and these platforms for discovery. They're shopping. They're looking for what might be available for any given gift I'm trying to buy or any clothing item that I might try to buy. But then I might jump to the actual merchant site to make the purchase. Then the next step of what you're starting to see is the integration of the buy capabilities into that shop journey. We're just starting to see that in the marketplace today.
We've been working on that for many, many months with the ecosystem. And then I think the ultimate kind of user experience and the promise of agentic commerce will be truly empowering agents to go out to search for things on our behalf and ultimately make purchases and buy things without human intervention. That we haven't really seen in the marketplace today, but we're working very hard with the platform players to ensure that the capabilities are in place to enable that. Thanks, Jason.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you. David Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.
David Koning:
Yeah. Hey, guys. Great job. The data process yield was up a lot, and I know that was explained somewhat, but I'm wondering is some of that due to VAS, the biggest part of VAS outside of others, probably in data processing? And I guess the question is, is there a sustainability to big yield growth in DP given VAS just keeps building? I guess that's the question.
Chris Suh:
Hi, David. I'll take this one. So, yes. As you pointed out, data processing revenue was 17% versus the 10% underlying transaction growth. The factors I called out in my prepared comments were around pricing and mix. And those were the two biggest variables. As you know, we implemented new pricing in 2025 in the second half of the year that's really benefiting in Q3 and Q4, and that will benefit into Q1 as I talked about as well. In terms of mix, now that you know, what does mix mean? Mix does know, across our business, different products and services, different clients in different regions can have different varying yields.
And obviously, you know, through the course of any quarter, we see different growth performance across any of those particular elements that'll drive different yield outcomes. So in this particular quarter, with data processing, we did see faster growth in higher-yielding cross-border regions, and that's what contributed to the acceleration that you saw in between transactions and revenue in data processing.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you. Darren Peller with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Darren Peller:
Hey. Thanks, guys. I just want to follow-up one more time on AI and then a bigger question on the new VisaNet rollout. So first, just to be clear on AI. I mean, you see your suite of services as a big part of what's being offered by, you know, other payments ecosystem partners. And how much are you going to participate in some of those vast in terms of fraud versus others? And then just I know we talked, Ryan, you talked about VisaNet rollout, the new rollout. And just help us understand what that can mean for product development or velocity and how it positions the network for things like agentic commerce or stablecoins going forward. Thanks, guys.
Ryan McInerney:
Hey, Darren. Short answer, long answer. Short answer is yes. And yes. But let me dive into both of those. On kind of agentic commerce, I think you've seen from us really over the course of the year is Visa doing what we do. Is when there's new technology, new platforms emerging, take a leadership role in establishing kind of the way that payments can work most efficiently and most effectively for buyers and sellers, and we're doing that in the agentic commerce space today.
And I think to the first part of your first question, yes, you should assume that we're doing the work to build the infrastructure, the operating regulations and rules, the processes to enable a lot of the things that you're seeing kind of in the marketplace today. As I said on the earlier question, I think it was Jason's, it's still very early days. You're going to see a lot of announcements. You're going to see a lot of things coming. What ultimately is going to help kind of agentic commerce achieve its promise is collaboration. Collaboration among all of these various ecosystem partners that make e-commerce and mobile commerce and all of these things work today.
And you should expect us to take the leadership role that we're taking. On the next generation of VisaNet, so this has been something we've been focused on as we continue to invest in our stack. We've deployed the next generation of VisaNet, which is our core processing platform at the base of our stack. And the answer to your second question is yes. As well. It allows us to ship product more quickly. It allows us to adapt to ecosystem changes more quickly. It allows us to adapt to regional and country-specific requirements more quickly. Here too, it's early days. We've just begun the deployment of it. But it's a very exciting milestone for us.
And ultimately, we think it'll be great for the ecosystem and our partners.

Thank you. Reyna Kumar with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.
Reyna Kumar:
Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I noticed in Latin America, there was a slight deceleration in volume versus last quarter. Anything to call out there? Thank you.
Chris Suh:
Sure. Yeah. In Latin America, we did see a bit of a slowdown. It still grew strong, but it was slower than we saw in Q3. And the biggest single contributor I would point to is the moderating inflation that we've seen in Argentina. But overall, across Latin America, it remains a high-growth region. And we're very pleased with the performance.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Thank you. Ken Chachowski with Anonymous Research. Your line is open.
Ken Chachowski:
Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one more on agentic commerce. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the differences and similarities between Visa's trusted agent protocol and Stripe's agentic commerce protocol? I mean, anything you could talk about in terms of what layer of the value chain you're tackling and how your offering is differentiated versus theirs? And then maybe just talk about the broader tokenization opportunity and your leadership there with over 16 billion tokens. And just how the agentic commerce ecosystem will leverage that? Thank you.
Ryan McInerney:
Yeah. Thanks, Ken. On the second part of your question, tokenization, I think, is the critical building block that ultimately will help agentic commerce reach its promise. And if you go back, I know you asked about the trusted agent protocol, but if you go back to the Visa Intelligent Commerce set of products and standards that we put out, tokenization as a platform is what enables the bulk of that functionality, and ultimately is what's going to enable us all to have safe, secure, trusted transactions with agents on our behalf. So tokenization is a critical building block of that.
And as you noted with kind of 16 billion Visa tokens embedded across the ecosystem, the technology, the standards are well known, well adopted globally in countries all around the world, both on the seller side of the ecosystem and the issuer side of the ecosystem. Which is ultimately why it'll help scale our standards. As it relates to the trusted agent protocol, and I'll go back a moment to what I said, is collaboration. To a couple of questions ago. Ultimately, what's going to make this all work.
And so I think you're seeing a lot of different players across the ecosystem, whether it's Visa, or other networks, or acquirers, or PSPs, or platforms, start to put out their capabilities and standards. And again, here too, I think it's where the Visa trusted agent protocol can form a base layer for everyone to build on and everyone to ultimately leverage. And what we're the reason we're excited about the trusted agent protocol scaling is the two things I mentioned. One is it's an open standard. And two, it is designed to be inherently lightweight and easy for merchants especially to integrate to.
Jennifer Como:
Next question.
Operator:
Brian King with Citi. Please go ahead.
Brian King:
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two kind of two quick parter. Just thinking about holiday sales growth rate this year versus last, there's some expectation that maybe holiday sales will be a little bit weaker in terms of growth rate. Just how is Visa thinking about that? And then secondly, just cross-border growth versus e-commerce versus travel, any differentiation kind of what we've seen on trend line as we go through this fiscal year? Thank you.
Chris Suh:
Okay. I'll take both of those. In terms of the upcoming holiday quarter, I've provided our guidance for Q1. It is for a strong Q1 carrying the momentum that we saw coming out of Q4 with strong and stable underlying drivers, as well as benefiting from the pricing from a year ago. And so when you add that all up, you know, it makes for a resilient consumer, a stable macro environment, and the resilience that, you know, I talked about across spend bands as well. So we are anticipating a strong quarter going into the holiday, our fiscal Q1, the holiday quarter that we see. In terms of cross-border, your second question was really around sort of the mix.
At the total level, we shared our numbers. It's been stable. It's a good strong number, 11% growth in Q3, 11% growth again in Q4. As we click down into the categories of e-commerce and travel, e-commerce has been strong, continued to be strong and steady, 13% in Q3 and 13% in Q4. Travel did improve a point from Q3, as we talked about previously as well. So the thing that I would call out though is that, you know, when you add that all up, total cross-border growth continues to be above the trend that we saw pre-COVID. And part of the reason for that is that the e-commerce part of the mix of the volume is bigger.
It was about a third of the business pre-COVID. It's about 40% now and continues to grow at a faster clip than travel. And so should that trend continue, we'll continue to see a bigger weight toward the e-commerce side of the business. But all in all, again, you zoom out strong and stable cross-border trends, and we'll continue to see how they perform through the rest of the year.

Hi. Good afternoon. I want to ask about stablecoins. As the dust is settling a bit post the passage of the Genius Act, it increasingly appears that what was initially thought as a risk to be record in fact an opportunity, in cross-border money movement, merchant acceptance in certain markets, and services. Ryan, you talked about the momentum in stablecoin-linked cards. You know, this quarter Visa Direct announced a new stablecoin prefunding option. The number of things you're doing here. I guess my question is, what are the most tangible areas of opportunity that as it relates to stablecoins in the coming years, maybe in cards, BaaS, new clothes, etcetera? Thank you.
Ryan McInerney:
Harshita, we've seen it as an opportunity for a while now. And the short answer to your question is we see opportunities in issuance, in modernizing our settlement network. I think I talked about some of the opportunities we've captured with our PISMO platform. As you said, we're leveraging stablecoins in cross-border money movement. We announced the Visa Direct prefunding work. We're minting and burning on behalf of our clients with the Visa tokenized asset platform. We've been working with our clients in our consulting business with stablecoins. I mean, the list goes on and on.
But just stepping back, as I've said, the areas where there's product market fit for stablecoins in the world are the areas where there's significant TAMs, and largely where we're underpenetrated. And that's emerging markets, and that's cross-border money movement. And we have a deep product pipeline focused on putting products to market against both of those areas of opportunity. And by the way, cross-border money movement broadly. Whether that's remittances or B2B or gig economy payouts or the like. So we definitely see it as an opportunity. We have targeted a significant portion of our product roadmap to capture that opportunity and hope to talk to you more about some products we will bring into market in the future.
Jennifer Como:
We're gonna take a few more questions, so we are gonna go a little over. Just wanna try to get in a few more. Next question, please.
Operator:
Andrew Schmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Schmidt:
Hi, Ryan. Hey, Chris. Thanks for taking the question and appreciate the Visa stack discussion. That was a good one. Maybe I could ask about the Asia Pac improvement. Chris, I know you mentioned timing in China improvement, but if we could peel back the layers there and maybe talk a little bit more about what's going on and whether that improvement is sustainable? That would be great. Thanks so much.
Chris Suh:
Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. As I talked about in my prepared comments, we did we were pleased to see the improved results, 2.5 points. And the things that I noted, improvement in Mainland China, and some smaller but idiosyncratic sorts of things around timing. Those will normalize its way out. All in all, we're pleased with the momentum in China. And in, across AP in general and think that is gonna continue to be an important growth opportunity for us. And so, you know, when we zoom out from all of that, I think AP is on a directionally good track.
Jennifer Como:
Next question, please.
Operator:
Tim Chiodo with UBS. Please go ahead.
Tim Chiodo:
Great. Thank you. I wanna talk a little bit about the evolution of the growth algorithm. Just looking at it numerically, it looks like the biggest change really is a few years ago, not too long ago, value-added services was about 20% of revenue growing in the high teens. And now it's approaching 30% of revenue and growing in the mid-twenties. So the growth contribution has stepped up at least 200 basis points, if not closer to 300 basis points. And part of that has been we've seen the RPO tick up over the years. And even this year, the RPO has been up roughly, give or take, 30%.
And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about that RPO, what's been driving that roughly 30% growth. I appreciate part of that is valuing time incentives. Maybe dig into that and other drivers of the RPO.
Ryan McInerney:
Yes. Why don't I take the first part of the question and then Chris, you can take the second part of the question. Tim, I think you summarized it very well. And I think if you go back to Investor Day and you look at kind of the growth framework that we laid out and the strategies that we laid out, by the way, both for VAS and for CMS, and you jump forward to today, we're delivering in market those strategies and we're delivering the results that I think we laid out in that framework that come with those strategies. And you summarized it pretty well on the VAS side of things.
Chris, do you want to talk about the RPO?
Chris Suh:
Sure. Sure. Tim, I think you know this. Obviously, the RPO constitutes many things. But included in that is what you've asked about previously, which is value in kind. This is an important lever for us. It represents a form of incentive that the clients can then use to drive value for themselves, and it's good for our client engagement and continues to drive value to Visa. Sometimes in value-added services, but in other parts of the business. Now it doesn't drive sort of the majority of value-added services. It is an important lever. And I think it's an area where we'll continue to see clients really take advantage of.
Jennifer Como:
Alright. I think we're ready for our last question.
Operator:
Thank you. Tien Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tien Tsin Huang:
Alright. Let's close it out. I'll ask about investments and OpEx, if that's okay. Just thinking about growth and OpEx being in line with revenue. I'm curious if there's anything to share on that. Is Visa just being opportunistic with spending? Or perhaps it's a structural issue as you scale different layers in your service stack? And of those are less mature. Just trying to better understand incremental margins and how that might be changing. Thanks.
Chris Suh:
Sure. Tien Tsin, as you know, as we've said in the past, explicitly, we don't manage our company to a margin target, at least not in the classical sense. But we do focus on many things. We focus on growing volumes with our clients, we focus on driving revenue across consumer payments, VAS, and CMS, and we also focus on running our business as efficiently and as effectively as we can. And part of that is balancing the investments that we make for short, medium, and long-term return. And when we do this well, as we have, we continue to deliver the financial performance that you've seen, which is strong growth at margins that lead the industry.
So I would say, you know, in terms of where we're investing now, as we talk about 2026, I would point you back to actually our investor day back in February. We laid out a pretty extensive view of the big opportunity that we're going after, the massive addressable opportunity, and two, the clear strategies, the things that we're going to go do to go capture that opportunity. And so across our industry, continue to move as fast as they are, heard a lot of the conversation even today around agentic and stablecoin. We think it's important that we continue to invest in these opportunities from our position.
And if we do so, we'll continue to deliver on the growth framework that we outlined at Investor Day, which means we'll deliver compelling profit growth and drive strong shareholder returns.
Ryan McInerney:
And hey, Tien Tsin, the only thing I would add on what Chris said is, I don't ever recall being so excited about the opportunities ahead of this company. And I don't ever recall being so pleased with how well our teams have lined up our product pipeline, go-to-market sales motions, our client teams, the things that we talked about today, whether it's agentic, stablecoins, Visa Pay, Visa accept, tap to everything, you know, the great momentum in the VAS business, the great momentum in Visa Direct, the great momentum and results we're seeing in Visa commercial.
It's just an extraordinarily exciting time for the company, and I'm just, you know, super proud of the investments that everybody's making across the place. So appreciate that question. Appreciate everybody's questions. Jennifer, back to you to close.
Jennifer Como:
Yeah. And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call or email our investor relations team. Again, and have a great day.
Operator:
Thank you all for participating in Visa fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2025 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. You may disconnect at this time and please enjoy the rest of your day."

Risks
Chief Financial Officer Mehra stated, ""As you would expect, the debit migration which takes place, we will lose the associated revenue on this. As previously mentioned on an earlier earnings call, we do not expect the net revenue impact from the Capital One debit migration to be material in 2025 (non-GAAP). Just a little bit of kind of context as we go into 2026. Cards start to migrate away from us and are migrating away from us. That being said, there are some contractual obligations, some of this financial impact in 2026. Net-net there'll still be an adverse impact from a net revenue standpoint, but I just wanted to make sure you guys had some context as we go into 2026 as to what that looks like.""
Chief Financial Officer Mehra said, ""U.S. switched volumes saw a sequential decline primarily due to the expected Capital One debit migration as well as some tougher comps related to weather impacts in 2024.""
Chief Financial Officer Mehra said, ""The tax rate in the quarter was higher than expected due to a discrete tax expense.""

Full Conference Call Transcript
Devin Corr:
Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2025 earnings call. With me today are Michael Miebach, our Chief Executive Officer, and Sachin Mehra, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. It is only then that the queue will open for questions. You can access our earnings release, supplemental performance data, and the slide deck that accompany this call in the Investor Relations section of our website, Mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was furnished with the SEC earlier this morning.
Our comments today regarding our financial results will be on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. Finally, as set forth in more detail in our earnings release, I would like to remind everyone that today's call will include forward-looking statements regarding Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our earnings release and in our recent SEC filings. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for thirty days.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Miebach.
Michael Miebach:
Thanks, Devin. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 15% overall, and value-added services and solutions net revenue was up 22% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. Our solid performance is a reflection of our winning strategy, our market-leading innovation, and focused execution. We continue to see healthy consumer and business spending in the quarter, with the macroeconomic environment still generally supportive. Inflation levels have remained fairly steady, and labor markets remain well balanced. Financial markets were near record highs, further contributing to the wealth effect, which helps stimulate spend. Given this backdrop and our diversified business, we are positioned well for ongoing success.
And looking at the quarter, our drumbeat of wins continued. Our partnership approach, combined with our differentiated payments propositions and value-added services and solutions, continues to drive wins. This quarter, we have multiple co-brand wins with large airlines and retailers, including Japan Airlines, Vakomir in Mexico, and Uni-President Group in Taiwan. We have also expanded our relationships with bank partners globally, a testament to the unique value we bring. In the Nordics, we have renewed our strategic partnership with Nordea on card issuance and service capabilities. And we're happy to announce that Mastercard will be the new bank exclusive network partner in the U.S. as that card program launches. This builds upon our extensive partnership across the Americas.
Earlier this year, we unveiled the Mastercard World Legend card, designed specifically for the ultra-high-net-worth individual. We also launched the Mastercard Collection, a set of globally connected premium benefits and experiences for our World, World Elite, and World Legend cardholders. This combined differentiated value proposition helped us win several key affluent portfolios around the world, including First Abu Dhabi Bank in the UAE, Saudi Awad Bank, and Saudi National Bank. Doha Bank in Qatar, in Brazil, we are partnering with several banks, including Itau, Banco do Brasil, C6 banks, and PTAG on new affluent portfolios, reinforcing our strong credit position in that key market.
Moving on from our recent wins, we are focused on executing against our three strategic priorities to unlock long-term growth. I'll touch on each, starting with consumer payments. The consumer secular opportunity is tremendous, with $11 trillion in GDV and $1.5 trillion transactions still happening in cash and check around the globe. And even further opportunity with China and account-to-account bill payments. We are targeting these flows by expanding our acceptance footprint across underpenetrated verticals and by opening closed-loop payment networks. Let's look at the rent vertical. The volume of rental payments globally is substantial. Today, most of the payments are paid through check or ACH and are recurring in nature, so naturally a focus for us.
Through our co-brand and services capabilities, we have successfully unlocked acceptance and scale with partners. This quarter, we partnered with Renti, a rental management platform in New Zealand. This relationship both unlocks card acceptance and includes rich rewards for their customers who choose Mastercard. A powerful example of how we are delivering value across this ecosystem. Moving on to closed-loop payment networks. This quarter, we deployed new contactless acceptance across closed-loop transit systems in Italy, Japan, Chile, and with the Chengdu and Guangzhou metro systems in China. Altogether, we have digitized hundreds of systems across major cities around the globe. The simple tap-and-go experience is a great way to shift consumer behavior, and we are seeing strong results.
It also can be a transaction multiplier. Rather than buying one monthly MetroCard, we see a transaction for each ride. Volumes are up too. Through the third quarter of this year, Mastercard GDV on open-loop transit systems increased 25% year over year on a local currency basis. Not to mention the halo effect this can drive in everyday spend categories. And that is powerful. We're also driving incremental volumes from local stored value digital wallets over the Mastercard network. Through our partnership with Alipay Plus, a network of 36 e-wallets, we're now expanding cross-border payment enablement to Kakao Pay in South Korea, following earlier launches with Alipay HK and GCash.
And in India, we're working with PhonePe to enable their consumers to transact in person and online using their Mastercard payment credentials. Digital wallets are increasingly partnering with Mastercard because of the value they see in our unmatched global acceptance across hundreds of millions of merchant locations and digital access points. Genetic Commerce is here. And we're at the center of it. With our global acceptance reach, trusted brand, and services capabilities, we're instrumental in creating the foundations for Genetic Commerce. Now working with key players such as OpenAI on their AgenTek Commerce protocol, and with Google, and Cloudflare to set industry standards, all to drive safety and security.
Through Mastercard Agent Pay, we're enabling agents to facilitate transactions over Mastercard's payment network in a secure and scalable way. We already have agents registered and have tools in place for easy onboarding, others are ready. Our first AgenTeq transaction took place on our network this quarter, a pivotal moment in payments. And that's just the start. U.S. Bank and Citibank cardholders can now use AgentPay. The rest of our U.S. issuers will be enabled in November, with a global rollout to follow early next year. And the beauty of it all, we've made it easy for merchants across the globe to benefit on day one, with the same trust and security they are used to from us today.
Our acceptance framework enables any Mastercard merchant to participate without significant development or integration, a no-code approach. For Jentic Payments, we bring trust and transparency and have the right capabilities and acceptance reach. We have strong partnerships with the players I just mentioned and many more, including Walmart, to accelerate the adoption of AgenTek commerce using cards through Mastercard Agent Pay. And our services play a big role, both today, but even more so as we look to the future. Players across the payments ecosystem are partnering with Mastercard and our dedicated consulting teams to ready themselves for AgenTik commerce. Agents through Mastercard's inside tokens can make AgenTik Commerce even more personalized.
By harnessing our proprietary data, we will be able to provide agents with predictive insights to help drive smarter decisions and recommendations. The shift we're seeing in commerce is creating further opportunity for our capabilities. More consulting, more loyalty, more security, and so on. The runway for AgenTx focuses services in consumer and business use cases is long, and we're well-positioned to capture this opportunity. Like AgenticCommerce, we believe stablecoins are an attractive and growing opportunity for our network. We believe in offering consumers and merchants the choice in how they transact. For years, our network has therefore enabled crypto and stablecoin to be purchased and spent across our acceptance footprint.
We have approximately 130 crypto co-brand card programs in the market with associated volumes and transactions growing at a healthy clip. We're expanding our partnerships through new deals with consensus on the MetaMask card in the U.S. and with finance in Brazil. We also continue to see strong growth in the on-ramp as well, quarter three year-to-date transactions up over 25% with spend at crypto merchants. Moving on to commercial and new payment flows. The B2B opportunity is massive, and we are deploying a targeted strategy to capture it. Small business remains a top priority. Over the last year, we have increased small business Mastercard in the market by more than 10%.
Key to our growth has been working with our traditional issuing partners, such as Carrefour Financial Services in Spain. But also through alternative distributors. This quarter, we partnered with Zaggle, a spend management provider in India. This too credit a small business financing platform in the U.S. and RTS, a transportation services provider in the U.S. to distribute commercial and small business cards to their customer bases. Similarly, we are working with Instacart in the U.S. to issue small business cards offering rich rewards and instant payouts using Mastercard Move capabilities. Our virtual cards drive benefits across the ecosystem. Suppliers get paid faster with certainty and streamlined reconciliation, Buyers improve working capital and gain more control over spend.
All in a simple and secure way. AWVR will now be issuing Mastercard virtual cards to their travel agency customers in Mexico, and there are plans to expand the solution beyond to South America and Europe. We're making it easier for corporates to use virtual card capabilities within their existing workflows. Now with more than 10 global B2B and T and E platforms on board, several regional partnerships also in place. Working alongside issuers, acquirers, and payment facilitators to embed card payment tools and unlock acceptance within the platforms that buyers and suppliers already use every day. And we continue to deliver value to the supplier through simplified reconciliation tools and flexible B2B economics.
We have offered flexible rates in the travel space and in the U.S. for domestic business-to-business flows for years. Looking at the U.S. program, we have nearly doubled the number of customers participating over the last two years. Given its success, we are scaling flexible rate programs across the globe. Next, Mastercard Move. Our disbursement and remittances capabilities remain strong with over 35% transaction growth this past quarter. To further scale adoption, we are integrating Mastercard Move into leading core banking platforms, including Infosys this quarter. Penetrating key markets in EMEA through our partnerships with Worldpay and STC Bank. And in China, we've enabled more ways for consumers to make outbound remittances across our billions of endpoints.
In June, we announced how we have embedded stablecoins into Mastercard Move capabilities to support disbursements, remittances, and B2B use cases. This spans pre-funding with Stablecoins to sending Stablecoins across the globe, which can be received in any local fiat currency or supported stablecoin. We continue to execute against this roadmap now with prefunding capabilities in place with customers in Europe, Middle East Africa, including Paysend this quarter. Moving on to our third strategic pillar, Service. We have curated an expansive services portfolio featuring security, consumer engagement, and business and market insights. Our services differentiate our payment network and drive meaningful value for our customers beyond the transaction itself.
We're actively driving growth by further penetrating our existing customers, diversifying into new customer types, and through new innovations. Let's look at each of these. We have extended our reach and share of wallet across our bank customers. We now have strategic relationships with the retail bank as well as marketing, loyalty, and security officers across several of our customers. A great example is how we're building on a successful partnership with the Broadhurst Bank in Canada. We expanded our collaboration with their parent company Rogers Communications to provide fraud prevention security offerings and payment gateway solutions. They are also an initial partner to use our newly announced Mastercard Merchant Cloud offering, which I will touch on later.
And we're expanding our customer base across merchants, governments, and digital players. A few key examples from this quarter include the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs, who will use recorded futures threat intelligence capability. Equifax in Australia will be using our Open Finance capabilities to help inform their customers' lending practices to underserved consumers. Beyond that, we are continuously innovating to further penetrate and grow the €165 billion serviceable market we outlined at last year's Investor Day. We continue to innovate within payments. Last month, we launched On Demand Decisioning, a fully customized rules engine that gives issuers greater flexibility and control of payment authorizations.
This is a great example of how our network can help issuers optimize payment portfolios and strengthen their user experience in a fast, efficient way. For the merchant community, we launched the merchant cloud offering, Mastercard's acceptance gateway tokenization fraud and insight solutions through a unified platform. Partners can now simply integrate these services into their propositions or resell directly to their customers. This is a great example of how we are delivering our innovations at scale. We're also extending our value beyond the by leveraging insights from our rich and extensive data sets. By combining Mastercard's payment expertise and global network visibility with recorded Futures leading fiber threat intelligence capabilities, we were excited to recently announce Mastercard Threat Intelligence.
Issuers and acquirers using Mastercard Threat Intelligence can proactively detect cyber attacks in order to prevent payment fraud. Mastercard Threat Intelligence complements our existing cybersecurity intelligence, fraud scoring, and defense functionalities. And to conclude, we recently launched Mastercard Commerce Media, a new digital media network that makes advertising more personalized, relevant, and effective. Advertisers are under pressure to prove that every dollar spent drives real outcomes. Mastercard Commerce Media uniquely helps advertisers to have tailored offers to the right consumer at the right time by using our proprietary SpendIn site. Once the offer has been served, able to measure the effectiveness of each ad by linking it directly to a purchase.
Devin Corr:
Ad purchase made.
Michael Miebach:
Building off our existing loyalty programs and technology, we're able to connect the 500 million enrolled and permissioned consumers and 25,000 merchant advisors advertisers on day one. As you can see, we're relentlessly focused on delivering value to our customers, and that's why customers continue to choose Mastercard. So with that, I'll wrap it up. We delivered another strong quarter, a significant opportunity ahead. Fundamentals of our business are strong. I am very optimistic about the future of Mastercard. Our proven growth algorithm, differentiated solutions, and continuous innovation positions us to deliver and win as we've demonstrated time and time again. It's an exciting time in payments, and Mastercard is at the forefront. Sachin, over to you.
Sachin Mehra:
Thanks, Michael. Let's turn to Page three, which shows our financial performance for the third quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 15% from reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Acquisitions contributed one ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 14%, including a full ppt increase from acquisitions. And operating income was up 15%, which includes a one ppt headwind from acquisitions.
Net income and EPS increased 811% respectively, driven primarily by the strong operating income growth partially offset by a higher effective tax rate due to Pillar two and a change in our geographic mix of earnings. The tax rate in the quarter was higher than expected due to a discrete tax expense. EPS was $4.38, which includes a $0.00 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $3.3 billion worth of stock and an additional $1.2 billion through October 27, 2025. Now turning to Page four, let's first look at some of our key volume drivers for the third quarter on a local currency basis. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 9% year over year.
The U.S, GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 7% and debit growth of 7%. Outside of the U.S, volume increased 10% with credit growth of 10% and debit growth of 9%. Overall, cross-border volume increased 15% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued growth in both travel and non-travel-related cross-border spending. Turning to Page five, switch transactions grew 10% year over year in Q3. We continue to see an increase in contactless penetration, which in Q3 stood at 77% of all in-person switch purchase transactions. This is up six ppt since the same period last year. In addition, card growth was 6%. Globally, there are 3.6 billion Mastercard and Maestro branded cards issued.
Turning to Slide six for a look into our net revenue growth rates for the third quarter. Discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment Network net revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth. It also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 22%. Acquisitions contributed approximately three ppt to this growth. The remaining 19% increase was primarily driven by growth in our underlying drivers, strong demand across security, digital and authentication solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights. And pricing. Now let's turn to page seven to discuss key metrics related to the payment network.
Again, all growth rates are described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each key metric. Domestic assessments were up 6% while worldwide GDV grew 9%. The three ppt difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 16% while cross-border volumes increased 15%. The one ppt difference is driven by pricing in international markets partially offset by mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 15% while switched transactions grew 10%. An unrounded basis, the four ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as well as some benefit from pricing and revenue from FX volatility. Other network assessments were $255 million this quarter.
Moving on to Page eight, you can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 14%, which includes a full ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the growth of total adjusted operating expenses was primarily driven by increased spending to support various strategic initiatives, including investing in our infrastructure, geographic expansion, enhancing and delivering our products and services, and advertising and marketing. Total adjusted operating expenses were lower than expected this quarter primarily due to the timing of expenses between the third and fourth quarter. Turning to Page nine, let me comment on the operating metric trend. Starting with Q3, all our switch metrics are generally in line with Q2 and remain strong.
As we look to the first four weeks of October, our metrics continue to remain strong, generally in line with the third quarter. Of note, U.S. switched volumes saw a sequential decline primarily due to the expected Capital One debit migration as well as some tougher comps related to weather impacts in 2024. Overall, continue to see healthy consumer and business spending. Turning to Page 10, I wanted to share our thoughts for the remainder of the year. The headline is that our business remains strong and consumer and business spending remains healthy. We delivered another strong quarter.
The macroeconomic environment is supportive with balanced unemployment rates, wage growth continuing to outpace the rate of inflation for the most part, and the wealth effect remaining intact. That said, there continues to be some ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty. We remain well-positioned for the opportunities ahead, driven by our resilient and diversified business model, the significant opportunity for further secular shift to digital forms of payment, and strong demand for our value-added services and solutions. We remain laser-focused on executing against our strategy and remaining at the forefront of payments and services as demonstrated by the innovative new solutions that Michael just highlighted. And we do all of this while also maintaining a disciplined capital planning approach.
Now turning to our expectations for the fourth quarter. We assume continued healthy consumer and business spending. We expect year-over-year net revenue growth to be at the high end of a low double digits range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. As mentioned last quarter, our rebates and incentives as a percentage of our payment network assessments is expected to be higher in the second half of 2025. We continue to see Q4 having the highest contra percentage relative to the other quarters, primarily driven by timing within the year and normal seasonality.
For the quarter, acquisitions are forecasted to add 1% to 1.5 ppt to the net revenue growth rate, and we expect a tailwind of four to 4.5 ppt from foreign exchange for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q4 growth to be at the low double digits range versus a year ago, again on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to add four ppt to five ppt to this OpEx growth, while we expect an approximately two ppt headwind from foreign exchange for the quarter. Now turning to the full year 2025. We continue to expect net revenues to grow at the low teens range on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions.
Acquisitions are expected to add one to 1.5 ppt to this growth rate for the year, and we estimate a tailwind of one to two ppt from foreign exchange. From an operating expense standpoint, we continue to expect growth to be at the low end of a low double digits range versus a year ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecasted to increase the OpEx growth rate for the year by four to five ppt, while we expect a headwind of zero to one ppt from foreign exchange. Other items to keep in mind, on other income and expenses in Q4, we expect an expense of approximately $110 million.
This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metric. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be around 21% for Q4 and between 20.5% and 21% for the full year. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin.
Devin Corr:
Thank you, Sachin. Thank you, Michael. Julianne, you may now open up the call for questions.
Operator:
Thank you. Press star, then number 1 on your telephone keypad. Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Bryan Bergin:
Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you. Wanted to ask on U.S. payment volume growth. So steady overall activity is evident here. But just curious on the surface, you're just seeing any evidence of trade down or differing consumer cohort behavior? And then just any early views on potential holiday spend? Sure, Bryan. I'll take that question. Look, I mean, drivers continue to hold up really well. You can see that in our metrics. True in the third quarter continues to be the case in the first four weeks of October.
As it relates to different segments of the population, when we do our analysis based on looks at the various products we have out in the market, which serve the affluent population versus the mass market population, as well as when we look at the amount of spend which is taking place across different categories of products that we have, what we're seeing is continued steady growth both across affluent and mass market. True in the U.S., true across the globe. So overall, consumer continues to spend, and really everything we're seeing so far is manifesting itself in the drivers which we're talking about right here.
Michael Miebach:
And you can expect that consumers at different income levels make different decisions on their spend, you know, discretionary versus nondiscretionary. What matters for us is it has to be carded, and that plays in, and that adds up to the resilient trends that Sachin just talked about.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Darrin Peller:
Right. Hey, thanks, guys. Nice results. When I look at VAS at 22% growth, I think it was a few points from recorded future also, though. Just remind us exactly. But just maybe revisit the underlying drivers that you're seeing really, really that kind of sustainability. And if those are going to be sustainable throughout the year ahead of us, then next twelve to eighteen months, what are they and what's driving it? How much of that could be tokenization that's driving into agentic also going forward? And then just a quick follow-up also on the Capital One Discover side. I know you mentioned you included it in the guide, that was the debit side.
Is there anything on credit you're seeing or just a little more color on that would be great.
Michael Miebach:
Alright. So, Darrin, let me start on the VAS side. We took great care in curating the VAS portfolio over the better part of the last decade. And we were very keen to find a portfolio mix that is anchored in underlying trends. So digitization, more data, more data, more need for security, more data, more need for insights to run a business in a better way. You've heard us say that a thousand times, and it continues to be very true. When I look at the demand on cybersecurity with the rising fraud landscape and more fraud vectors out there, that just continues to power on. And we step right into that with a series of innovations.
I mentioned Mastercard Threat Intelligence earlier in my prepared remarks. To your question about recorded future, Sachin can talk about the points there. But that is our data coming together with recorded futures. Right? And intelligence that comes from a powerful combination. And there's a lot of companies out there that provide security solutions. But you cannot really outspend all the threats. So what threat intelligence does is it allows you to be very, very targeted in your spending on cybersecurity. And that is really a very powerful proposition for our customers.
Just to have one example, when I think about the whole piece about how we help our customers run their business in a better way, drive their top line, consumer engagement, personalization, data, and business market insights matter more than ever before. And for us, we have the whole set of solutions. Earlier when I was talking about our loyalty components, that is a business that today also matters even more. So I feel we are sitting on the right trends. I don't see any discontinuity in terms of the demand breaking down for that. I mean, the tall order for us is we need to continue to innovate.
I just I think I mentioned like six new innovations around that. And that is what we just have to keep powering on. So the innovation muscle of the company is alive and well, and we keep training it.
Sachin Mehra:
Yes. And Darrin, I'll just add to what Michael just talked about on VAS, but I'll speak to your Capital One question first. Your specific question around we had growth in VAS this 22%, three points of that was driven by the acquisitions in Recorded Future and Mina. So you had underlying organic growth of approximately 19%. So that's kind of one part of the question you asked. The second thing I'll just remind, the key drivers of growth on VAS come across the board, right? At Investor Day, we had shared with you that roughly 60% of our VAS revenues are network-linked.
So underlying growth in drivers and underlying growth and tapping into that secular shift, which we got from a driver standpoint, contributes to VAS growth, point number one. Point number two, back to what Michael said, with the steady drumbeat of new products which are being launched in the market as well as further penetration of existing products across security solutions, across consumer acquisition engagement, across our business and market insights, these are all contributing factors to the overall growth rate. And then the last piece is pricing, right? And pricing is based on the value we deliver. So as we launch new products in the market, we can deliver and price for that. And so that's what we do.
That's all adding to the overall kind of algorithm which drives the services growth. I will say that and this as well that services growth is something we look at as a long-term opportunity. And we look at it certainly, you know, not only for this year but for years to come. This is an important part of how we are driving the growth of our overall business. On your question on Capital One, look, I mean, the debit migration is underway. No surprise there. A few things to kind of just point out there. As you would expect, the debit migration which takes place, we will lose the associated revenue on this.
I had mentioned previously in a prior earnings call that in 2025, we did not expect the net revenue impact from this Capital One debit migration to be material. Just a little bit of kind of context as we go into 2026. Cards start to migrate away from us and are migrating away from us. That being said, there are some contractual obligations, some of this financial impact in 2026. Net-net there'll still be an adverse impact from a net revenue standpoint, but I just wanted to make sure you guys had some context as we go into 2026 as to what that looks like.
Specifically on credit, we continue to have a very robust partnership with Capital One on credit. And we don't see that changing as our partnership continues to grow and things are going well there as well.
Michael Miebach:
I think there was one other aspect in your rather long question, Darrin, and that was about tokenization. So I just want to not answer that. So on the tokenization front, we're in the billions per month, and that has totally scaled. We started to build out a set of services around tokenization, and we started to price for that because that comes back to such points of value that we provide, and it's in great demand. So we see that's a massive differentiator for us as many of our other services versus local payment networks and local alternatives. And hence, the demand keeps going.
Darrin Peller:
Thanks, guys.
Operator:
Our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.
James Faucette:
Thank you very much. Wanted to ask about the evolution and enablement that Mastercard is providing for agentic commerce. Can you talk a little bit about how not only Mastercard is helping accelerate that, it seems like, but any of the unique threat or risk and even legal issues that you're need to be considered and how we should think about tracking the growth in agentic commerce and its contribution? Thanks.
Michael Miebach:
Right. So let me start with that. So this is a significant development. I think there's two lenses to look at it. The first is, you know, we're seeing is behavioral change driven powered by generative AI and bots and so forth where search behavior is changing. So that's on the consumer side, if we start right there. So consumers are migrating their search increasingly so to their favorite chatbot and asking their queries there. And they get potentially better answers. Who knows? But that behavior shift is changing. But it still feels like you're searching for something and then you're going to some sort of a checkout.
The other lens on this is it's a really quite a significant paradigm shift for the payment ecosystem. Because in the payment ecosystem, what happens is there's now an extra party that has entered the realm. And that is the agent. So that comes with a lot of those aspects you just talked about in your question. There's legal questions. There's a security question. So if I break it down and some of the things that need to happen in a world of agentic commerce is, the first is, is this a real bot? Is this a bot that we believe matches up to Mastercard's safety and security standards? So we will certify and register bots out there.
So that's what Mastercard Agent Pay does. That's what we do. That's what we do today with participants in the ecosystem. So nothing really new from us on a perspective, but it's a new party. Not really visible to the consumer in that way, but certainly driving some complexity potentially for merchants, for every other party because that is just a new flow for the transaction. The next thing to think about is how will merchants deal with all of this. Earlier, I used the word no-code approach. So, you know, we have learned this during the day of the various wallets that were out there. It is not easy for merchants to consume this.
So what we have done here is we created a merchant framework that allows us to integrate and engage with merchants and with other parties that bring out protocols like Stripe and OpenAI and so forth to make this very easy for merchants. So that is important. The merchant needs to know that the agent on the other side that we have certified is actually the agent. So we have to pass through that information and ensure that the circle closes. We're doing that. While there's still the question of what is in focus today very much so is the consumer the person they claim to be?
So consumer authentication needs to continue, but it now needs to flow through a somewhat more complicated transaction. So all of this is happening. Now the tricky part is, if you have asked an agent to buy you something in a chat and then in the end you challenge that transaction, who can prove who's right? Is it the consumer? Is it the merchant? What happens? What do you do on return policies and various other things? Those are all complexities that we're pretty good at solving in today's world and that we're pretty busy solving in the future world, and that comes down to some of the aspects that you've talked about in your question.
Where is the legal and regulatory framework on this yet? This is not something that's specifically contemplated, but that will evolve over time. And basically, it takes parties like us who focus on safety and security and not trust. Because only when there's trust, this whole space will actually evolve. Our set of services around this will assist in this effort that I have just described. I think it's also important to note that this is an opportunity for us to drive our business forward. Because if we do this work better than anybody else, that's a tremendous opportunity for us.
And some of the things that I see that we have built in our portfolio here to power AgenticCommerce is, for example, on the point of challenging a transaction, we've bought a company a couple of years ago called Ethoca, and what they do is they provide transaction detail at the moment of a chargeback to a consumer that says, hey, you actually did the transaction because you were here at this time doing the following. And the same can be done with this audit trail that would be capturing out of the chat that I talked about earlier. That is one example.
There are identity solutions, there are merchant services, there is advisor, etcetera, the whole host of services will help us make this a safe and secure ecosystem and, you know, live up to the opportunity that we all think it could be. And everything I just said does not stop at consumer. You can transport the same logic into the B2B context for other use cases that will emerge over time.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Wells Fargo.
Jason Kupferberg:
Morning, guys. Thanks. I wanted to come back to the topic of opening new acceptance channels. On the consumer side, you mentioned rent. I feel like that's been targeted for a while, hasn't really taken off. I'm wondering what you see as some of the catalysts to unlock those volumes or the interchange models. Changing at all and just any other newer acceptance verticals you see as emerging would be interesting to hear about. And then Sachin, you can just give us a quick word on M&A pipeline. I think it's been almost a year that recorded future, that would be great. Thank you.
Michael Miebach:
Right. So, you know, going into underpenetrated verticals where there's ingrained behavior for many years, it takes a little bit of time. But I feel we're starting to make some real progress here. Gave you an example from another part of the world, New Zealand, but here with built we've made a lot of progress here in the United States. A lot if you ask around in your circles and young kids who pay their rent, they're dying to pay on build. There's our rewards programs, all that behind is an important differentiator. So I really feel there is momentum there. We are very specific not to pick a whole host of different verticals. Because they all have their intricacies.
So we focus on healthcare as well. We focus on tourism and we gave plenty of updates over the last over the last couple of calls on that. So it is trying to use our existing set of solutions but then find a nuance that makes a difference and find those partners like Build and Rentie in this. So I do say I do think we are making progress. It's a tremendous that we laid out from a target market perspective, and we're chipping away at it.
Sachin Mehra:
And, Jason, on your question on M&A, look, I mean, just stepping back, our philosophy around M&A remains pretty much unchanged. Always been strategy-led, and it will continue to be strategy-led, right? And so when we have something from a strategy standpoint, which we need to accomplish, we kind of think step back and think about, do we want to build, buy or partner? And to the extent we think it's appropriate to actually that's where M&A comes in. The pipeline is robust. We are very, very deliberate about how we go about, you know, filtering through and funneling through on that pipeline.
To make sure it's on point and it's going to deliver the synergistic value that we expect to deliver. As part of that. So look, I would say the focus areas will remain very similar to what they have in the past in terms of how we have gone about executing on M&A. It's been primarily focused on And then on occasion, there's areas around the payment network side that we need to do stuff, we'll certainly look at that as well.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Bryan Keane:
Yes, guys. Hi, good morning. I have two just kind of follow-ups. On AgenTek Commerce, Michael, maybe you can help us understand how Mastercard maybe can take share in AgenTek Commerce given your position and versus competition, what can maybe differentiate you? And who would you be taking share from? And then just a clarification for Sachin on the Cap One migration, the debit migration, how much comes off in 2025 versus 2026? And then I guess with the contractual obligations, then it's a very small headwind in '26 and maybe a little bit of a headwind in '27 if that's one time. Just some quantification there. Thank you.
Michael Miebach:
Right. Hey, Bryan. So on the share side, so first of all, I tried to lay out that we have a differentiated proposition overall for AgenTek Commerce. So we hope to be positioned well with partners out there who look to get into the space and work with us. Now the share part that you were talking about is beyond services goes into the payment side as well. So one thing that I think is a pretty obvious opportunity is this is going to be very hard to do for local payment networks. So if you look around the various kind of local payment systems that exist in Europe and Asia, and so forth.
Big markets for us is an opportunity for us to continue to drive up our switching ratio as we've done in years, and this gives us another kind of feel to execute on. I think that's the first thing to say.
There's another aspect here on where we'll have to see how it works from a share perspective, but the general nature of AgenTek Commerce driving more transactions is a good opportunity for us to drive share to start with because what might have been one basket at one merchant might now be a very, broader set of recommendations from a bot that gives us multiplicity of opportunity to get into the flow and provide the kind of solution that helps us get this over to us.
I think one other thing to keep in mind is kind of when you look at the GenTeq and you think back about the days where everything was in store, and what kind of services portfolio we had and the opportunities we had to apply, services and drive differentiation for us versus others. And then it went online. That was a whole different set of solutions. That were suddenly needed to keep the online transaction safe. And at GenTick, it's going to be even more opportunity for us to do that. So those are all lenses on how we look at it.
Most tangible near-term one would really be as this plays out, not near-term as in the next month, but near-term as in the next year possibly when AgenTek Harm really gets momentum to compete versus local payment solutions.
Sachin Mehra:
Yeah. And on Capital One, like I said, look, I mean, the conversion's underway. We expect conversion to complete in 2026. I mentioned that there is an offset to the net revenue loss as part of the conversion. You should not assume that the offset completely negates the impact of the lost net revenue. I'm not going to size for you exactly what the amount is that we're expecting in 2026. But it is fair to assume that the headwind in 2027 will be there because you no longer have the benefit of that contractual obligation offsetting in 2027.
So if you're looking on a year-over-year basis, what you're going to see is going to see an adverse impact in 2026 by virtue of this conversion. And then on a year-over-year basis, you will see in 2027 an adverse impact as well. Just because the contractual obligation is no longer benefiting us in 2027.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Harshita Rawat:
Hi, good morning. Michael, I want to ask about Mastercard Commerce Media. Can you expand upon the announcement? It looks like you're bringing together a lot of your across offers, loyalty, personalization. Maybe talk about the early feedback from advertisers you've received distribution channels, how will it work, and does Elise also talked about kind of, like, a high return on ad spend? Can it sustain at these levels of this game? Thank you.
Michael Miebach:
Right. Thank you, Harshita. So from the data, the plastered Times Square with Commerce Media. A lot has happened. So we were out there with advertisers. We're out there with publishers. So those are the both kind of parties in this ecosystem. Today, how that industry works is kind of one of the problems to solve is can you really attribute the ad spend? And this is one of the problems that we can solve here. Because we can tie it to a specific transaction, specific purchase that went through our network. So that brings us a different, you know, gives us a different starting position for all of this.
Know, when you go and you want to enable somebody to place the right app in the right ad at the right time, you need more data to do that. And we do have proprietary spend data and insights from our permission 500 million consumers that sit in our loyalty programs and 25,000 merchants. That is a very unique position that we are in. Other competitors have are other players out there who haven't been in this business. We've been in loyalty for a long time, and we just started to look at this. This is a whole different approach for us to get into business that go straight beyond the payment transaction. As I framed it earlier on.
So the initial reception is interested. We have a set of big players on both sides of the equation that I mentioned advertisers and publishers who are engaging with us to drive this. But it's also pretty early days when we launched it. So can't really have anything to share from a numbers perspective other than there's demand, let's go and do this because the proposition is pretty clear.
Harshita Rawat:
Thanks.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tien-Tsin Huang:
Hi. Nice results, of course. Just following up a few of the questions asked already. Just thinking about this build versus buy for Mastercard. And Michael, your comment on carefully curating the vast portfolio. On the build side, it feels like you've announced a few things, cloud platform. Harshita just asked about the commerce media network. Are these the recent build projects? Are they moving the needle in VAST in the near term from your perspective? And on the buy side, there were some press reports about Mastercard's interest in crypto. Infrastructure. Can you comment on that and just your appetite in general for infrastructure versus services assets? Thanks.
Michael Miebach:
Alright. So, you know, Mastercard has been, you know, you know, organic innovation and so forth. And we have been very good at that over time. But we've also been very focused on, you know, leveraging acquisition lever whenever we could. And whenever it makes sense strategy-led as Sachin talked about earlier. So somewhere in the middle is where you find some of these recent announcements like commerce what Harshita just talked about. You know, I see that's a pretty big bet for us. It's a really unique position that we bring to the party. There is clear interest in the market. So we feel this is something that will make a difference. Otherwise, we wouldn't do it.
But it's also early days. And there isn't just one big bet. So there's a few things that we're given and trying at any given point in time that get some preferential funding in the company and so forth that we push. That's a discipline that we've built out over years, on top of our everyday organic innovation. So commerce media on demand decisioning, as I and a few others that are coming. So that's been a strong quarter.
We felt like rather than giving you bits and every quarter, we thought we'll take this quarter and put it everything together that you show to show you that the innovation must feel is all well and it's not just about buying companies out there. Now we are not commenting on market rumors. You would have not expected me to say anything else. Yes. I saw that article as well.
Tien-Tsin Huang:
Fair enough.
Michael Miebach:
Thank you, Michael.
Operator:
Next question comes from Andrew Schmidt from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andrew Schmidt:
Hi, Michael. Hi, Sachin. Thanks for taking the question this morning. I wanted to ask on cross-border. Cross-border volume has been remarkably resilient. And very consistent here. Maybe just comment on the sustainability the drivers of sustainability on a go-forward basis. And then if we peel back the layers for both card not present and travel, card not present, card present travel, does anything to call out in terms of verticals, corridors, that's worth mentioning in terms of shifts you're seeing?
Sachin Mehra:
Sure, Andrew. I'll take that. So look, I mean, just to set the stage for cross-border, right? The value prop on cross-border continues to resonate. Across the consumer base as well as across businesses, right. I mean cross-border is a combination of consumer spend as well as business spend, which is taking place there. And that value prop is alive and well and people are using it and leveraging it and they see some significant benefits as a result of that. That in combination with winning the right portfolios is what we focus a lot on, which is winning the right kinds of portfolios, which could be cross-border heavy affluent portfolios, case in point, Michael talked about Japan Airlines, right?
Great example, when you win a co-brand portfolio or for example, the renewal with American Airlines, these are important portfolios to win because they actually help sustain that growth rate on cross-border because when people buy take those products, they're actually using them in the cross-border environment. So winning the right portfolios is important. Number two, it's the effort which goes into the daily blocking and tackling to drive cross-border volumes, right? We have a team inside of Mastercard, which actually spends a lot of time focusing on pulling the right levers to drive optimization of cross-border flows. Because it's not as easy as it sounds, right?
And very often what happens is you've got to stimulate spend in the acquiring corridor that people pull out their 20% growth on card not present ex travel. For cross-border. Look, I mean, it's all the things that we do every day to execute on that to be present and have our acceptance available in those cross-border channels, which makes that come to life. That is partially also sustained by something which Michael talked about earlier. He talked about how Mastercard products are used in the on-ramp for stablecoins and for crypto. Well, that comes into card not present ex travel. So when you have that kind of growth coming through there, coming through in these metrics as well.
So overall I would tell you, I won't give you a forecast. I know you're looking for that. I will tell you that the underlying fundamentals of what drives our cross-border volumes is very much intact.
Andrew Schmidt:
Thank you, Sachin.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tim Chiodo:
Great. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit more about that cross-border acceptance. So when either Mastercard or maybe an attempt by another local or another competitor looks to build out that global acceptance. I was hoping you could talk through what do you need to do that. Right? Is it things like licenses, relationships with merchants and PSPs or acquirers? There's a branding aspect. There's customer awareness. Probably a bunch of infrastructure investment. If you could just elaborate on just how much of a moat and how challenging that is?
Then lastly, somewhat related, to what extent do you think it's possible, and some have done this, that competitors could more partner on this rather than build it out on their own? And what the difference is in the two approaches. Thanks a lot.
Michael Miebach:
Right. So, it sounds like you worked in our industry for a while. Because you just gave a good part of what it takes to do this. If you take a step back and look at the list that you just talked about, it just tells you it's hard to do. It's difficult to do and took a long time to build it. So that's important. Different players have tried to replicate some of that and it continues to be the better proposition that's out there. It's driving a lot of value because it with one 100, 50,000,000 acceptance points, whatever the latest number is, it is very hard to replicate.
And for us as a company, you know, we're well positioned with our domestic license in China to continue to drive that footprint. The complexities that come in is indeed you have to be a global player and act local. Understand the local regulatory system, you have to understand the local partners because remember, we are the global fabric that sits on top of We're not doing the last mile of this. And this is why it's really important for us to continue to build partnerships around the world that drive the cross-border acceptance. But you gotta help them, you know, drive preference for us.
You gotta ensure that the user experience that they provide to the consumer at the point of interaction is a compelling one. It's easy. It's all that. And it's delivering the standards that we put out for us to ensure that the Mastercard transaction actually comes through. And one of the most critical things about all of this is that in the end, you need to have to ensure safety and security because as people worry that what happens if something goes wrong? Where's my data going? What happens if this transaction is a fraudulent one, etcetera, etcetera? Those are all aspects of this.
And by the way, they reflect a good chunk of our services portfolio that we also offer to those partners that drive that acceptance for us in market. So all of this comes together. So yes, I think it's hard to do. There will be others that come at it. And so far, I think this is just the most differentiated proposition that's out there. Earlier, there are different cross-border solutions for different types of payments that we're also active in because it's not just P2M. There's Mastercard Move, where you have B2C disbursements and gig work payouts and so forth. So we're doing that.
Leveraging our network in bidirectional ways to do the same thing to keep this a resilient proposition. Can you just repeat the second part of your question? There was a particular angle you were after.
Tim Chiodo:
Oh, sure. It was around the ability to do this by partnering with other networks rather than building it on your own and to what extent you thought there was maybe a quality or other differences. Yeah.
Michael Miebach:
You know, there's other networks is an interesting angle. Let me talk about where we see partnership opportunity, and I talked about that with digital wallets. So this is right now a particular opportunity. There's a clear trend that in some parts of the world, people love wallets. For a range of reasons. The stored value, digital wallets that I mentioned with Alipay Plus and so forth out in Asia. That is a great partnership because they provide a particular local solution, be global acceptance, the combination of that makes a great opportunity for partnership. General processors, acquirers, those are different types of partners. There, occasionally, we see competition coming in, but it's pretty clear.
We that for us, have a need to find ways to partner with people that can cover the last mile for us. So it's never an either-or always look for opportunities even for people where in certain pockets we do compete. We'll find other ways to partner to drive this the reach of our network.
Sachin Mehra:
Yes. And I'll just add, Tim, to that point, which Michael made. Look, at the end of the day, right, when we build out acceptance, we're building our acceptance both for domestic and cross-border. It's not like you're exclusively building our acceptance across. So back to your question around the sustainability and how difficult or not it is for others to compete, it's a question of what your global footprint is. And we've got thriving domestic businesses in many, many, many countries across the globe where we built out the acceptance footprint, right? That serves us not only in the domestic volumes but certainly serves us from a cross-border standpoint as well.
Michael Miebach:
Every transaction starts somewhere.
Sachin Mehra:
Domestically.
Tim Chiodo:
Excellent. Thank you both.
Operator:
Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Sanjay Sakhrani:
Thank you. So pricing Sachin you mentioned it as well. Has been a tailwind this year. I'm just curious can that trend continue in 2026 to a similar degree? I guess also when I think about it, that core payments business, like, you think there's still decent pricing power there? And then just I have one quick follow-up on the Capital One data disclosure. I'm just trying to think about the step down in volumes sequentially. That seems like a significant number given how early the Cap One transition is. Maybe you could just help us think about that. I know the revenues are separate. I'm not necessarily as concerned about that.
I'm just thinking about the optics of the volumes.
Sachin Mehra:
Thank you. But maybe you could just speak a little bit about what we should expect as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year in terms of the magnitude of impact on U.S. Volumes?
Sachin Mehra:
I'll take both questions here. On Capital One, right? So remember when I was talking about the first four weeks, of October on U.S. Volumes, right, It's certainly the Capital One piece as well as the lapping effect due to weather impacts we had in 2024. So it's a combination of both of those. Which reflects on the 8% number that you're seeing in Q3. Going to 5%. It's important to also look at what the growth rate in September was because 8% is the average across all of Q3. So it's kind of this step change which takes place as cars migrate that you're going to start to see the volume come.
And candidly, I mean, cars are migrating over. And they will continue to. Through the course of the fourth quarter and going into the early part of next year. So I like at the end of the day, that's something which is just the reality that's well understood, that's well contemplated in every bit of guidance that I've shared on 2025. I've kind of given you a little bit of a look into what the puts and takes for 2026 are as it relates to Capital One as well.
Michael Miebach:
Can just say one thing? Sure. So there are a few questions on Capital One. And, of course, that's, you know, Capital One is an important partnership, but it's not the only partner we have in the U.S. So we keep winning on the other side. And if you zoom out and you look at it from a global perspective, you know, as a truly global company, you know, like, have 27,000 bank partners. And we win a lot. Our share has been up, which we shared with you at the investor day. So there's a lot of winning going on, and I think it's always good to keep that perspective.
There will be shifts and puts and takes here and there, but overall, the trend's been pretty positive, and we continue to win.
Sachin Mehra:
Sanjay, on your question on pricing, look, I mean, the end of the day, if we do our job right, right, there's no reason why we cannot price for the value we deliver. We continue to deliver new products in the market. We can deliver incremental value in existing products and we price for that. And so if we continue to do our job right, as we've done this year, we'll do ensuing years, we feel like there's an opportunity both across the payment network side of the business as well as value-added services and solutions. So generally feel pretty good around that.
Devin Corr:
You. Michael, any closing comments? Yes. I'd love to continue to talk, but we're just slightly over time. So thank you again for joining the call. Past hour, we covered a lot of ground together. We appreciate your support all the time, and this is all with the opportunity. Send those people to make it all happen here at Mastercard, our colleagues. So thank you to you all. And we'll talk to you again in the next quarter. You very much, and take care. Bye-bye. Thanks, everyone.

+0.73%
)
demonstrated broad-based revenue growth and continued capital return, supported by disciplined expense management and robust credit quality. Management highlighted the increased pace of digital engagement, with substantial investment in AI and technology platforms helping drive operational efficiencies and product innovation.

Borthwick stated, ""Provision expense for the quarter was $1.6 billion with asset quality remaining in great shape.""
Moynihan indicated a planned move to a 50-basis-point capital buffer, reflecting intent to deploy excess capital into growth or further shareholder returns, as regulatory developments warrant.
Expense growth comprised higher incentives linked to wealth management and markets businesses, regulatory compliance efforts, and inflationary pressures, but management expects the cost trajectory to flatten or tick lower as revenue-related expenses normalize in the second half of 2025.
Executives detailed active capital reallocation to the Global Markets segment, citing increased returns and the absence of a fixed ceiling, provided that return-on-assets and allocated capital remain compelling.
AI investments are producing measurable operational benefits, such as Erica enabling over 58 million client interactions per month and achieving 90% employee utilization, and AI-driven code generation now saving 10%-15% of programming costs.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Lee McIntyre:
With that, Brian, I will turn the call over to you. Good morning, and thank all of you for joining us for our second quarter 2025 earnings results. First, a couple of words on the environment. We continue to see solid consumer spending data, as you can see on our page 21 of the deck. Improving credit quality that Alastair Borthwick talked about from already strong statistics. Plenty of household net worth growth in the market growth and also the account balances again staying strong above where they were pre-pandemic. We see solid commercial loan growth and we see good credit quality with the exception of CRE in office, which we will talk about.
We also see our clients continue to seek clarity with the changes in trade and tariffs and now with the tax bill passing. We can see them start to understand the future and expect them to behave accordingly. We saw improving market conditions during the quarter and that leads our worldwide leading research team to continue to predict no recession. A modestly growing economy at about 1.5% at the end of the year. And continued no Fed rate cuts till next year. So with that backdrop, we talk about our second quarter. Key points on the second quarter as follows. We produced another solid quarter of revenue growth, earnings, and returns.
These earnings are driven by strong organic growth across all the businesses. The third is we continue to drive technology innovation both on the product side that we offer our customers also on the operational excellence side. We are continuing to see the benefits of our long-term investment in technology, capabilities, digitization, machine learning, now we are starting to see at the beginnings at the AI practices that we develop pay off. And we are looking forward to much more. On Slide two, we start the earnings discussion. This morning we reported revenue of $26.6 billion on an FTE basis net income of $7.1 billion after tax. And earnings per share of $0.89 for the second quarter.
On a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue 4% and grew earnings per share 7%. We produced a return on assets of 83 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 13.4% in the second quarter. We have produced $14.8 billion in NII, a record for the company. Growing 7% from the second quarter in 2024. This represents the fourth quarter of NII growth in line with the guidance we have been giving you. Supporting that average deposits have now grown for eight consecutive quarters and we have achieved this while maintaining very disciplined deposit pricing. That is great work by our teams.
Markets related revenue gained momentum throughout the quarter, We recorded our thirteenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and trading growth. Jim DeBarr and the team continue to do a good job there. Revenue was up 15% over the prior year quarter. We also produced more than $1.4 billion in firm-wide investment banking fees, and the better quarterly results improved as each month of the quarter progressed. We reported expense below $17.2 billion this quarter, $600 million lower than the first quarter of 2025 in line with the expectations we gave you. We reported our sixth consecutive quarter of net charge-offs at around the $1.5 billion level. This is a little bit of a tale of two cities.
Consumer net charge-offs were lower. Offsetting that we had elevated commercial real estate office charge-offs. We resolved a number of credits in this quarter in the second quarter. When those credits close in the third quarter, you will see the reduction in NPLs related thereto. The good news is that most of those second quarter charge-offs were previously reserved it had a modest impact on our profitability for the quarter. We provided capital in support of our customers and clients to help them grow. For example, we delivered strong commercial loan growth as you can see. We also provided more balance sheet to our institutional clients for their financing needs.
At the same time, we also increased the capital return to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased $5.3 billion in shares and paid $2 billion in dividends. The first half of 2025, we have returned $13.7 billion in total capital 40% higher than the first half of 2024. Tangible book value per share continued to grow this quarter. Let's move our discussion to organic growth. You can see that on slide three. We added new clients and deeper relationships with our existing clients. That was across all our businesses, consumer wealth, commercial and our markets business. Our teams are winning in the marketplace by putting the client first.
For example, in consumer banking, continue to grow primary checking accounts. We grew average consumer deposits for a third consecutive quarter. Balances are up year over year for the first time since 2022, up putting the effects of the pandemic surges behind us. This quarter we crossed the milestone of 5 million net new checking accounts over the last six years. We saw increases in average consumer checking account balance of our clients for two consecutive quarters and now the average balance per account is over $9,200 and 92% of the primary checking account in the household. On the investment side, our clients carry an average funded balance of more than $130,000 strong when compared to the industry.
Our home and auto originations grew on a year-over-year basis this quarter. We continue to be a leading supplier of credit to small businesses helping the core segment economy grow. Loans were once again up year over year and reflecting the commitment to add more bankers in markets that we serve across United States. In wealth and investment management client balances reached $4.4 trillion saw strong AUM flows and loan demand as well as market appreciation. Our advisors continue to deliver comprehensive banking solutions to help our clients achieve their goals. In our global banking business, client activity remains solid.
Commercial clients are actively using their credit facilities albeit at still a lower level than they used them as a percentage prior to pandemic and our risk management approach remains very disciplined. We added more than 1,000 net new clients most of them driven by our payments capabilities. Global markets continue to perform well with a record second quarter level of sales and trading revenue. Institutional clients sought funding of their warehouse of loans and other needs at increased pace with high-quality collateral. Organic growth means that we are also investing in our own capabilities, people and our technology to serve our clients more effectively.
Those investments have led to continued expansion in digitalization and engagement across all our lines of business. Nearly 80% of our consumer households are now fully digitally engaged. And they have benefited from our award-winning platforms. Just to give you a sense of the volumes, in the second quarter alone 4 billion logins were made by our consumer. In the second quarter, 65% of our consumer product sales were digital. You can see all these trends in our disclosures on Slides 24, 26, and 28 appendix. I commend you to review them to see how the technology application can be scaled and applied across the businesses.
We also continue to invest in our teammates and are moving more money into the AI side and machine learning side. And as we think about the quarters ahead, and the operating leverage you are turning in the company, due to the NII growth. It is key to note we have fully absorbed the cost of the last several years of inflation and wages over inflation and wages and other third-party provided services. Fifteen years ago, to make it an understanding how much an impact technologies had, fifteen years ago the company had a headcount of 300,000. Today, have 212,000. We did that with a relentless application of scalable, secure, resilient technologies.
Customer behavior also changed and matched digitization simplification of products, machine learning and models and process improvements helped us get there. Now we have a chance to capture the value that with the new enhanced capabilities of AI machine learning. Artificial intelligence allows us to change the work across many more areas of our company, effective than prior tools allowed us. We have deep scaling experience in AI capabilities. With Eric, our AI assistant is the most recognized aspect of that. As you can see on Slide four, we think about the way we apply artificial intelligence and augmented intelligence in four different pillars. AI agents search and summarization, content generation importantly coding and automated processes.
First off, as an example, is our virtual assistant Erica. This is a model we introduced back in 2018 and developed prior to that. It was a first true banking industry, virtual agent. It averages over 58 million interactions per month. Today, helping to make it easier for clients to bank how they want and where they want. We also leveraged Erica capabilities for use of our commercial clients in CashPro, as well as with our employees in Erica for employees. To give you a sense, 90% of our more than 210,000 teammates have now utilized Erica for employees to complete such tasks as password updates, equipment refreshes, etcetera.
In wealth management and our other relationship management banking businesses, AI is helping those relationship managers and advisors search and summarize information preparing them to deliver personalized planning and personalized pitches to clients for their business and help with their advice. Copilots help them organize the prospecting process and all this is implemented in going through the system. In our operations group, AI tools help improve our process around customer satisfaction. One chat-based AI product works between markets and operations allows us to have 750 people engaged with AI agents to allow them reconcile trades which has saved many FTE already.
In addition, as you can see, we have 17,000 programmers using AI coding technology today saving 10% to 15% in code generation costs and we expect that to continue to rise. Overall, we have 1,400 AI patents and have created over 250 AI and learning models in the company. We are currently working through many dozens of our AI proof of concepts beyond what I just spoke about. These investments are intended to help growth improve the client experience and our own productivity. So if you think about the quarter before I turn it over to Alistair, just a few points. We saw good organic client activity. We enjoyed good growth in revenue and earnings per share.
We continue to invest in that growth and are beginning to see the impacts of AI again aiding our efficiency. We manage risk well that drove healthy returns and we kept delivering more capital back to use our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Alistair.
Brian Moynihan:
All right. Well, thank you, Brian. I am going to skip slide five the earnings presentation since Brian covered most of that already. And I just want to provide a little more context on the highlights of the quarter starting on Slide six. Where you can see revenue of $26.6 billion on an F basis grew more than 4% from second quarter last year. Now we saw the year-over-year revenue growth in several areas. NII grew 7%, and represented 55% of total revenue. Investment and brokerage fees rose 11% with both assets under management flows and market levels contributing nicely to the growth. This quarter's $5.4 billion of sales and trading revenue grew 15% from the year-ago period.
Service charges grew 7% with particular strength in Global Payment Solutions. And card income improved 4%. And while investment banking was down 9% from the second quarter of 2024, momentum built across the quarter with a good pipeline. Non-interest expense was a little less than $17.2 billion and down nearly $600 million from Q1 driven by the absence of Q1 seasonal elevation in payroll taxes. Provision expense for the quarter was $1.6 billion with asset quality remaining in great shape. And we reduced our outstanding shares by almost 4% from the second quarter of last year, So together these things resulted in earnings per share improving 7% year over year.
Let's transfer to a discussion of the balance sheet using slide seven. And here total assets ended the quarter at $3.44 trillion that is up $92 billion from Q1 driven by strong loan growth and a higher level of client activity in global markets. Deposits were up $22 billion on an end of period basis from Q1 and up a little more than $100 billion from the year-ago period. Deposits reflect the seasonal headwind from income tax payments, And so inflows that more than offset the tax payment activity. Average global liquidity sources of $938 billion remain strong.
Shareholders' equity at €300 billion was up €4 billion from last year as we issued $3 billion of preferred stock this quarter, to replace redemptions from last quarter and we saw modest improvement in AOCI. Otherwise, net income was offset by distributions of capital to shareholders. We returned $7.3 billion of capital back to shareholders with $2 billion in common dividends paid and $5.3 billion of shares repurchased. With regard to dividends, as we noted in our July 1 press release following the CCAR results, we announced our plan to increase our common quarterly dividend by 8% starting in September pending board approval.
We were pleased to see our stress capital buffer requirement move lower in the results And it was good to see some of the industry comments about the annual exam coming through the new proposals. Tangible book value per share of $27.71 rose 9% from a year ago looking at regulatory capital, our CET1 level remains stable at $2.00 billion and the ratio is 11.5%. That's down 26 basis points and remains well above our regulatory minimum today which will move lower upon finalization of the new stress capital buffer from CCAR. As well as the newly proposed rules. Now, our calculated stress capital buffer and related CET1 ratio from CCAR is 10%. And that takes effect on October 1.
Through the newly proposed roles, which include two-year averaging of CET1 depletion our CET1 ratio would be 10.2% and would be effective on 01/01/1926, Either way, we have a lot of flexibility. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 5.7% versus a minimum requirement of 5% and that leaves plenty capacity for balance sheet growth and we have $473 billion of total loss absorbing capital which means our TLAC ratio remains comfortably above our requirements. On slide eight, we show a nine-quarter trend of average deposits, to illustrate the growth across those periods. Deposits are now 9% higher than their bottom in May of 2023. And that momentum continued as we average $2 trillion for the July.
Typically, see downward pressure on deposits as we move from Q1 to Q2, as clients pay their income taxes. And this year we had enough growth to more than offset those tax payments. Average consumer deposits rose $4 billion from Q1, concentrated in non-interest bearing. We also saw significant growth in global banking deposits $28 billion or 5% from Q1 and this included some shorter-term deposits from deal-related activity. And that allowed us to outpace the tax payment related declines in our wealth business as well as corporate CD placements that matured with our institutional clients. In addition, we remained disciplined on pricing to achieve that growth. Overall rate paid on total deposits declined three basis points.
Led by a three basis point decline in consumer. And the rate paid on $952 billion of consumer deposits was 58 basis points in the second quarter. Let's turn to loans by looking at the average balances on slide nine. Loans in the second quarter of $1.13 trillion improved 7% year over year driven by 10% commercial loan growth. Every business segment recorded higher average loans on both a year-over-year basis and a linked quarter basis. Drilling down on commercial loans, we saw linked quarter growth in every segment of the commercial lending spectrum. Small business and business banking both grew and we recently combined the coverage model here to provide more calling capacity for our bankers.
In middle market lending, we saw a nice increase in revolver utilization during the quarter as clients navigated the current environment. And in GCIB, we had a little more demand from our larger corporate clients. Global markets, we have been able to take advantage of strong financing demand in the market marketplace from institutional borrowers, we lend against diversified collateral pools. Now, the largest growth areas year over year have been in asset-based securitization, and in credit. And in ABS, we are providing financing solutions for corporate and asset manager clients collateralized by loan, lease or other receivables portfolios.
In credit, we provide term and warehouse financing collateralized by diversified pools of corporate loans for private credit and asset manager clients. We feel very good about the lending and we feel good about the growth opportunity in these areas And our expertise has enabled us to participate in a number of attractive deals. Let's turn our focus to NII performance on slide 10. On a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q2 was $14.7 billion and on a fully taxable equivalent basis, NII was $14.8 billion and as I said earlier, that's up 7% from the second quarter.
NII grew $227 million on a fully taxable equivalent basis over Q1, driven by higher loan and deposit balances one additional day of interest, and fixed rate asset repricing. Lower loan yields from lower foreign interest rates partially offset those positive contributors. The net interest yield or NIY declined five basis points reflecting a roughly $80 billion increase in earning assets driven by global markets activity. Loans and trading assets generated in global markets contribute solid net interest income but at a lower relative yield to the overall company. Net interest yield. Additionally, some of the deal-related commercial deposit growth with relationship clients was net interest income accretive and modestly net interest yield dilutive.
My point here is that net interest income growth continues to be the focus with net interest yield being an output. With regard to interest rate sensitivity on a dynamic deposit basis, we provide a twelve-month change in net interest income. For an instantaneous shift in the curve. That means interest rates would have to move instantly another 100 basis points lower than the expected cuts contemplated in the current curve. And on that basis a 100 basis point decline would decrease NII over the next twelve months by $2.3 billion and if rates went up by 100 basis points, net interest income would benefit roughly $1 billion. Let me turn to a forward view of NII.
Let's turn to Slide 11. And there remains a good amount of uncertainty from the impacts related to announced tariffs and the potential for continued uncertainty. Also seen volatility in expectations of future interest rate cuts, So let us give you a few thoughts about the rest of 2025. In January, and again in April, we provided our expectations that we could exit the fourth quarter of 2025 with interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis in a range of $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion also noted our expectation that growth would accelerate in the second half of 2025. Our expectation for the exit rate of NII in the fourth quarter remains unchanged.
And the drivers of the improvement remain largely the same as those we have discussed. We will pick up one additional day of interest Additionally, fixed rate asset repricing of assets and cash flow swaps is expected to provide the biggest near-term benefits to our NII and that takes into account the impact of the current interest rate curve. Loan and deposit activity is anticipated to also aid second half NII growth. And lastly, global markets businesses also expected to benefit NII a touch from lower rates as we move through the year.
Bottom line is our range of NII expectation for the fourth quarter of year remains unchanged at $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion and that would result in record NII and a full year NII improvement of 6% to 7%. Okay, let's turn to expense and use slide 12 for the discussion there. We reported a little less than $17.2 billion in expense this quarter and this reflects a nearly $600 million decline from Q1 driven by the absence of seasonal elevation from payroll tax expense modestly lower litigation costs. Expense compared to the second quarter of last year is up a little more than 5%. That increase reflects an aggregated 9% improvement in wealth management fees.
Higher sales and trading revenue, and investment banking fees. It also reflects the impact of ongoing inflationary costs and continued investments in people and technology. Inflation is evident across our employee costs of healthcare, hardware and leased space among many other areas. On the people side, we continue to be an employer of choice with a strong 92% retention rate among our employees. And this quarter, we welcome more than 1,700 interns and our headcount excluding those summer additions has fallen 1,500 from the beginning of the year proving that we continue to manage our headcount effectively and the associated expense. Next quarter we will bring on more than 2,000 campus graduates to begin their careers.
As we move through the back half of the year, we believe expenses will flatten out here and potentially move a touch lower if we see seasonally lower markets related costs. That coupled with the expectation of improved NII is anticipated to provide operating leverage in the second half of the year and an improved efficiency ratio. Let's move to credit. We will turn to slide 13, where you can see that asset quality remains sound. Net charge-offs were $1.5 billion up modestly compared to Q1, and that's the sixth consecutive quarter that net charge-offs have hovered around $1.5 billion. The total net charge-off ratio this quarter was 55 basis points up a basis point from the first quarter.
Q2 provision expense was $1.6 billion and mostly matched the net charge-offs Modest reserve builds in some areas primarily for loan growth were mostly offset by releases associated with lower office exposures and mainly from sales. Consumer net charge-offs were $1.1 billion down modestly linked quarter and consistent with the past few quarters. 90% of our consumer net charge-offs are driven by credit card, that highlights the importance of prudence in the underwriting growth of that portfolio. It's worth noting the net loss rate on credit card declined year over year for the first time this quarter since early 2016 outside of the pandemic period.
On the commercial side, we saw losses of $466 million that's up from Q1 driven primarily by office exposures and their associated sales as I noted earlier. Net charge-off ratio for total commercial loans remained low at 29 basis points this quarter. Importantly, our C and I book commercial and industrial so that excludes the small business and CRO CRE loans. That commercial and industrial loan book is $564 billion and the loss on this book was nine basis points this quarter. It's averaged eight basis points from 2013 until now.
Focusing on total net charge-offs again and looking forward in the near term, we would not expect much change in the total net charge-off ratio given the steadiness of consumer delinquencies stability of C and I and the reductions in our CRE office exposures. On slide 14, in addition to the lower consumer delinquency statistics, note the modest changes in other stats for both our consumer and commercial portfolios. Okay, let's move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results. Starting on slide 15 with consumer banking. Consumer delivered strong results with $10.8 billion in revenue that grew 6% year over year and $3 billion in net income that grew 15%.
Results were driven by the increasing value of our low-cost deposit franchise. Innovation and deposit products like family banking, and new higher value cash back credit cards coupled with our industry-leading preferred rewards program deliver total value for clients which we believe do not get elsewhere. This value recognition and disciplined pricing also drove a 7% improvement in NII. The revenue growth was led by the NII improvement, it also included solid fee performance in card income and service charges. And through good expense management we drove 400 basis points of operating leverage in the business as expense growth year over year rose only 2% compared to the 6% revenue growth.
The efficiency ratio improved more than 200 basis points in the last twelve months to 51% in the quarter. Investment balances grew 13 percent $540 billion with market improvement and full year flows of $19 billion And as I noted earlier, consumer net charge-offs improved linked quarter following the move lower in delinquencies. The loss on credit card fell 23 basis points to 3.82% and delinquencies declined for the second consecutive quarter. And finally, you can see in the appendix on slide 24, digital adoption and engagement continue to improve and customer experience scores rose to record levels illustrating clients appreciation of enhanced capabilities from our investments.
Moving to wealth management on slide 16, the business delivered another solid quarter where we added new households, deepened existing relationships, and saw strong client flows. The business generated net income of a billion dollars on strong loan growth and solid AUM flows. We saw modest decline in net income a solid revenue growth was more than offset by higher revenue related costs and continued investments to build the business. Merrill and the private bank now manage nearly $4.4 trillion in client balances and continue to see organic growth that produce strong AUM flows of $82 billion in the past year contributing nearly 5% growth in AUM balances.
That all reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work. During the quarter between Merrill and the private bank, added 7,100 net new relationships, and in both businesses, the size of the relationships added continued to expand. Also continue to add financial advisors to the sales force in Merrill, and the private bank through our extensive training program and experienced higher hiring of advisors. Approximately one-third of net new households in Q2 were added by our newly trained. We are not only growing relationships, but we are also deepening as the number of clients that have banking products with us to nearly 63%.
And while this is primarily a fee-based advice-driven model, about 30% of our revenue is now net interest income derived from GWIM clients and the large loan and deposit balances on us. In Q2, we reported revenue of $5.9 billion growing nearly 7% over the prior year led by that 9% growth in asset management fees. Expense growth of 9% supported both the cost of the increase in revenue related incentives as well as investment in technology and cost of hiring to add experienced advisors to the platform in Merrill and the private bank. Average loans were up 7% year over year driven by strong growth in custom lending, securities-based lending and a pickup in mortgage lending.
Saw solid deposit inflows and overall deposits declined as a result of the seasonal headwind of income tax payments. And some continued movements to other parts of our investment platform in search of higher yield. Our pricing discipline resulted in a three basis point decline in rate paid. We also draw your attention on slide 26 to the continued digital momentum in this business. New accounts continue to be opened predominantly digitally. Slide 17 shows the global banking results where the prior year rate impacts lowered NII. And this segment has the toughest challenge to make that ground back through growth and pricing.
In Q2, Global Banking generated net income of $1.7 billion Business activity was solid in Q2, We already discussed the strong deposit growth solid loan growth and investment banking fees that gained momentum through the quarter. While business activity was solid, overall net income fell. NII declined year over year from lower rates on the variable loans, and higher funding costs for loan growth. Non-interest income included both lower investment banking fees and lower solar and wind investment activity. Non-interest expense to support the business activity grew as we increased investment for the future with more relationship managers across the commercial spectrum and we invested in technology and marketing.
Firm-wide investment banking fees were $1.4 billion in Q2 down 9% from a year ago led by a decline in M and A and leverage finance fees. We still maintained our number three investment banking fee position year to date. Switching to global markets on slide 18, I will focus my comments on results excluding DVA as I normally do. And as Brian said, we continued our streak of strong revenue and earnings performance achieved operating leverage, and once again delivered a good return on capital. In Q2, we generated net income of $1.6 billion which grew 11% year over year.
Revenue, and again this is ex DVA, improved 10% from the second quarter of last year, on good sales and trading results while investment banking was lower. Focusing on sales and trading, ex DVA, revenue improved 15% year over year. To $5.4 billion Sales and trading built off the momentum of the first quarter. FICC led the way this quarter growing 19% year over year with rates and foreign exchange trading benefiting from the macro volatility. Our equities group had a strong quarter with 10% revenue growth from both trading and financing. And both FICC and equities are benefiting from investments in the international franchise as we saw increased activity across Europe. Asia and Latin America.
Year over year expense was up 9% on revenue improvement and continued investments in the business. And on slide 19, all other shows a loss of $77 million in Q2 with very little to talk about here. The tax rate ended at 7.4%. It was a little lower than last quarter driven by $180 million of discrete items. And excluding those $180 million of discrete items, and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy affordable housing, the effective tax rate would have been much closer to a normal corporate tax rate at approximately 24%. So with that, I will stop there Thank you everyone. And with that, we will open up for Q and A please, Chloe.
Operator:
Certainly. We will take our first question from John McDonald with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
John McDonald:
Wanted to ask about good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about retail deposit progress. Been a lot of talk about different ways to measure retail deposits share, and I know you may take issue with some of the methodologies out there. But, Brian, taking a step back, how do you look at and measure the team's progress in growing retail deposit share? And what's your report card and how you have done and what your ambitions are that front.
Brian Moynihan:
Well, in the end of the day, if you look at the consumer business with $950 billion in deposits, operated very efficiently. The cost of deposits, meaning all the cost over the deposits running under 146 basis points The total rate paid 58 basis points, 58% of the balances are in checking accounts. You know, it's a tremendous business, and we will only get more and more profitable as ANI kick in because they are the biggest beneficiary of that. So if you think about it in terms of deposit growth, we look pre-pandemics now, our team's gone from $700 billion odd numbers to $950 billion.
We have grown our deposits as a company faster than industry grew the pre-pandemic to now. 39% versus the industry, like 37% and large banks 32 And obviously, we contribute to the large bank growth rate So we feel very good about it. The key is they have grown checking accounts for five years now. They have grown retail deposits, which were influenced a lot because of our mass market customer base. Being such a big amount. By the pandemic stimulus that has all gone through the system and you are seeing the retail the consumer deposits growth three quarters in a row now.
And the key is that the average checking account balance is at 9,200 and it went into pandemic about $66,000 or 7,000. So seeing that growth. So we feel good about that. Overall, our average deposit size per branch is $500 million versus next best at 400 and the one behind that at 300. So I do not know all these methodologies. You guys can look at them. It's a lot of palaver and a lot of debate. The end of the day is we are going to deposit fast industry, and they and 90% of core checking, the checking accounts consumer satisfaction is the highest it's ever been, so we feel very good about it. Okay. Thanks, Brian.
Alastair, I wanted to follow-up on your expense commentary. Can you elaborate on the outlook for the second half? I think your prior outlook implied some improvement in the second half, and I think you just said you may or may not see that depending on the of the markets business?
Alastair Borthwick:
Well, I think what we are trying to say is it always starts with us with headcount discipline. So the headcount has been pretty flattish. We have managed that pretty well all the way through the year. We do not see any change in that So then the only variable that's that's left really is gonna be around revenue related Now we have seen pretty good growth obviously in sales and trading. Up 15% year over year. We have seen pretty good growth in AUM fees up 10%. So anticipate that any expense growth would be revenue related and that we should be pretty flattish Maybe we benefit in Q4 from seasonally slower activity?
John McDonald:
Okay. Thanks.
Operator:
We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Your line is open,
Ken Usdin:
Hey, good morning. Hey, Alistair, thanks for the update on that trajectory for the second half of the year. I am just wondering, as we move a step forward, if you can kind of just make sure we are still tracking right on that the split between the loan securities and swap repricing and whether, you know, that's step up in that bucket is linear in the third and fourth or kind of builds up as we get towards the end of the year? Thank you.
Alastair Borthwick:
I think I would use linear. Think that's probably the easiest way to think about it. We said to everyone that we thought that the second half had a little bit more in the way of fixed rate asset repricing and cash flow swap repricing than the first half of the year. That accounts for the growth being larger in the second half of the year. But it's not different between Q3 and Q4. So ought to be about the same.
Ken Usdin:
Okay. And then just on the I think we know that the and mortgage loans, but can you kind of just dig us in a little bit on cash flow hedges and what you are seeing in that? Are you still moving forward with the same strategy, off and on and how much you are picking up on those Yeah. So there's no change there at all. That's exactly what we are doing. Just as the old ones roll off with lower coupons, we are replacing them with new ones with higher coupons. No new news there. So still in that plus 150 or so range that you said last quarter?
Alastair Borthwick:
That will be true for some of the cash flow swaps this particular quarter and it will change from quarter to quarter. So our NII bridge that you can see takes that into account and when we update that quarter after quarter, we will just share that with you at the time.
Ken Usdin:
Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Alistair.
Alastair Borthwick:
Yep.
Operator:
We will move next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matt O'Connor:
Good morning. Just want to follow-up on the expenses. I guess if you kind of flat line it or flat to just down a little bit, that put you up, you know, call it 3.5% or so on a full year basis. And I think the prior guide was up 2% to 3% or the high end of two to three. Can you just kind of circle back to the cost versus what you were thinking? Previously and maybe talk about some of regulatory costs that I think are keeping a little bit higher?
Brian Moynihan:
Hey, Matt. So let's so I think you look year over year, just to give you a simple thing about of the expense growth from second quarter last year, second quarter this year, 400,000,000 of it was basically incentives in the wealth management business plus the what we call BEC and E that cost it of the markets based transaction. Activity, largely markets based. That's kind of revenue related growth, which we all cheer for growth there because that means the bottom line is growing If you flip that around, then the rest of the stuff grew at a relatively modest growth rate.
So on the if you think about it going forward, out of the orders on AML that were public, and stuff, we obviously put a 1,000 to 2,000 people to work to clean up a lot of stuff that's now tipping over. So we feel good about that as we move into second half of the year. Then frankly, overall inflation rate and expenses are starting to flatten out even though you hear a lot of talk about the inflation rate outside in general. But at the end of the day, we have got stability in terms of headcount in terms of third party rents and all that stuff is sort of flattening out. So we feel good about that.
And then the idea is then just to bring the headcount down. So if you think about it over the last fifteen years or so, we went from 300,000 people to 212,000 people. We just got to keep working that down. It would be able to maintain flat headcount across the last four or five years as we have invested heavily in the front end of the business and you expect us now with these some of these new techniques frankly make progress a little bit more faster. So we feel good about the expense trajectory, but the key is you are not going to change some of the revenue related stuff and you would not want to.
On the other stuff, you control the heck out of it.
Matt O'Connor:
Okay. So it does seem like the costs are coming a little bit higher, but I appreciate the kind of higher fees. I guess, as we think about like more sustainable expense growth, like I know there's no official guidance for next year, but just kind of talk about do you get back into that kind of just a couple percent growth or you know, how should we think about it in the longer?
Brian Moynihan:
That's that's an outsized sort of market growth or market related activity growth. Way above what a normal absorption rate would be. If we have a model, we can run the place on a couple 100 basis points net of expense growth, which is inflationary cost of 3%, 4%. And then offsetting it by a lot of activity. As the NII kicks in, you know, each quarter, we see it go growing and then growing at a little faster rate, frankly, as Alistair talked about. That's the operating leverage kicking back in. So we had five years operating leverage disrupted by the pandemic got back in.
And then the rates fall off hurt us obviously from NII as that now hit a record level this quarter in it's going to grow off of that record level. 'll see the operating leverage overall kick back in. In the size of that revenue stream in all the businesses is huge. And the company is obviously huge and that all pretty much falls the bottom line.
Matt O'Connor:
Okay. Thank you.
Operator:
We will move next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.
Gerard Cassidy:
Hi, Brian. Hi, Alistair. Hi, Gerard. Hi, you guys have had real success in having the digital adoption in your lines of businesses, and you pointed that out in the appendix slides that you referenced What do you think you could ever get the efficiency ratio back down to the pre-pandemic levels of just under 60%? Or has the business changed so much since the pandemic that over time, 59%, let's call it, may be tough to achieve, not near term, but over time?
Brian Moynihan:
So, Gerard, the one of the things that we talked about, I think there's a couple 100 basis points efficiency ratio difference due to the way the accounting treatment works for the tax incentive clean energy deals. Not the housing because it will not change, but and so to the yep. Those are now changed on the statute in the runoff. But if you look at 'nineteen and now, 100 basis points of the efficiency ratio is just we have an other income loss which hurts revenue is made up in a tax line. So the bottom line effect is still positive for the company. So that's 200 basis points difference.
Because back then, we ran about $300 million a quarter of tax benefit negative other income due to the tax exempt deals. Now we are running 900. And so you will see that close out frankly as these deals sunset. Then on top of that, the NII kicking in just because of nature of it, you will see the consumer business get you know, very, very efficient. Like it was back then just because it's an piece basically all follows the bottom line. So we feel very good about that. So yes, we will move back down and low 60s and then potentially crack through it. With obviously just the NI lift and the operating leverage lift.
But secondly, quite frankly, tax credit deals will start to run off just due to the change of statute.
Gerard Cassidy:
Great, Brian. And then as a follow-up, just a broader question for you. Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about stablecoins Can you give us your view of where you see the adoption of stablecoins going forward? And what that might have in terms of impact on payments revenues or deposit trends for Bank of America and possibly the industry?
Brian Moynihan:
Yep. So focusing on stable coins as a transactional device. You know, if it's new payment rail and we have trillions of dollars we move for our clients every day, We believe that if they want to use stablecoins to move part of that money, they will move. So consider them having an account and they can send up money in U. S. Dollars, they can also initiate transaction, have it go into euros and it could have it go into stable coins and then transact to that system. We feel both the industry and ourselves will have you know, a happy response. We have done a lot of work.
We are still trying to figure out how big or small it is because of some of the places are not big amounts of money movement. So you would expect us all to move, you expect our company to move on that. You know, in the end of day, you know, the debate will be how big a item this will be and how much more an effective payment stream it is. And there's places like small balance transfers across border that you can see the case. You can see it with sort of smart contracts and money movement. You can see it in digital native apps in app payments and stuff.
But we will be there just like we were there when we moved from checks to Zelle. And you can see that when the industry puts its mind to it, you were talking to me six or seven maybe ten years, you would say this thing called Venmo is coming on and you guys can be left behind and here we are, our Zelle payments exceed Venmo's total volumes today. The industries or multiples. It's just because you know, we can move money efficiently and we have to be aware of the attack on the payment system and we will be there to defend it.
Gerard Cassidy:
And just quickly, Brian, do you think there'd be a consortium like Zelle on stablecoins where the industry defends itself and moves forward? Or will the banks go individually?
Brian Moynihan:
I think it would be all of the above. I think they're in the commercial side, there might be applications more individually, but in a broad you need networks to make this all work. And we will partner with some of the stablecoin we already have partnerships with some of them. And so it will be a complex array and hopefully not complex to the customer,
Gerard Cassidy:
Thank you for those insights. Appreciate it.
Operator:
We will move next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Mike Mayo:
Hey, how are you doing? I feel like you served up a good meal here. I mean, the main course we do not lose sight of $2 trillion of deposits where you pay 1.76%, and that's certainly down. Quarter over quarter, year over year. The side dishes certainly look good with the NII going to escape velocity, I guess, from $14.08, you said, to $15.05 to $15.07 by the end of the year. I am still left hungry. I guess I need my dessert or something. I am just wondering why even with all that you know, improved performance, the NII guide is not even higher. Given the pace of loan growth.
You certainly see the expectations, as Alistair said, every segment of commercial lending is doing well. You seem very optimistic about that. You are also asset sensitive, and there's less rate cuts. So I guess I am whining, for some dessert, some extra. I am left hungry. Why not more?
Alastair Borthwick:
Well, Mike, you got a future as a chef. Look, I think if you go to the NII Bridge on page 11 for a minute. We put this out at the beginning of the year. There's a lot can happen in a year. And I think any of us anticipated all the various things that have happened in the course of the past six months. What's not on here, for example, is you think about international rates. They have been cut pretty significantly. That's a headwind that we do not include here. So you are absolutely right. There's some things that we have been really happy with in terms of loan growth.
There are some other places which have maybe grown a little less quickly. So, I would love I would still love to see the consumer non-interest bearing growing just a little faster. We have got some good growth but we would love to see a little bit more there. But I think the balance of all of these various inputs it all still hangs together six months later, we have removed a lot of risk from the equation, I think. And now we just have to see what happens with rates in the 6% to 7%, hopefully a record leaves you satisfied at the end of the year, but we will be working on next year's course.
In the second half. Alright. So when I go for my next meal next year, or the year after, any kind of foreshadowing of what preliminarily thinking about for next year?
Alastair Borthwick:
Well, the only thing I will say I mean, we will talk more about next year when we get into the Q4 discussion. Three months from now. But I think what we are talking about, which is the organic growth Brian's just talked about, driving the deposits and the loans that should continue The fixed rate asset repricing we are going to continue to benefit from again next year. We are trying to make sure that we are replicating and sustaining results over a long period of time.
Mike Mayo:
All right. Thank you.
Operator:
We will move next to Steven Alexopoulos from TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Steven Alexopoulos:
Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to start the conversation first. I love this AI Slide four. I might frame it actually. But to start the conversation there, as we have spoken to the banks, there seems to be a fairly wide range of how banks are thinking about AI. Some are using it really to boost productivity, others are more fully embracing it to leverage digital workers. You seem to be in the second camp if you guys saw at the JPM Investor Day where Mary Anne like put that slide up. Looking at headcount coming down about 10% or so in the consumer bank over the next five years.
Wherever that number ends up being, how should we think about your company as you leverage these tools? Should we think about you as leading fast forward to whatever JPMorgan does? I would love to hear you unpack this for us.
Brian Moynihan:
Well, let me just walk up to coverage, Stephen. But let's just step back and think about the application technology fifteen years ago, had 100,000 people in our consumer business. Today, we have 53,000. The deposits, I think at the time were say $400 billion now they are $900 plus. Numbers of checking accounts were up 50% transaction volume through the roof etcetera, etcetera. And so all that is enabled by application technology on scale, with control and resiliency. And so when you are now doing 2 billion digital interactions, you have to be up all the time. And we have invested, you know, probably $2 billion on we call never down.
Down hot, hot, hot backup so that those systems can run all time. So you do not have to We have to debate the future. You know, we do not you just look at what we have done. We are down half the people in this business. It's bigger and more complex. And more widespread etcetera. So that's that's one. As we look forward, it takes something like take something like Erica and, you know, it was developed when none of us do what a large language or small language model was. It is built, it's operating. And what I described earlier is it now does 20 million consumers use it every quarter. Actively.
They use it 60 million times a month. This is not you know, again and every one of those would have been a phone call and stuffs. We as we bring it out to wider use case, wider things it can do, and train it on as we bring it across various parts of the company, commercial business with cash pro, Erica and full employees, etcetera. You are seeing these models that are the data's carefully crafted so it works. They get the right decision. They can train them, and we are using it more places. So we just see that going and going and going.
Now meanwhile, in that consumer number, we have twice as many relationship bankers as we did at the start. So we reinvest a part of that savings to drive net checking growth on a consistent basis for five years. If you start to think about $5 million net checking accounts with $9,000 of our balance, start to do some math, you start to think that we have grown good sized bank incrementally. Over the last four or five years. So it's enables you to do that while the cost structure went down $1 billion a quarter in consumer over the time frame. So that's what happens.
They take something like this optimist model, which is a model that we built with others third party models that we have fine tuning ability for fixed income traders, is relatively bespoke still. We have one common equity, we have 300 cusps for fixed income to give you example just as our company. To allow them to reconcile trades all through using bots and agents between operation itself instead of emails and, and shared drives and everything going on. You know, it's pretty powerful. And we are just starting at 750 people.
This is you know, ninety days old for implementation, and we will see the benefits that five people so far, 10 people, you will start to see more people and we will just stop adding stop replacing headcount attrition in these areas or reapply that headcount somewhere else. So we think there's a lot to go here. And now I think I have we have got to be careful. It's got to be done right. The decisions we make are meaningful to people's lives, so it cannot be made in a way that's not correct meaning it comes up with the wrong decision.
Customers of a gaze should say, I mean, they you know, their confidence will come and go if you do not handle them right. So we have to be very careful. And that's why not a fast follower or a leader, it's can you apply it at scale. That's the question. And if you could apply it at scale, then you can get the benefits. You cannot apply it at scale, meaning it is not always up and operating, then you have and that's what we are driving at. So you will well, you will figure out in five years whether we were the leader or not the leader. We got the patents. We showed you. We got the model.
And the question is, you actually getting the benefits and the scale? We have and we will and we expect to continue. And yet still in the early stage.
Steven Alexopoulos:
Okay. That's great color. For my follow-up, just going back to your response, Brian, to Gerard's question on digital assets. As I have studied BofA, I think you were the first bank out there with a mobile app. You are the first one out there with Erica, right, the digital agent. But it seems like the way you are thinking about stablecoins is your it's a little wait and see. Right? JPM has a tokenized deposit, Citi has a tokenized deposit, I have not seen any announcement from you guys have a large cross border business right now relative to others.
So you could be the disruptor in this new ecosystem, same way you were with mobile same way you were with digital agent, Are you just skeptical on what this could mean long term? Like why not lean in with this breakthrough technology the same way you have with these others?
Brian Moynihan:
Well, you are you are forgetting that a lot of if you are gonna go to customer facing activity in this area, we had to make sure we had legal clarity. And so that's still going on as we speak and to be able to apply Look, the business cases for it as incremental value are our still to be proven, frankly. And so that's so on Bitcoin or as you go on blockchain, you know, have lots of patents. We have used it in the trade area and stuff for a lot of information going to move with money and things like that.
But we still in the end of day remember we will move 3 or $4 trillion today and all of it will be digital. You know, or 99% of it. So you know, other than the cash, LA, ATM, and the checks written by consumers, which are going down, you know, 8%, 10% year over year and a half the checks written that they were four or five years ago. Everything else in our company moves digital. And so what's the improved process? And then there's real time and that's also connected. So trying to figure that out. It's not cautious or not.
It's just what is the client demand and when we start see it we have built the capabilities. We are understanding what we do, and then we can roll it out. But the questions we are not seeing, you know, clients are knocking on door and saying, please give me this right now.
Steven Alexopoulos:
Got it. Okay.
Operator:
We will take our next question from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Wanted to just refocus the conversation and just ask Brian, with the deregulatory momentum that seems to be taking place, how do you feel about when is the appropriate time to address that 130 basis point buffer? So, you know, granted the stress the stress test has been quite volatile in the SCB result, But, you know, clearly there's reform to address that. I am wondering if 130 basis points would still be an appropriate buffer and what you need to see to rethink that buffer.
Brian Moynihan:
So, we believe in appropriate buffer is 50 basis points plus or yep. Yep. 50 basis points, and that's what we are running down to you know, pushing down before. We always want that to be utilized for lack of better word by the core businesses because that's we are here for. So we pay our dividends We are basically using all the incremental capital to repurchase shares and then letting the business use up the excess capital to grow. And at the high point, think we are 12% Now we are down to eleven five. So they are using it up. What we just did is increase the amount of which we have.
So we expect them to use that and expect us to move down to 50 basis points. Now, remember we got this debate between averaging and not averaging, we will see it happen. The SLR is really not relevant for us because it frankly other ratios would catch us before the SLR. The G SIB calibration is critically important because people forgetting that has to happen because we are effective using 2,010, 11 or 12 data on the size of the economy in our company and other companies relative size to judge how systemically important are it was meant to be indexed.
It has not been the proposal was indexed to the rich the year ago or so from then on, that really right because it skips all the run up in size at the pandemic. So we have to see more of this come together Expect us to work that capital down one way or the other way. But we are always trying to grow the company. And that's what that extra capital there is to grow the grow the company loans deposit you know, loans more interactions, more transactions. The balance sheet markets is growing and they have done a good job returning on it. So that's what we keep doing. So back up 50 basis points is target buffers.
We just got a change in the last few weeks The change is still being debated about the implementation timing. We got to get the GSIP thing figured out because if they do not index it we will have an increase coming at us in another year or so. And all this we are working on but the end of the day is we have just returned all the capital we earned back to the shareholders and we will continue to do that and more if the business cannot use to grow.
Operator:
Got it. And just my follow-up question here, Ryan, is are there businesses that you are prioritizing in terms of redeploying that capital to that perhaps you know, where the profitability looks better under this regime. And the $5.3 billion of stock that you bought back this quarter, would that be indicative of your appetite for the rest of the year?
Brian Moynihan:
I think the answer on the size of buyback is absolutely because we just did it. So obviously, think of our appetite. The every business has an opportunity for growth. Some will have more RWA intense some will have less. If you notice, the RWAs in the industry have grown and ours have grown pretty rapidly. We need to all need to fine tune that. That's part due to the models and stuff that are being pushed around behind the scenes. I hope we get more rational discussion about But every business has the opportunity to grow.
We and so the most discreet decision we made was to put with Jim Demar and team is to give them more capital and capacity to grow and they have used that wisely. But if you look across our businesses that's the lowest return on allocated capital. So we have to be careful to get the returns. We have to make sure that the wealth management business and the consumer business, which have very high returns on capital are also growing. So everybody can grow if they need the capital.
They will take it down and we there's no the issue is always how much expense you can deploy to grow more than it is how much capital you can deploy.
Operator:
Thank you. We will move next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Two questions. One, a follow-up on what you were just talking about. Was wondering with relation to markets or WA, I thought in the past there had been no kind of ceiling on that now is gone. And can you talk to how much RWA you willing to allocate to the markets business?
Brian Moynihan:
As long as they can get the returns, that's the key because we got the dynamics of their return on capital. We got the dynamics of their impact on net interest income. So Jim and the team have got to get the returns and return on assets has to be moved towards 100 basis points and beyond. So there's no theoretical ceiling, it's just the dynamics of how far they can go before they do it. We went from a 6 or $700 billion balance sheet to base good trillion and that will ebb and flow based on clients activity The G buffer calculation, you know, we are not worried about that.
We have gone from basically two fifty to three, and it will move up. So we would not worry about that because as they are deploying, they are actually getting enough return that it's it's absorbing the impact to the rest of the company. That's the other thing you always have to be careful of is if markets can cause a G SIB trigger and it everybody pays for it and so we make sure that they can actually get to return it justifies not only what goes into their business but what the whole company experiences. And that's why it's the calibration is critical. They yep.
We got to get these things all work together, and the calibration of GSIP is critical. And the reality is that you have had a basic 20% growth in the capital requirements, so no major change in risk. Most of us across the last three or four years just by methodologies of GSIB creep and RWA calculations behind the scenes where they are pushing us on the models and stuff like that.
Alastair Borthwick:
But Betsy, we are not we are not aware of any RWA ceiling And the global markets business, as you have seen, it's just growing as the company grows and we have just continued to invest there.
Betsy Graseck:
Okay, great. And then follow-up question is just on the question on how you are approaching your wind and solar investments with the tax plan that is going through. Yes. How are you thinking about that business and how should we be how that will roll through your P and L?
Alastair Borthwick:
Yes. So, I read your report, think it was pretty good in terms of laying out what the issues are. What we are anticipating is there's going to be a period here where our clients are still going to want to install wind and solar. So we are obviously going to support that. Now they have to get them into production and they have to get it all they have to get construction started by a couple of different dates But you can think about it as between now and 2027 that's when you are going to see all of these things begin to slow and then stop.
We happen to have number one, an installed base of production tax credits, So that will stay with us. But those will begin to burn down over the course of the next eight years. That's the way I would think about that. And then the low-income housing tax credits are impacted. So we anticipate we will continue to be involved with those So I would say we are likely to be involved in deals for the next couple of years. And then you will start to see the portfolio come down in the course of 2028 the way through 02/1933? It will just burn down gradually over time, Betsy.
Betsy Graseck:
And then the housing, does the housing investments increase to offset that wind and solar fade?
Alastair Borthwick:
Well, that's largely a question of the size of that market. So if that market sort of grows with GDP, it may not increase in terms of the size that we do as a company. We are just supporting the clients that we are working with. But if it were to grow significantly, then it could take some of that gap. But I am not sure that will happen.
Brian Moynihan:
Yep. I think the housing has been a relatively constant number where the clean energy, the wind and solar in particular is going to be intertemporal now because of the stuff that goes on and the effects downstream, etcetera, like that. The housing is pretty consistent. It's just a question of how, as Alistair said, how big the demand can be and how competitive market other people go for it too. So I would expect that to come close to absorbing.
Operator:
Okay. Excellent. Thank you. We will move next to Chris McGratty with KBW. Your line is open.
Chris McGratty:
Great. Good morning. Morning, Chris. Brian, you have talked a lot about this responsible growth and the credit has been tremendous over the years. In terms of the journey on the growth portion, I am interested in your assessment of where you are versus where you desire to be. And then maybe secondarily, you know, a little bit more comments or color on the loan growth in the quarter, the conversations that you are having with borrowers, a degree of confidence? Thank you.
Brian Moynihan:
So I think, we always are pushing our team to grow faster loan growth faster and deposit growth, but faster and the economy grows and outgrow the economy and then turn that into strong profit. I think you have seen them do that. The commercial loan growth, leave aside the markets, you can look at and that has elements to it, are specific to the clients that we work with that are financing, pools of assets and etcetera. If you look in the core middle market, Wendy and the team done a good job growing the core middle market business even within nature of the frankly the commercial real estate flat to down.
So, she's grown I think 68% year over year absent commercial real estate. The business banking area, the loan growth was okay over the years. We now have added a lot of capacity that's up to fit demand. Our revenue companies we doubled the size of sales force by converting in some of the branch based sales force into that group. 've started to grow the balances now. We will see some growth there. It's a small portfolio of $13 billion Small business generally, which is a much larger portfolio, it's growing mid single digits or higher year over year. They have done a good job. So feel good about loan growth.
I think the key is that this customer demand and line usage is still down. So we have grown across the board, but we line usage moving to where it was more traditionally is yep, three or four percentage points of usage, which is a percent or two of loan growth on top of it. So we feel good about that just as customers get more used to the situation and it. So we feel good about the growth and we are seeing every consumer category I think grew a little bit this quarter and we can probably push a little harder some areas there and the team's works on that.
You know, you got to be careful of the volatility of consumer credit when we still have unemployment predicted to go up. In most of the surveys we look at. So we are being careful there too.
Chris McGratty:
Great. Thanks for that, Brian. And then secondarily, some of your peers have talked about the willingness to look externally for uses of capital. I may have missed this in your earlier remarks, but is there any aside from funding the balance sheet and some of your growth initiatives, there anything within the franchise that you would be looking to perhaps, allocate more capital externally? Thanks.
Brian Moynihan:
Yes. I mean, well, I think if you are talking about acquisitions in the deposit side, that's not available to us. But in technology space, we bought some companies over the several years that they are going to be relatively small uses. To we bought one in the medical payments area, then we can bring it to our scale and through. And so yeah, there's possibilities in that area. But really it's organic growth is the is the reality because the end of day, our huge deposit share for thirty years plus we have not been allowed to buy another depository institution. So that game is done.
How we got to do its organic expansion and that's what we did in all the markets and we are continuing that push expansion markets we call them and we are seeing success there and we will continue that push. But that's more of deployment of resources. So we take them out of places and push them. So we are down overall branches year over year You can see that, but in these new markets are growing. More of an expense redeployment question and a human being redeployment questions, we get the efficiencies that it is a capital deployment question,
Chris McGratty:
Right. Yeah. I was definitely referring to nonbank. So appreciate the color. Thanks, Brian.
Operator:
We will move next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Jim Mitchell:
Hey, good morning, everyone. Alistair, I know you do not want to give a hard target for NII for next year. I appreciate that. But with the high jumping off point and then you have a little more puts and takes than most, I guess. Do you have potential headwinds from the Bisbee accretion rolling off? You got rate cuts embedded in the forward curve? But loan growth and deposit growth are picking up, cash flow hedges are rolling off. Asset repricing. How does that all in your mind, how does it all fit together next year? Do you can you grow off that four q jumping off point? In your mind? Or Yes.
Just any thought thoughts would be great. And the answer is yes. No. Well, look, the answer to that is yes. It's because the company's built, as Brian said, for organic growth. So as we continue to add clients, as we do more with the existing client base, that's when you see the loan growth from the deposit growth coming through. So, there's always headwinds in any given year, but our mentality will be we come off of Q4, how do we grow NII sequentially each quarter from there. And we are going to benefit again from that fixed rate asset repricing again next year. So that acts as a tailwind.
First course is just a little bit different because of day count. But in general, I think you should think about NII as at least our expectation is we are just going to keep growing it quarter after quarter.
Jim Mitchell:
Okay. That's great. And just maybe just you had highlighted that balance sheet mix has changed a little bit. And your focus more on NII growth than NIM. I know you had historically or previously talked about a two twenty to two thirty longer term target. Is that different now? Or how do you think about that longer term target?
Alastair Borthwick:
No. It's not different. I just think, you know, any given quarter can be interesting. And this quarter was interesting because number one, we had really high volumes in active markets. So in a period like that global markets clients are asking us for balance sheet, we are going to provide that. Assuming it's well priced and we felt like it was. So, we saw the global markets business take on more in the way of earning assets that sometimes NY dilutive Right. But it can still be NII slightly positive. So you got a little bit of that going on.
And then in commercial, this quarter, we just took on some, I mentioned this in speech, but we took on a couple of very large commercial deposits at the end of the quarter. And those are you know, NII dilutive, but slightly NII positive. So I think in the grand scheme, this was just an interesting quarter where the NII came in slightly differently. But the long term remains a exactly the same. We are going to drive it back to that $220,000,000 to $2.30 with every available opportunity.
Jim Mitchell:
Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator:
It does appear that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Brian for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Moynihan:
So thank you again for spending the time with us this morning. Leave you where we started. We saw good organic client activity across the board We are now seeing the second half benefits of the kick in and we will expect to get the kick in NII pushing operating leverage back in the business. That will continue to be solid revenue growth earnings per share as we look forward And as we talked about and showed you some examples, we are now seeing the augmented intelligence, artificial intelligence, capacity starting to build in the company. Which will add to our efficiency efforts going forward. Thank you for your time and we look forward to talking next time.
Operator:
This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful afternoon."
